speaking unto him from above the ark cover that was upon the ark of the testimony from between the two cherubim and he spoke unto him and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto aaron and say unto him when thou lightest the lamps the seven lamps shall give light in front of the candlestick and aaron did so he lighted the lamps thereof so as to give light in front of the candlestick as the lord commanded moses and this was the work of the candlestick beaten work of gold unto the base thereof and unto the flowers thereof it was beaten work according unto the pattern which the lord had shown moses so he made the candlestick and the lord spoke unto moses saying take the levites from among the children of israel and cleanse them and thus shalt thou do unto them to cleanse them sprinkle the water of purification upon them and let them cause a razor to pass over all their flesh and let them wash their clothes and cleanse themselves then let them take a young bullock and its meal offering fine flour mingled with oil and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering and thou shalt present the levites before the tent of meeting and thou shalt assemble the whole congregation of the children of israel and thou shalt present the levites before the lord and the children of israel shall lay their hands upon the levites and aaron shall offer the levites before the lord for a wave offering from the children of israel that they may be to do the service of the lord and the levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks and offer thou the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering unto the lord to make atonement for the levites and thou shalt set the levites before aaron and before his sons and offer them for a wave offering unto the lord thus shalt thou separate the levites from among the children of israel and the levites shall be mine and after that shall the levites go in to do the service of the tent of meeting and thou shalt cleanse them and offer them for a wave offering for they are wholly given unto me from among the children of israel instead of all that openeth the womb even the first born of all the children of israel have i taken them unto me for all the first born among the children of israel are mine both man and beast on the day that i smote all the first born in the land of egypt i sanctified them for myself and i have taken the levites instead of all the first born among the children of israel and i have given the levites they are given to aaron and to his sons from among the children of israel to do the service of the children of israel in the tent of meeting and to make atonement for the children of israel that there be no plague among the children of israel through the children of israel coming nigh unto the sanctuary thus did moses and aaron and all the congregation of the children of israel unto the levites according unto all that the lord commanded moses touching the levites so did the children of israel unto them and the levites purified themselves and they washed their clothes and aaron offered them for a sacred gift before the lord and aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them and after that went the levites in to do their service in the tent of meeting before aaron and before his sons as the lord had commanded moses concerning the levites so did they unto them s and the lord spoke unto moses saying this is that which pertaineth unto the levites from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to perform the service in the work of the tent of meeting and from the age of fifty years they shall return from the service of the work and shall serve no more but shall minister with their brethren in the tent of meeting to keep the charge but they shall do no manner of service thus shalt thou do unto the levites touching their charges and the lord spoke unto moses in the wilderness of sinai in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of egypt saying let the children of israel keep the passover in its appointed season in the fourteenth day of this month at dusk ye shall keep it in its appointed season according to all the statutes of it and according to all the ordinances thereof shall ye keep it and moses spoke unto the children of israel that they should keep the passover and they kept the passover in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at dusk in the wilderness of sinai according to all that the lord commanded moses so did the children of israel but there were certain men who were unclean by the dead body of a man so that they could not keep the passover on that day and they came before moses and before aaron on that day and those men said unto him we are unclean by the dead body of a man wherefore are we to be kept back so as not to bring the offering of the lord in its appointed season among the children of israel and moses said unto them stay ye that i may hear what the lord will command concerning you and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel saying if any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body or be in a journey afar off yet he shall keep the passover unto the lord in the second month on the fourteenth day at dusk they shall keep it they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall leave none of it unto the morning nor break a bone thereof according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it but the man that is clean and is not on a journey and forbeareth to keep the passover that soul shall be cut off from his people because he brought not the offering of the lord in its appointed season that man shall bear his sin and if a stranger shall sojourn among you and will keep the passover unto the lord according to the statute of the passover and according to the ordinance thereof so shall he do ye shall have one statute both for the stranger and for him that is born in the land s and on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle even the tent of the testimony and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire until morning so it was alway the cloud covered it and the appearance of fire by night and whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tent then after that the children of israel journeyed and in the place where the cloud abode there the children of israel encamped at the commandment of the lord the children of israel journeyed and at the commandment of the lord they encamped as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped and when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days then the children of israel kept the charge of the lord and journeyed not and sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle according to the commandment of the lord they remained encamped and according to the commandment of the lord they journeyed and sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning and when the cloud was taken up in the morning they journeyed or if it continued by day and by night when the cloud was taken up they journeyed whether it were two days or a month or a year that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle abiding thereon the children of israel remained encamped and journeyed not but when it was taken up they journeyed at the commandment of the lord they encamped and at the commandment of the lord they journeyed they kept the charge of the lord at the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses and the lord spoke unto moses saying make thee two trumpets of silver of beaten work shalt thou make them and they shall be unto thee for the calling of the congregation and for causing the camps to set forward and when they shall blow with them all the congregation shall gather themselves unto thee at the door of the tent of meeting and if they blow but with one then the princes the heads of the thousands of israel shall gather themselves unto thee and when ye blow an alarm the camps that lie on the east side shall take their journey and when ye blow an alarm the second time the camps that lie on the south side shall set forward they shall blow an alarm for their journeys but when the assembly is to be gathered together ye shall blow but ye shall not sound an alarm and the sons of aaron the priests shall blow with the trumpets and they shall be to you for a statute for ever throughout your generations and when ye go to war in your land against the adversary that oppresseth you then ye shall sound an alarm with the trumpets and ye shall be remembered before the lord your god and ye shall be saved from your enemies also in the day of your gladness and in your appointed seasons and in your new moons ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings and they shall be to you for a memorial before your god i am the lord your god and it came to pass in the second year in the second month on the twentieth day of the month that the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony and the children of israel set forward by their stages out of the wilderness of sinai and the cloud abode in the wilderness of paran and they took their first journey according to the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses and in the first place the standard of the camp of the children of judah set forward according to their hosts and over his host was nahshon the son of amminadab and over the host of the tribe of the children of issachar was nethanel the son of zuar and over the host of the tribe of the children of zebulun was eliab the son of helon and the tabernacle was taken down and the sons of gershon and the sons of merari who bore the tabernacle set forward and the standard of the camp of reuben set forward according to their hosts and over his host was elizur the son of shedeur and over the host of the tribe of the children of simeon was shelumiel the son of zurishaddai and over the host of the tribe of the children of gad was eliasaph the son of deuel and the kohathites the bearers of the sanctuary set forward that the tabernacle might be set up against their coming and the standard of the camp of the children of ephraim set forward according to their hosts and over his host was elishama the son of ammihud and over the host of the tribe of the children of manasseh was gamaliel the son of pedahzur and over the host of the tribe of the children of benjamin was abidan the son of gideoni and the standard of the camp of the children of dan which was the rearward of all the camps set forward according to their hosts and over his host was ahiezer the son of ammishaddai and over the host of the tribe of the children of asher was pagiel the son of ochran and over the host of the tribe of the children of naphtali was ahira the son of enan thus were the journeyings of the children of israel according to their hosts and they set forward s and moses said unto hobab the son of reuel the midianite moses father in law we are journeying unto the place of which the lord said i will give it you come thou with us and we will do thee good for the lord hath spoken good concerning israel and he said unto him i will not go but i will depart to mine own land and to my kindred and he said leave us not i pray thee forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes and it shall be if thou go with us yea it shall be that what good soever the lord shall do unto us the same will we do unto thee and they set forward from the mount of the lord three days journey and the ark of the covenant of the lord went before them three days journey to seek out a resting place for them and the cloud of the lord was over them by day when they set forward from the camp s and it came to pass when the ark set forward that moses said rise up o lord and let thine enemies be scattered and let them that hate thee flee before thee and when it rested he said return o lord unto the ten thousands of the families of israel and the people were as murmurers speaking evil in the ears of the lord and when the lord heard it his anger was kindled and the fire of the lord burnt among them and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp and the people cried unto moses and moses prayed unto the lord and the fire abated and the name of that place was called taberah because the fire of the lord burnt among them and the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting and the children of israel also wept on their part and said would that we were given flesh to eat we remember the fish which we were wont to eat in egypt for nought the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic but now our soul is dried away there is nothing at all we have nought save this manna to look to now the manna was like coriander seed and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium the people went about and gathered it and ground it in mills or beat it in mortars and seethed it in pots and made cakes of it and the taste of it was as the taste of a cake baked with oil and when the dew fell upon the camp in the night the manna fell upon it and moses heard the people weeping family by family every man at the door of his tent and the anger of the lord was kindled greatly and moses was displeased and moses said unto the lord wherefore hast thou dealt ill with thy servant and wherefore have i not found favour in thy sight that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me have i conceived all this people have i brought them forth that thou shouldest say unto me carry them in thy bosom as a nursing father carrieth the sucking child unto the land which thou didst swear unto their fathers whence should i have flesh to give unto all this people for they trouble me with their weeping saying give us flesh that we may eat i am not able to bear all this people myself alone because it is too heavy for me and if thou deal thus with me kill me i pray thee out of hand if i have found favour in thy sight and let me not look upon my wretchedness and the lord said unto moses gather unto me seventy men of the elders of israel whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people and officers over them and bring them unto the tent of meeting that they may stand there with thee and i will come down and speak with thee there and i will take of the spirit which is upon thee and will put it upon them and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee that thou bear it not thyself alone and say thou unto the people sanctify yourselves against to morrow and ye shall eat flesh for ye have wept in the ears of the lord saying would that we were given flesh to eat for it was well with us in egypt therefore the lord will give you flesh and ye shall eat ye shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days neither ten days nor twenty days but a whole month until it come out at your nostrils and it be loathsome unto you because that ye have rejected the lord who is among you and have troubled him with weeping saying why now came we forth out of egypt and moses said the people among whom i am are six hundred thousand men on foot and yet thou hast said i will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month if flocks and herds be slain for them will they suffice them or if all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them will they suffice them and the lord said unto moses is the lord s hand waxed short now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not and moses went out and told the people the words of the lord and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and set them round about the tent and the lord came down in the cloud and spoke unto him and took of the spirit that was upon him and put it upon the seventy elders and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them they prophesied but they did so no more but there remained two men in the camp the name of the one was eldad and the name of the other medad and the spirit rested upon them and they were of them that were recorded but had not gone out unto the tent and they prophesied in the camp and there ran a young man and told moses and said eldad and medad are prophesying in the camp and joshua the son of nun the minister of moses from his youth up answered and said my lord moses shut them in and moses said unto him art thou jealous for my sake would that all the lord s people were prophets that the lord would put his spirit upon them and moses withdrew into the camp he and the elders of israel and there went forth a wind from the lord and brought across quails from the sea and let them fall by the camp about a day s journey on this side and a day s journey on the other side round about the camp and about two cubits above the face of the earth and the people rose up all that day and all the night and all the next day and gathered the quails he that gathered least gathered ten heaps and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp while the flesh was yet between their teeth ere it was chewed the anger of the lord was kindled against the people and the lord smote the people with a very great plague and the name of that place was called kibroth hattaavah because there they buried the people that lusted from kibroth hattaavah the people journeyed unto hazeroth and they abode at hazeroth and miriam and aaron spoke against moses because of the cushite woman whom he had married for he had married a cushite woman and they said hath the lord indeed spoken only with moses hath he not spoken also with us and the lord heard it now the man moses was very meek above all the men that were upon the face of the earth s and the lord spoke suddenly unto moses and unto aaron and unto miriam come out ye three unto the tent of meeting and they three came out and the lord came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the door of the tent and called aaron and miriam and they both came forth and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you i the lord do make myself known unto him in a vision i do speak with him in a dream my servant moses is not so he is trusted in all my house with him do i speak mouth to mouth even manifestly and not in dark speeches and the similitude of the lord doth he behold wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant against moses and the anger of the lord was kindled against them and he departed and when the cloud was removed from over the tent behold miriam was leprous as white as snow and aaron looked upon miriam and behold she was leprous and aaron said unto moses oh my lord lay not i pray thee sin upon us for that we have done foolishly and for that we have sinned let her not i pray be as one dead of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother s womb and moses cried unto the lord saying heal her now o god i beseech thee and the lord said unto moses if her father had but spit in her face should she not hide in shame seven days let her be shut up without the camp seven days and after that she shall be brought in again and miriam was shut up without the camp seven days and the people journeyed not till miriam was brought in again and afterward the people journeyed from hazeroth and pitched in the wilderness of paran and the lord spoke unto moses saying send thou men that they may spy out the land of canaan which i give unto the children of israel of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man every one a prince among them and moses sent them from the wilderness of paran according to the commandment of the lord all of them men who were heads of the children of israel and these were their names of the tribe of reuben shammua the son of zaccur of the tribe of simeon shaphat the son of hori of the tribe of judah caleb the son of jephunneh of the tribe of issachar igal the son of joseph of the tribe of ephraim hoshea the son of nun of the tribe of benjamin palti the son of raphu of the tribe of zebulun gaddiel the son of sodi of the tribe of joseph namely of the tribe of manasseh gaddi the son of susi of the tribe of dan ammiel the son of gemalli of the tribe of asher sethur the son of michael of the tribe of naphtali nahbi the son of vophsi of the tribe of gad geuel the son of machi these are the names of the men that moses sent to spy out the land and moses called hoshea the son of nun joshua and moses sent them to spy out the land of canaan and said unto them get you up here into the south and go up into the mountains and see the land what it is and the people that dwelleth therein whether they are strong or weak whether they are few or many and what the land is that they dwell in whether it is good or bad and what cities they are that they dwell in whether in camps or in strongholds and what the land is whether it is fat or lean whether there is wood therein or not and be ye of good courage and bring of the fruit of the land now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes so they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of zin unto rehob at the entrance to hamath and they went up into the south and came unto hebron and ahiman sheshai and talmai the children of anak were there now hebron was built seven years before zoan in egypt and they came unto the valley of eshcol and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bore it upon a pole between two they took also of the pomegranates and of the figs that place was called the valley of eshcol because of the cluster which the children of israel cut down from thence and they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days and they went and came to moses and to aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness of paran to kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came unto the land whither thou sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it howbeit the people that dwell in the land are fierce and the cities are fortified and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there amalek dwelleth in the land of the south and the hittite and the jebusite and the amorite dwell in the mountains and the canaanite dwelleth by the sea and along by the side of the jordan and caleb stilled the people toward moses and said we should go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we are not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they spread an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of israel saying the land through which we have passed to spy it out is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and there we saw the nephilim the sons of anak who come of the nephilim and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night and all the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would that we had died in the land of egypt or would we had died in this wilderness and wherefore doth the lord bring us unto this land to fall by the sword our wives and our little ones will be a prey were it not better for us to return into egypt and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into egypt then moses and aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of israel and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh who were of them that spied out the land rent their clothes and they spoke unto all the congregation of the children of israel saying the land which we passed through to spy it out is an exceeding good land if the lord delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it unto us a land which floweth with milk and honey only rebel not against the lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bread for us their defence is removed from over them and the lord is with us fear them not but all the congregation bade stone them with stones when the glory of the lord appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the children of israel and the lord said unto moses how long will this people despise me and how long will they not believe in me for all the signs which i have wrought among them i will smite them with the pestilence and destroy them and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they and moses said unto the lord when the egyptians shall hear for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them they will say to the inhabitants of this land who have heard that thou lord art in the midst of this people inasmuch as thou lord art seen face to face and thy cloud standeth over them and thou goest before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night now if thou shalt kill this people as one man then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak saying because the lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore unto them therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness and now i pray thee let the power of the lord be great according as thou hast spoken saying the lord is slow to anger and plenteous in lovingkindness forgiving iniquity and transgression and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children upon the third and upon the fourth generation pardon i pray thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy lovingkindness and according as thou hast forgiven this people from egypt even until now and the lord said i have pardoned according to thy word but in very deed as i live and all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the lord surely all those men that have seen my glory and my signs which i wrought in egypt and in the wilderness yet have put me to proof these ten times and have not hearkened to my voice surely they shall not see the land which i swore unto their fathers neither shall any of them that despised me see it but my servant caleb because he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fully him will i bring into the land whereinto he went and his seed shall possess it now the amalekite and the canaanite dwell in the vale tomorrow turn ye and get you into the wilderness by the way to the red sea and the lord spoke unto moses and unto aaron saying how long shall i bear with this evil congregation that keep murmuring against me i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel which they keep murmuring against me say unto them as i live saith the lord surely as ye have spoken in mine ears so will i do to you your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness and all that were numbered of you according to your whole number from twenty years old and upward ye that have murmured against me surely ye shall not come into the land concerning which i lifted up my hand that i would make you dwell therein save caleb the son of jephunneh and joshua the son of nun but your little ones that ye said would be a prey them will i bring in and they shall know the land which ye have rejected but as for you your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness and your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years and shall bear your strayings until your carcasses be consumed in the wilderness after the number of the days in which ye spied out the land even forty days for every day a year shall ye bear your iniquities even forty years and ye shall know my displeasure i the lord have spoken surely this will i do unto all this evil congregation that are gathered together against me in this wilderness they shall be consumed and there they shall die and the men whom moses sent to spy out the land and who when they returned made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up an evil report against the land even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land died by the plague before the lord but joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh remained alive of those men that went to spy out the land and moses told these words unto all the children of israel and the people mourned greatly and they rose up early in the morning and got them up to the top of the mountain saying lo we are here and will go up unto the place which the lord hath promised for we have sinned and moses said wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the lord seeing it shall not prosper go not up for the lord is not among you that ye be not smitten down before your enemies for there the amalekite and the canaanite are before you and ye shall fall by the sword forasmuch as ye are turned back from following the lord and the lord will not be with you but they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the lord and moses departed not out of the camp then the amalekite and the canaanite who dwelt in that hill country came down and smote them and beat them down even unto hormah and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye are come into the land of your habitations which i give unto you and will make an offering by fire unto the lord a burnt offering or a sacrifice in fulfilment of a vow clearly uttered or as a freewill offering or in your appointed seasons to make a sweet savour unto the lord of the herd or of the flock then shall he that bringeth his offering present unto the lord a meal offering of a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil and wine for the drink offering the fourth part of a hin shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice for each lamb or for a ram thou shalt prepare for a meal offering two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil and for the drink offering thou shalt present the third part of a hin of wine of a sweet savour unto the lord and when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering or for a sacrifice in fulfilment of a vow clearly uttered or for peace offerings unto the lord then shall there be presented with the bullock a meal offering of three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil and thou shalt present for the drink offering half a hin of wine for an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord thus shall it be done for each bullock or for each ram or for each of the he lambs or of the kids according to the number that ye may prepare so shall ye do for every one according to their number all that are home born shall do these things after this manner in presenting an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord and if a stranger sojourn with you or whosoever may be among you throughout your generations and will offer an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord as ye do so he shall do as for the congregation there shall be one statute both for you and for the stranger that sojourneth with you a statute for ever throughout your generations as ye are so shall the stranger be before the lord one law and one ordinance shall be both for you and for the stranger that sojourneth with you and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land whither i bring you then it shall be that when ye eat of the bread of the land ye shall set apart a portion for a gift unto the lord of the first of your dough ye shall set apart a cake for a gift as that which is set apart of the threshing floor so shall ye set it apart of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the lord a portion for a gift throughout your generations s and when ye shall err and not observe all these commandments which the lord hath spoken unto moses even all that the lord hath commanded you by the hand of moses from the day that the lord gave commandment and onward throughout your generations then it shall be if it be done in error by the congregation it being hid from their eyes that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the lord with the meal offering thereof and the drink offering thereof according to the ordinance and one he goat for a sin offering and the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of israel and they shall be forgiven for it was an error and they have brought their offering an offering made by fire unto the lord and their sin offering before the lord for their error and all the congregation of the children of israel shall be forgiven and the stranger that sojourneth among them for in respect of all the people it was done in error s and if one person sin through error then he shall offer a she goat of the first year for a sin offering and the priest shall make atonement for the soul that erreth when he sinneth through error before the lord to make atonement for him and he shall be forgiven both he that is home born among the children of israel and the stranger that sojourneth among them ye shall have one law for him that doeth aught in error but the soul that doeth aught with a high hand whether he be home born or a stranger the same blasphemeth the lord and that soul shall be cut off from among his people because he hath despised the word of the lord and hath broken his commandment that soul shall utterly be cut off his iniquity shall be upon him and while the children of israel were in the wilderness they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day and they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto moses and aaron and unto all the congregation and they put him in ward because it had not been declared what should be done to him s and the lord said unto moses the man shall surely be put to death all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp and all the congregation brought him without the camp and stoned him with stones and he died as the lord commanded moses and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and bid them that they make them throughout their generations fringes in the corners of their garments and that they put with the fringe of each corner a thread of blue and it shall be unto you for a fringe that ye may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the lord and do them and that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes after which ye use to go astray that ye may remember and do all my commandments and be holy unto your god i am the lord your god who brought you out of the land of egypt to be your god i am the lord your god now korah the son of izhar the son of kohath the son of levi with dathan and abiram the sons of eliab and on the son of peleth sons of reuben took men and they rose up in face of moses with certain of the children of israel two hundred and fifty men they were princes of the congregation the elect men of the assembly men of renown and they assembled themselves together against moses and against aaron and said unto them ye take too much upon you seeing all the congregation are holy every one of them and the lord is among them wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the assembly of the lord and when moses heard it he fell upon his face and he spoke unto korah and unto all his company saying in the morning the lord will show who are his and who is holy and will cause him to come near unto him even him whom he may choose will he cause to come near unto him this do take you censors korah and all his company and put fire therein and put incense upon them before the lord to morrow and it shall be that the man whom the lord doth choose he shall be holy ye take too much upon you ye sons of levi and moses said unto korah hear now ye sons of levi is it but a small thing unto you that the god of israel hath separated you from the congregation of israel to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the lord and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them and that he hath brought thee near and all thy brethren the sons of levi with thee and will ye seek the priesthood also therefore thou and all thy company that are gathered together against the lord and as to aaron what is he that ye murmur against him and moses sent to call dathan and abiram the sons of eliab and they said we will not come up is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness but thou must needs make thyself also a prince over us moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards wilt thou put out the eyes of these men we will not come up and moses was very wroth and said unto the lord respect not thou their offering i have not taken one ass from them neither have i hurt one of them and moses said unto korah be thou and all thy congregation before the lord thou and they and aaron to morrow and take ye every man his fire pan and put incense upon them and bring ye before the lord every man his fire pan two hundred and fifty fire pans thou also and aaron each his fire pan and they took every man his fire pan and put fire in them and laid incense thereon and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with moses and aaron and korah assembled all the congregation against them unto the door of the tent of meeting and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the congregation s and the lord spoke unto moses and unto aaron saying separate yourselves from among this congregation that i may consume them in a moment and they fell upon their faces and said o god the god of the spirits of all flesh shall one man sin and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation s and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto the congregation saying get you up from about the dwelling of korah dathan and abiram and moses rose up and went unto dathan and abiram and the elders of israel followed him and he spoke unto the congregation saying depart i pray you from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs lest ye be swept away in all their sins so they got them up from the dwelling of korah dathan and abiram on every side and dathan and abiram came out and stood at the door of their tents with their wives and their sons and their little ones and moses said hereby ye shall know that the lord hath sent me to do all these works and that i have not done them of mine own mind if these men die the common death of all men and be visited after the visitation of all men then the lord hath not sent me but if the lord make a new thing and the ground open her mouth and swallow them up with all that appertain unto them and they go down alive into the pit then ye shall understand that these men have despised the lord and it came to pass as he made an end of speaking all these words that the ground did cleave asunder that was under them and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their households and all the men that appertained unto korah and all their goods so they and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit and the earth closed upon them and they perished from among the assembly and all israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them for they said lest the earth swallow us up and fire came forth from the lord and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense s and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest that he take up the fire pans out of the burning and scatter thou the fire yonder for they are become holy even the fire pans of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar for they are become holy because they were offered before the lord that they may be a sign unto the children of israel and eleazar the priest took the brazen fire pans which they that were burnt had offered and they beat them out for a covering of the altar to be a memorial unto the children of israel to the end that no common man that is not of the seed of aaron draw near to burn incense before the lord that he fare not as korah and as his company as the lord spoke unto him by the hand of moses but on the morrow all the congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron saying ye have killed the people of the lord and it came to pass when the congregation was assembled against moses and against aaron that they looked toward the tent of meeting and behold the cloud covered it and the glory of the lord appeared and moses and aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting s and the lord spoke unto moses saying get you up from among this congregation that i may consume them in a moment and they fell upon their faces and moses said unto aaron take thy fire pan and put fire therein from off the altar and lay incense thereon and carry it quickly unto the congregation and make atonement for them for there is wrath gone out from the lord the plague is begun and aaron took as moses spoke and ran into the midst of the assembly and behold the plague was begun among the people and he put on the incense and made atonement for the people and he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was stayed now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred besides them that died about the matter of korah and aaron returned unto moses unto the door of the tent of meeting and the plague was stayed and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and take of them rods one for each fathers house of all their princes according to their fathers houses twelve rods thou shalt write every man s name upon his rod and thou shalt write aaron s name upon the rod of levi for there shall be one rod for the head of their fathers houses and thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony where i meet with you and it shall come to pass that the man whom i shall choose his rod shall bud and i will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of israel which they murmur against you and moses spoke unto the children of israel and all their princes gave him rods for each prince one according to their fathers houses even twelve rods and the rod of aaron was among their rods and moses laid up the rods before the lord in the tent of the testimony and it came to pass on the morrow that moses went into the tent of the testimony and behold the rod of aaron for the house of levi was budded and put forth buds and bloomed blossoms and bore ripe almonds and moses brought out all the rods from before the lord unto all the children of israel and they looked and took every man his rod and the lord said unto moses put back the rod of aaron before the testimony to be kept there for a token against the rebellious children that there may be made an end of their murmurings against me that they die not thus did moses as the lord commanded him so did he and the children of israel spoke unto moses saying behold we perish we are undone we are all undone every one that cometh near that cometh near unto the tabernacle of the lord is to die shall we wholly perish s and the lord said unto aaron thou and thy sons and thy fathers house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood and thy brethren also the tribe of levi the tribe of thy father bring thou near with thee that they may be joined unto thee and minister unto thee thou and thy sons with thee being before the tent of the testimony and they shall keep thy charge and the charge of all the tent only they shall not come nigh unto the holy furniture and unto the altar that they die not neither they nor ye and they shall be joined unto thee and keep the charge of the tent of meeting whatsoever the service of the tent may be but a common man shall not draw nigh unto you and ye shall keep the charge of the holy things and the charge of the altar that there be wrath no more upon the children of israel and i behold i have taken your brethren the levites from among the children of israel for you they are given as a gift unto the lord to do the service of the tent of meeting and thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood in everything that pertaineth to the altar and to that within the veil and ye shall serve i give you the priesthood as a service of gift and the common man that draweth nigh shall be put to death and the lord spoke unto aaron and i behold i have given thee the charge of my heave offerings even of all the hallowed things of the children of israel unto thee have i given them for a consecrated portion and to thy sons as a due for ever this shall be thine of the most holy things reserved from the fire every offering of theirs even every meal offering of theirs and every sin offering of theirs and every guilt offering of theirs which they may render unto me shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons in a most holy place shalt thou eat thereof every male may eat thereof it shall be holy unto thee and this is thine the heave offering of their gift even all the wave offerings of the children of israel i have given them unto thee and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee as a due for ever every one that is clean in thy house may eat thereof all the best of the oil and all the best of the wine and of the corn the first part of them which they give unto the lord to thee have i given them the first ripe fruits of all that is in their land which they bring unto the lord shall be thine every one that is clean in thy house may eat thereof every thing devoted in israel shall be thine every thing that openeth the womb of all flesh which they offer unto the lord both of man and beast shall be thine howbeit the first born of man shalt thou surely redeem and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem and their redemption money from a month old shalt thou redeem them shall be according to thy valuation five shekels of silver after the shekel of the sanctuary the same is twenty gerahs but the firstling of an ox or the firstling of a sheep or the firstling of a goat thou shalt not redeem they are holy thou shalt dash their blood against the altar and shalt make their fat smoke for an offering made by fire for a sweet savour unto the lord and the flesh of them shall be thine as the wave breast and as the right thigh it shall be thine all the heave offerings of the holy things which the children of israel offer unto the lord have i given thee and thy sons and thy daughters with thee as a due for ever it is an everlasting covenant of salt before the lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee and the lord said unto aaron thou shalt have no inheritance in their land neither shalt thou have any portion among them i am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of israel s and unto the children of levi behold i have given all the tithe in israel for an inheritance in return for their service which they serve even the service of the tent of meeting and henceforth the children of israel shall not come nigh the tent of meeting lest they bear sin and die but the levites alone shall do the service of the tent of meeting and they shall bear their iniquity it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations and among the children of israel they shall have no inheritance for the tithe of the children of israel which they set apart as a gift unto the lord i have given to the levites for an inheritance therefore i have said unto them among the children of israel they shall have no inheritance and the lord spoke unto moses saying moreover thou shalt speak unto the levites and say unto them when ye take of the children of israel the tithe which i have given you from them for your inheritance then ye shall set apart of it a gift for the lord even a tithe of the tithe and the gift which ye set apart shall be reckoned unto you as though it were the corn of the threshing floor and as the fulness of the wine press thus ye also shall set apart a gift unto the lord of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of israel and thereof ye shall give the gift which is set apart unto the lord to aaron the priest out of all that is given you ye shall set apart all of that which is due unto the lord of all the best thereof even the hallowed part thereof out of it therefore thou shalt say unto them when ye set apart the best thereof from it then it shall be counted unto the levites as the increase of the threshing floor and as the increase of the wine press and ye may eat it in every place ye and your households for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting and ye shall bear no sin by reason of it seeing that ye have set apart from it the best thereof and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of israel that ye die not and the lord spoke unto moses and unto aaron saying this is the statute of the law which the lord hath commanded saying speak unto the children of israel that they bring thee a red heifer faultless wherein is no blemish and upon which never came yoke and ye shall give her unto eleazar the priest and she shall be brought forth without the camp and she shall be slain before his face and eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times and the heifer shall be burnt in his sight her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung shall be burnt and the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer then the priest shall wash his clothes and he shall bathe his flesh in water and afterward he may come into the camp and the priest shall be unclean until the even and he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh in water and shall be unclean until the even and a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of israel for a water of sprinkling it is a purification from sin and he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even and it shall be unto the children of israel and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them for a statute for ever he that toucheth the dead even any man s dead body shall be unclean seven days the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day and on the seventh day and he shall be clean but if he purify not himself the third day and the seventh day he shall not be clean whosoever toucheth the dead even the body of any man that is dead and purifieth not himself he hath defiled the tabernacle of the lord that soul shall be cut off from israel because the water of sprinkling was not dashed against him he shall be unclean his uncleanness is yet upon him this is the law when a man dieth in a tent every one that cometh into the tent and every thing that is in the tent shall be unclean seven days and every open vessel which hath no covering close bound upon it is unclean and whosoever in the open field toucheth one that is slain with a sword or one that dieth of himself or a bone of a man or a grave shall be unclean seven days and for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the purification from sin and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel and a clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water and sprinkle it upon the tent and upon all the vessels and upon the persons that were there and upon him that touched the bone or the slain or the dead or the grave and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day and on the seventh day he shall purify him and he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean at even but the man that shall be unclean and shall not purify himself that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the lord the water of sprinkling hath not been dashed against him he is unclean and it shall be a perpetual statute unto them and he that sprinkleth the water of sprinkling shall wash his clothes and he that toucheth the water of sprinkling shall be unclean until even and whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean and the soul that toucheth him shall be unclean until even and the children of israel even the whole congregation came into the wilderness of zin in the first month and the people abode in kadesh and miriam died there and was buried there and there was no water for the congregation and they assembled themselves together against moses and against aaron and the people strove with moses and spoke saying would that we had perished when our brethren perished before the lord and why have ye brought the assembly of the lord into this wilderness to die there we and our cattle and wherefore have ye made us to come up out of egypt to bring us in unto this evil place it is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates neither is there any water to drink and moses and aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tent of meeting and fell upon their faces and the glory of the lord appeared unto them and the lord spoke unto moses saying take the rod and assemble the congregation thou and aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes that it give forth its water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle drink and moses took the rod from before the lord as he commanded him and moses and aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock and he said unto them hear now ye rebels are we to bring you forth water out of this rock and moses lifted up his hand and smote the rock with his rod twice and water came forth abundantly and the congregation drank and their cattle s and the lord said unto moses and aaron because ye believed not in me to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of israel therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which i have given them these are the waters of meribah where the children of israel strove with the lord and he was sanctified in them s and moses sent messengers from kadesh unto the king of edom thus saith thy brother israel thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us how our fathers went down into egypt and we dwelt in egypt a long time and the egyptians dealt ill with us and our fathers and when we cried unto the lord he heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us forth out of egypt and behold we are in kadesh a city in the uttermost of thy border let us pass i pray thee through thy land we will not pass through field or through vineyard neither will we drink of the water of the wells we will go along the king s highway we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left until we have passed thy border and edom said unto him thou shalt not pass through me lest i come out with the sword against thee and the children of israel said unto him we will go up by the highway and if we drink of thy water i and my cattle then will i give the price thereof let me only pass through on my feet there is no hurt and he said thou shalt not pass through and edom came out against him with much people and with a strong hand thus edom refused to give israel passage through his border wherefore israel turned away from him and they journeyed from kadesh and the children of israel even the whole congregation came unto mount hor and the lord spoke unto moses and aaron in mount hor by the border of the land of edom saying aaron shall be gathered unto his people for he shall not enter into the land which i have given unto the children of israel because ye rebelled against my word at the waters of meribah take aaron and eleazar his son and bring them up unto mount hor and strip aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazar his son and aaron shall be gathered unto his people and shall die there and moses did as the lord commanded and they went up into mount hor in the sight of all the congregation and moses stripped aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazar his son and aaron died there in the top of the mount and moses and eleazar came down from the mount and when all the congregation saw that aaron was dead they wept for aaron thirty days even all the house of israel s and the canaanite the king of arad who dwelt in the south heard tell that israel came by the way of atharim and he fought against israel and took some of them captive and israel vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand then i will utterly destroy their cities and the lord hearkened to the voice of israel and delivered up the canaanites and they utterly destroyed them and their cities and the name of the place was called hormah and they journeyed from mount hor by the way to the red sea to compass the land of edom and the soul of the people became impatient because of the way and the people spoke against god and against moses wherefore have ye brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread and there is no water and our soul loatheth this light bread and the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of israel died and the people came to moses and said we have sinned because we have spoken against the lord and against thee pray unto the lord that he take away the serpents from us and moses prayed for the people and the lord said unto moses make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he seeth it shall live and moses made a serpent of brass and set it upon the pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he looked unto the serpent of brass he lived and the children of israel journeyed and pitched in oboth and they journeyed from oboth and pitched at ije abarim in the wilderness which is in front of moab toward the sun rising from thence they journeyed and pitched in the valley of zered from thence they journeyed and pitched on the other side of the arnon which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the border of the amorites for arnon is the border of moab between moab and the amorites wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the lord vaheb in suphah and the valleys of arnon and the slope of the valleys that inclineth toward the seat of ar and leaneth upon the border of moab and from thence to beer that is the well whereof the lord said unto moses gather the people together and i will give them water s then sang israel this song spring up o well sing ye unto it the well which the princes digged which the nobles of the people delved with the sceptre and with their staves and from the wilderness to mattanah and from mattanah to nahaliel and from nahaliel to bamoth and from bamoth to the valley that is in the field of moab by the top of pisgah which looketh down upon the desert and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites saying let me pass through thy land we will not turn aside into field or into vineyard we will not drink of the water of the wells we will go by the king s highway until we have passed thy border and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through his border but sihon gathered all his people together and went out against israel into the wilderness and came to jahaz and he fought against israel and israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possessed his land from the arnon unto the jabbok even unto the children of ammon for the border of the children of ammon was strong and israel took all these cities and israel dwelt in all the cities of the amorites in heshbon and in all the towns thereof for heshbon was the city of sihon the king of the amorites who had fought against the former king of moab and taken all his land out of his hand even unto the arnon wherefore they that speak in parables say come ye to heshbon let the city of sihon be built and established for a fire is gone out of heshbon a flame from the city of sihon it hath devoured ar of moab the lords of the high places of arnon woe to thee moab thou art undone o people of chemosh he hath given his sons as fugitives and his daughters into captivity unto sihon king of the amorites we have shot at them heshbon is perished even unto dibon and we have laid waste even unto nophah which reacheth unto medeba thus israel dwelt in the land of the amorites and moses sent to spy out jazer and they took the towns thereof and drove out the amorites that were there and they turned and went up by the way of bashan and og the king of bashan went out against them he and all his people to battle at edrei and the lord said unto moses fear him not for i have delivered him into thy hand and all his people and his land and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites who dwelt at heshbon so they smote him and his sons and all his people until there was none left him remaining and they possessed his land and the children of israel journeyed and pitched in the plains of moab beyond the jordan at jericho s and balak the son of zippor saw all that israel had done to the amorites and moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many and moab was overcome with dread because of the children of israel and moab said unto the elders of midian now will this multitude lick up all that is round about us as the ox licketh up the grass of the field and balak the son of zippor was king of moab at that time and he sent messengers unto balaam the son of beor to pethor which is by the river to the land of the children of his people to call him saying behold there is a people come out from egypt behold they cover the face of the earth and they abide over against me come now therefore i pray thee curse me this people for they are too mighty for me peradventure i shall prevail that we may smite them and that i may drive them out of the land for i know that he whom thou blessest is blessed and he whom thou cursest is cursed and the elders of moab and the elders of midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand and they came unto balaam and spoke unto him the words of balak and he said unto them lodge here this night and i will bring you back word as the lord may speak unto me and the princes of moab abode with balaam and god came unto balaam and said what men are these with thee and balaam said unto god balak the son of zippor king of moab hath sent unto me saying behold the people that is come out of egypt it covereth the face of the earth now come curse me them peradventure i shall be able to fight against them and shall drive them out and god said unto balaam thou shalt not go with them thou shalt not curse the people for they are blessed and balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of balak get you into your land for the lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you and the princes of moab rose up and they went unto balak and said balaam refuseth to come with us and balak sent yet again princes more and more honourable than they and they came to balaam and said to him thus saith balak the son of zippor let nothing i pray thee hinder thee from coming unto me for i will promote thee unto very great honour and whatsoever thou sayest unto me i will do come therefore i pray thee curse me this people and balaam answered and said unto the servants of balak if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the word of the lord my god to do any thing small or great now therefore i pray you tarry ye also here this night that i may know what the lord will speak unto me more and god came unto balaam at night and said unto him if the men are come to call thee rise up go with them but only the word which i speak unto thee that shalt thou do and balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass and went with the princes of moab and god s anger was kindled because he went and the angel of the lord placed himself in the way for an adversary against him now he was riding upon his ass and his two servants were with him and the ass saw the angel of the lord standing in the way with his sword drawn in his hand and the ass turned aside out of the way and went into the field and balaam smote the ass to turn her into the way then the angel of the lord stood in a hollow way between the vineyards a fence being on this side and a fence on that side and the ass saw the angel of the lord and she thrust herself unto the wall and crushed balaam s foot against the wall and he smote her again and the angel of the lord went further and stood in a narrow place where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left and the ass saw the angel of the lord and she lay down under balaam and balaam s anger was kindled and he smote the ass with his staff and the lord opened the mouth of the ass and she said unto balaam what have i done unto thee that thou hast smitten me these three times and balaam said unto the ass because thou hast mocked me i would there were a sword in my hand for now i had killed thee and the ass said unto balaam am not i thine ass upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day was i ever wont to do so unto thee and he said nay then the lord opened the eyes of balaam and he saw the angel of the lord standing in the way with his sword drawn in his hand and he bowed his head and fell on his face and the angel of the lord said unto him wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times behold i am come forth for an adversary because thy way is contrary unto me and the ass saw me and turned aside before me these three times unless she had turned aside from me surely now i had even slain thee and saved her alive and balaam said unto the angel of the lord i have sinned for i knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me now therefore if it displease thee i will get me back and the angel of the lord said unto balaam go with the men but only the word that i shall speak unto thee that thou shalt speak so balaam went with the princes of balak and when balak heard that balaam was come he went out to meet him unto ir moab which is on the border of arnon which is in the utmost part of the border and balak said unto balaam did i not earnestly send unto thee to call thee wherefore camest thou not unto me am i not able indeed to promote thee to honour and balaam said unto balak lo i am come unto thee have i now any power at all to speak any thing the word that god putteth in my mouth that shall i speak and balaam went with balak and they came unto kiriath huzoth and balak sacrificed oxen and sheep and sent to balaam and to the princes that were with him and it came to pass in the morning that balak took balaam and brought him up into bamoth baal and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams and balak did as balaam had spoken and balak and balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram and balaam said unto balak stand by thy burnt offering and i will go peradventure the lord will come to meet me and whatsoever he showeth me i will tell thee and he went to a bare height and god met balaam and he said unto him i have prepared the seven altars and i have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar and the lord put a word in balaam s mouth and said return unto balak and thus thou shalt speak and he returned unto him and lo he stood by his burnt offering he and all the princes of moab and he took up his parable and said from aram balak bringeth me the king of moab from the mountains of the east come curse me jacob and come execrate israel how shall i curse whom god hath not cursed and how shall i execrate whom the lord hath not execrated for from the top of the rocks i see him and from the hills i behold him lo it is a people that shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations who hath counted the dust of jacob or numbered the stock of israel let me die the death of the righteous and let mine end be like his and balak said unto balaam what hast thou done unto me i took thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast blessed them altogether and he answered and said must i not take heed to speak that which the lord putteth in my mouth and balak said unto him come i pray thee with me unto another place from whence thou mayest see them thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shalt not see them all and curse me them from thence and he took him into the field of zophim to the top of pisgah and built seven altars and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar and he said unto balak stand here by thy burnt offering while i go toward a meeting yonder and the lord met balaam and put a word in his mouth and said return unto balak and thus shalt thou speak and he came to him and lo he stood by his burnt offering and the princes of moab with him and balak said unto him what hath the lord spoken and he took up his parable and said arise balak and hear give ear unto me thou son of zippor god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent when he hath said will he not do it or when he hath spoken will he not make it good behold i am bidden to bless and when he hath blessed i cannot call it back none hath beheld iniquity in jacob neither hath one seen perverseness in israel the lord his god is with him and the shouting for the king is among them god who brought them forth out of egypt is for them like the lofty horns of the wild ox for there is no enchantment with jacob neither is there any divination with israel now is it said of jacob and of israel what hath god wrought behold a people that riseth up as a lioness and as a lion doth he lift himself up he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey and drink the blood of the slain and balak said unto balaam neither curse them at all nor bless them at all but balaam answered and said unto balak told not i thee saying all that the lord speaketh that i must do and balak said unto balaam come now i will take thee unto another place peradventure it will please god that thou mayest curse me them from thence and balak took balaam unto the top of peor that looketh down upon the desert and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams and balak did as balaam had said and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar and when balaam saw that it pleased the lord to bless israel he went not as at the other times to meet with enchantments but he set his face toward the wilderness and balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw israel dwelling tribe by tribe and the spirit of god came upon him and he took up his parable and said the saying of balaam the son of beor and the saying of the man whose eye is opened the saying of him who heareth the words of god who seeth the vision of the almighty fallen down yet with opened eyes how goodly are thy tents o jacob thy dwellings o israel as valleys stretched out as gardens by the river side as aloes planted of the lord as cedars beside the waters water shall flow from his branches and his seed shall be in many waters and his king shall be higher than agag and his kingdom shall be exalted god who brought him forth out of egypt is for him like the lofty horns of the wild ox he shall eat up the nations that are his adversaries and shall break their bones in pieces and pierce them through with his arrows he couched he lay down as a lion and as a lioness who shall rouse him up blessed be every one that blesseth thee and cursed be every one that curseth thee and balak s anger was kindled against balaam and he smote his hands together and balak said unto balaam i called thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast altogether blessed them these three times therefore now flee thou to thy place i thought to promote thee unto great honour but lo the lord hath kept thee back from honour and balaam said unto balak spoke i not also to thy messengers that thou didst send unto me saying if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the word of the lord to do either good or bad of mine own mind what the lord speaketh that will i speak and now behold i go unto my people come and i will announce to thee what this people shall do to thy people in the end of days and he took up his parable and said the saying of balaam the son of beor and the saying of the man whose eye is opened the saying of him who heareth the words of god and knoweth the knowledge of the most high who seeth the vision of the almighty fallen down yet with opened eyes i see him but not now i behold him but not nigh there shall step forth a star out of jacob and a scepter shall rise out of israel and shall smite through the corners of moab and break down all the sons of seth and edom shall be a possession seir also even his enemies shall be a possession while israel doeth valiantly and out of jacob shall one have dominion and shall destroy the remnant from the city and he looked on amalek and took up his parable and said amalek was the first of the nations but his end shall come to destruction and he looked on the kenite and took up his parable and said though firm be thy dwelling place and though thy nest be set in the rock nevertheless kain shall be wasted how long asshur shall carry thee away captive and he took up his parable and said alas who shall live after god hath appointed him but ships shall come from the coast of kittim and they shall afflict asshur and shall afflict eber and he also shall come to destruction and balaam rose up and went and returned to his place and balak also went his way and israel abode in shittim and the people began to commit harlotry with the daughters of moab and they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods and the people did eat and bowed down to their gods and israel joined himself unto the baal of peor and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and the lord said unto moses take all the chiefs of the people and hang them up unto the lord in face of the sun that the fierce anger of the lord may turn away from israel and moses said unto the judges of israel slay ye every one his men that have joined themselves unto the baal of peor and behold one of the children of israel came and brought unto his brethren a midianitish woman in the sight of moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of israel while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting and when phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest saw it he rose up from the midst of the congregation and took a spear in his hand and he went after the man of israel into the chamber and thrust both of them through the man of israel and the woman through her belly so the plague was stayed from the children of israel and those that died by the plague were twenty and four thousand and the lord spoke unto moses saying phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest hath turned my wrath away from the children of israel in that he was very jealous for my sake among them so that i consumed not the children of israel in my jealousy wherefore say behold i give unto him my covenant of peace and it shall be unto him and to his seed after him the covenant of an everlasting priesthood because he was jealous for his god and made atonement for the children of israel now the name of the man of israel that was slain who was slain with the midianitish woman was zimri the son of salu a prince of a fathers house among the simeonites and the name of the midianitish woman that was slain was cozbi the daughter of zur he was head of the people of a fathers house in midian and the lord spoke unto moses saying harass the midianites and smite them for they harass you by their wiles wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of peor and in the matter of cozbi the daughter of the prince of midian their sister who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of peor and it came to pass after the plague that the lord spoke unto moses and unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest saying take the sum of all the

shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth also when a woman voweth a vow unto the lord and bindeth herself by a bond being in her father s house in her

at her and disallowed her not then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand but if her husband make them null and void in the day that he heareth them then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips whether it were her vows or the bond of her soul shall not stand her husband hath made them void and the lord will forgive her every vow and every binding oath to

which are upon her he hath let them stand because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them but if he shall make them null and void after that he hath heard them then he shall bear her iniquity these are the statutes which the lord commanded moses between a man and his wife between a father and his daughter being in her youth in her father s house and the lord spoke unto moses saying avenge the children of israel of the midianites afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people and moses spoke unto the people saying arm ye men from among you for the war that they may go against midian to execute the lord s vengeance on midian of every tribe a thousand throughout all the tribes of israel shall ye send to the war so there were delivered out of the thousands of israel a thousand of every tribe twelve thousand armed for war and moses sent them a thousand of every tribe to the war them and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest to the war with the holy vessels and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand and they warred against midian as the lord commanded moses and they slew every male and they slew the kings of midian with the rest of their slain evi and rekem and zur and hur and reba the five kings of midian balaam also the son of beor they slew with the sword and the children of israel took captive the women of midian and their little ones and all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods they took for a prey and all their cities in the places wherein they dwelt and all their encampments they burnt with fire and they took all the spoil and all the prey both of man and of beast and they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil unto moses and unto eleazar the priest and unto the congregation of the children of israel unto the camp unto the plains of moab which are by the jordan at jericho s and moses and eleazar the priest and all the princes of the congregation went forth to meet them without the camp and moses was wroth with the officers of the host the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds who came from the service of the war and moses said unto them have ye saved all the women alive behold these caused the children of israel through the counsel of balaam to revolt so as to break faith with the lord in the matter of peor and so the plague was among the congregation of the lord now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him but all the women children that have not known man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves and encamp ye without the camp seven days whosoever hath killed any person and whosoever hath touched any slain purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day ye and your captives and as to every garment and all that is made of skin and all work of goats hair and all things made of wood ye shall purify s and eleazar the priest said unto the men of war that went to the battle this is the statute of the law which the lord hath commanded moses howbeit the gold and the silver the brass the iron the tin and the lead every thing that may abide the fire ye shall make to go through the fire and it shall be clean nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of sprinkling and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make to go through the water and ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and ye shall be clean and afterward ye may come into the camp s and the lord spoke unto moses saying take the sum of the prey that was taken both of man and of beast thou and eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers houses of the congregation and divide the prey into two parts between the men skilled in war that went out to battle and all the congregation and levy a tribute unto the lord of the men of war that went out to battle one soul of five hundred both of the persons and of the beeves and of the asses and of the flocks take it of their half and give it unto eleazar the priest as a portion set apart for the lord and of the children of israel s half thou shalt take one drawn out of every fifty of the persons of the beeves of the asses and of the flocks even of all the cattle and give them unto the levites that keep the charge of the tabernacle of the lord and moses and eleazar the priest did as the lord commanded moses now the prey over and above the booty which the men of war took was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep and threescore and twelve thousand beeves and threescore and one thousand asses and thirty and two thousand persons in all of the women that had not known man by lying with him and the half which was the portion of them that went out to war was in number three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep and the lord s tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen and the beeves were thirty and six thousand of which the lord s tribute was threescore and twelve and the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred of which the lord s tribute was threescore and one and the persons were sixteen thousand of whom the lord s tribute was thirty and two persons and moses gave the tribute which was set apart for the lord unto eleazar the priest as the lord commanded moses and of the children of israel s half which moses divided off from the men that warred now the congregation s half was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep and thirty and six thousand beeves and thirty thousand and five hundred asses and sixteen thousand persons even of the children of israel s half moses took one drawn out of every fifty both of man and of beast and gave them unto the levites that kept the charge of the tabernacle of the lord as the lord commanded moses and the officers that were over the thousands of the host the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds came near unto moses and they said unto moses thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war that are under our charge and there lacketh not one man of us and we have brought the lord s offering what every man hath gotten of jewels of gold armlets and bracelets signet rings ear rings and girdles to make atonement for our souls before the lord and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of them even all wrought jewels and all the gold of the gift that they set apart for the lord of the captains of thousands and of the captains of hundreds was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels for the men of war had taken booty every man for himself and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting for a memorial for the children of israel before the lord now the children of reuben and the children of gad had a very great multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of jazer and the land of gilead that behold the place was a place for cattle the children of gad and the children of reuben came and spoke unto moses and to eleazar the priest and unto the princes of the congregation saying ataroth and dibon and jazer and nimrah and heshbon and elealeh and sebam and nebo and beon the land which the lord smote before the congregation of israel is a land for cattle and thy servants have cattle s and they said if we have found favour in thy sight let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession bring us not over the jordan and moses said unto the children of gad and to the children of reuben shall your brethren go to the war and shall ye sit here and wherefore will ye turn away the heart of the children of israel from going over into the land which the lord hath given them thus did your fathers when i sent them from kadesh barnea to see the land for when they went up unto the valley of eshcol and saw the land they turned away the heart of the children of israel that they should not go into the land which the lord had given them and the lord s anger was kindled in that day and he swore saying surely none of the men that came up out of egypt from twenty years old and upward shall see the land which i swore unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob because they have not wholly followed me save caleb the son of jephunneh the kenizzite and joshua the son of nun because they have wholly followed the lord and the lord s anger was kindled against israel and he made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the lord was consumed and behold ye are risen up in your fathers stead a brood of sinful men to augment yet the fierce anger of the lord toward israel for if ye turn away from after him he will yet again leave them in the wilderness and so ye will destroy all this people s and they came near unto him and said we will build sheepfolds here for our cattle and cities for our little ones but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of israel until we have brought them unto their place and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land we will not return unto our houses until the children of israel have inherited every man his inheritance for we will not inherit with them on the other side of the jordan and forward because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the jordan eastward and moses said unto them if ye will do this thing if ye will arm yourselves to go before the lord to the war and every armed man of you will pass over the jordan before the lord until he hath driven out his enemies from before him and the land be subdued before the lord and ye return afterward then ye shall be clear before the lord and before israel and this land shall be unto you for a possession before the lord but if ye will not do so behold ye have sinned against the lord and know ye your sin which will find you build you cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth and the children of gad and the children of reuben spoke unto moses saying thy servants will do as my lord commandeth our little ones our wives our flocks and all our cattle shall be there in the cities of gilead but thy servants will pass over every man that is armed for war before the lord to battle as my lord saith so moses gave charge concerning them to eleazar the priest and to joshua the son of nun and to the heads of the fathers houses of the tribes of the children of israel and moses said unto them if the children of gad and the children of reuben will pass with you over the jordan every man that is armed to battle before the lord and the land shall be subdued before you then ye shall give them the land of gilead for a possession but if they will not pass over with you armed they shall have possessions among you in the land of canaan and the children of gad and the children of reuben answered saying as the lord hath said unto thy servants so will we do we will pass over armed before the lord into the land of canaan and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the jordan and moses gave unto them even to the children of gad and to the children of reuben and unto the half tribe of manasseh the son of joseph the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites and the kingdom of og king of bashan the land according to the cities thereof with their borders even the cities of the land round about and the children of gad built dibon and ataroth and aroer and atroth shophan and jazer and jogbehah and beth nimrah and beth haran fortified cities and folds for sheep and the children of reuben built heshbon and elealeh and kiriathaim and nebo and baal meon their names being changed and sibmah and gave their names unto the cities which they builded and the children of machir the son of manasseh went to gilead and took it and dispossessed the amorites that were therein and moses gave gilead unto machir the son of manasseh and he dwelt therein and jair the son of manasseh went and took the villages thereof and called them havvoth jair and nobah went and took kenath and the villages thereof and called it nobah after his own name these are the stages of the children of israel by which they went forth out of the land of egypt by their hosts under the hand of moses and aaron and moses wrote

unto moses in the plains of moab by the jordan at jericho saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye pass over the jordan into the land of canaan then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their figured stones and destroy all their molten images and demolish all their high places and ye shall drive out the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for unto you have i given the land to possess it and ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families to the more ye shall give the more inheritance and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance wheresoever the lot falleth to any man that shall be his according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherit but if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then shall those that ye let remain of them be as thorns in your eyes and as pricks in your sides and they shall harass you in the land wherein ye dwell and it shall come to pass that as i thought to do unto them so will i do unto you and the lord spoke unto moses saying command the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land of canaan this shall be the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance even the land of canaan according to the borders thereof thus your south side shall be from the wilderness of zin close by the side of edom and

to give unto the nine tribes and to the half tribe for the tribe of the children of reuben according to their fathers houses and the tribe of the children of gad according to their fathers houses have received and the half tribe of manasseh have received their inheritance the two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance beyond the jordan at jericho eastward toward the sun rising and the lord spoke unto moses saying these are the names of the men that shall take possession of the land for you eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun and ye shall take one prince of every tribe to take possession of the land and these are the names of the men of the tribe of judah caleb the son of jephunneh and of the tribe of the children of simeon shemuel the son of ammihud of the tribe of benjamin elidad the son of chislon and of the tribe of the children of dan a prince bukki the son of jogli of the children of joseph of the tribe of the children of manasseh a prince hanniel

the children of issachar a prince paltiel the son of azzan and of the tribe of the children of asher a prince ahihud the son of shelomi and of the tribe of the children of naphtali a prince pedahel the son of ammihud these are they whom the lord commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of israel in the land of canaan and the lord spoke unto moses in the plains of moab by the jordan at jericho saying command the children of israel that they give unto the levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in and open land round about the cities shall ye give unto the levites and the cities shall they have to dwell in and their open land shall be for their cattle and for their substance and for all their beasts and the open land about the cities which ye shall give unto the levites shall be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about and ye shall measure without the city for the east side two thousand cubits and for the south side two thousand cubits and for the west side two thousand cubits and for the north side two thousand cubits the city being in the midst this shall be to them the open land about the cities and the cities which ye shall give unto the levites they shall be the six cities of refuge which ye shall give for the manslayer to flee thither and beside them ye shall give forty and two cities all the cities which ye shall give to the levites shall be forty and eight cities them shall ye give with the open land about them and concerning the cities which ye shall give of the possession of the children of israel from the many ye shall take many and from the few ye shall take few each tribe according to its inheritance which it inheriteth shall give of its cities unto the levites and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye pass over the jordan into the land of canaan then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you that the manslayer that killeth any person through error may flee thither and the cities shall be unto you for refuge from the avenger that the manslayer die not until he stand before the congregation for judgment and as to the cities which ye shall give there shall be for you six cities of refuge ye shall give three cities beyond the jordan and three cities shall ye give in the land of canaan they shall be cities of refuge for the children of israel and for the stranger and for the settler among them shall these six cities be for refuge that every one that killeth any person through error may flee thither but if he smote him with an instrument of iron so that he died he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death and if he smote him with a stone in the hand whereby a man may die and he died he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand whereby a man may die and he died he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death the avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death when he meeteth him he shall put him to death and if he thrust him of hatred or hurled at him any thing lying in wait so that he died or in enmity smote him with his hand that he died he that smote him shall surely be put to death he is a murderer the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meeteth him but if he thrust him suddenly without enmity or hurled upon him any thing without lying in wait or with any stone whereby a man may die seeing him not and cast it upon him so that he died and he was not his enemy neither sought his harm then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge whither he was fled and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil but if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge whither he fleeth and the avenger of blood find him without the border of his city of refuge and the avenger of blood slay the manslayer there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him because he must remain in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest but after the death of the high priest the manslayer may return into the land of his possession and these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings whoso killeth any person the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer that is guilty of death but he shall surely be put to death and ye shall take no ransom for him that is fled to his city of refuge that he should come again to dwell in the land until the death of the priest so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are for blood it polluteth the land and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein but by the blood of him that shed it and thou shalt not defile the land which ye inhabit in the midst of which i dwell for i the lord dwell in the midst of the children of israel and the heads of the fathers houses of the family of the children of gilead the son of machir the son of manasseh of the families of the sons of joseph came near and spoke before moses and before the princes the heads of the fathers houses of the children of israel and they said the lord commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of israel and my lord was commanded by the lord to give the inheritance of zelophehad our brother unto his daughters and if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of israel then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance and when the jubilee of the children of israel shall be then will their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers and moses commanded the children of israel according to the word of the lord saying the tribe of the sons of joseph speaketh right this is the thing which the lord hath commanded concerning the daughters of zelophehad saying let them be married to whom they think best only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married so shall no inheritance of the children of israel remove from tribe to tribe for the children of israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers and every daughter that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of israel shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father that the children of israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers so shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe for the tribes of the children of israel shall cleave each one to its own inheritance even as the lord commanded moses so did the daughters of zelophehad for mahlah tirzah and hoglah and milcah and noah the daughters of zelophehad were married unto their father s brothers sons they were married into the families of the sons of manasseh the son of joseph and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father these are the commandments and the ordinances which the lord commanded by the hand of moses unto the children of israel in the plains of moab by the jordan at jericho
