of france and pharamond the founder of this law and female barre yet their owne authors faithfully affirme that the land salike is in germanie betweene the flouds of sala and of elue where charles the great hauing subdu d the saxons there left behind and settled certaine french who holding in disdaine the german women for some dishonest manners of their life establisht then this law to wit no female should be inheritrix in salike land which salike as i said twixt elue and sala is at this day in germanie call d meisen then doth it well appeare the salike law was not deuised for the realme of france nor did the french possesse the salike land vntill foure hundred one and twentie yeeres after defunction of king pharamond idly suppos d the founder of this law who died within the yeere of our redemption foure hundred twentie six and charles the great subdu d the saxons and did seat the french beyond the riuer sala in the yeere eight hundred fiue besides their writers say king pepin which deposed childerike did as heire generall being descended of blithild which was daughter to king clothair make clayme and title to the crowne of france hugh capet also who vsurpt the crowne of charles the duke of loraine sole heire male of the true line and stock of charles the great to find his title with some shewes of truth though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught conuey d himselfe as th heire to th lady lingare daughter to charlemaine who was the sonne to lewes the emperour and lewes the sonne of charles the great also king lewes the tenth who was sole heire to the vsurper capet could not keepe quiet in his conscience wearing the crowne of france till satisfied that faire queene isabel his grandmother was lineall of the lady ermengare daughter to charles the foresaid

his satisfaction all appeare to hold in right and title of the female so doe the kings of france vnto this day howbeit they would hold vp this salique law to barre your highnesse clayming from the

play d a tragedie making defeat on the full power of france whiles his most mightie father on a hill stood smiling to behold his lyons whelpe forrage in blood of french nobilitie o noble english that could entertaine with halfe their forces the full pride of france and let another halfe stand laughing by all out of worke and cold for action bish awake remembrance of these valiant dead and with your puissant arme renew their feats you are their heire you sit vpon their throne the blood and courage that renowned them runs in your veines and my thrice puissant liege is in the very may morne of his youth ripe for exploits and mightie enterprises exe your brother kings and monarchs of the earth doe all expect that you should rowse your selfe as did the former lyons of your blood west they know your grace hath cause and means and might so hath your highnesse neuer king of england had nobles richer and more loyall subiects whose hearts haue left their bodyes here in england and lye pauillion d in the fields of france bish can o let their bodyes follow my deare liege with bloods and sword and fire to win your right in ayde whereof we of the spiritualtie will rayse your highnesse such a mightie summe as neuer did the clergie at one time bring in to any of your ancestors king we must not onely arme t inuade the french but lay downe our proportions to defend against the scot who will make roade vpon vs with all aduantages bish can they of those marches gracious soueraign shall be a wall sufficient to defend our in land from the pilfering borderers king we do not meane the coursing snatchers onely but feare the maine intendment of the scot who hath been still a giddy neighbour to vs for you shall reade that my great grandfather neuer went with his forces into france but that the scot on his vnfurnisht kingdome came pouring like the tyde into a breach with ample and brim fulnesse of his force galling the gleaned land with hot assayes girding with grieuous siege castles and townes that england being emptie of defence hath shooke and trembled at th ill neighbourhood b can she hath bin the n more fear d the n harm d my liege for heare her but exampl d by her selfe when all her cheualrie hath been in france and shee a mourning widdow of her nobles shee hath her selfe not onely well defended but taken and impounded as a stray the king of scots whom shee did send to france to fill king edwards fame with prisoner kings and make their chronicle as rich with prayse as is the owse and bottome of the sea with sunken wrack and sum lesse treasuries bish ely but there s a saying very old and true if that you will france win then with scotland first begin for once the eagle england being in prey to her vnguarded nest the weazell scot comes sneaking and so sucks her princely egges playing the mouse in absence of the cat to tame and hauocke more then she can eate exet it followes then the cat must stay at home yet that is but a crush d necessity since we haue lockes to safegard necessaries and pretty traps to catch the petty theeues while that the armed hand doth fight abroad th aduised head defends it selfe at home for gouernment though high and low and lower put into parts doth keepe in one consent congreeing in a full and natural close like musicke cant therefore doth heauen diuide the state of man in diuers functions setting endeuour in continual motion to which is fixed as an ayme or butt obedience for so worke the hony bees creatures that by a rule in nature teach the act of order to a peopled kingdome they haue a king and officers of sorts where some like magistrates correct at home others like merchants venter trade abroad others like souldiers armed in their stings make boote vpon the summers veluet buddes which pillage they with merry march bring home to the tent royal of their emperor who busied in his maiesties surueyes the singing masons building roofes of gold the ciuil citizens kneading vp the hony the poore mechanicke porters crowding in their heauy burthens at his narrow gate the sad ey d iustice with his surly humme deliuering ore to executors pale the lazie yawning drone i this inferre that many things hauing full reference to one consent may worke contrariously as many arrowes loosed seuerall wayes come to one marke as many wayes meet in one towne as many fresh streames meet in one salt sea as many lynes close in the dials center so may a thousand actions once a foote and in one purpose and be all well borne without defeat therefore to france my liege diuide your happy england into foure whereof take you one quarter into france and you withall shall make all gallia shake if we with thrice such powers left at home cannot defend our owne doores from the dogge let vs be worried and our nation lose the name of hardinesse and policie king call in the messengers sent from the dolphin now are we well resolu d and by gods helpe and yours the noble sinewes of our power france being ours wee l bend it to our awe or breake it all to peeces or there wee l sit ruling in large and ample emperie ore france and all her almost kingly dukedomes or lay these bones in an vnworthy vrne tomblesse

leaue freely to render what we haue in charge or shall we sparingly shew you farre off the dolphins meaning and our embassie king we are no tyrant but a christian king vnto whose grace our passion is as subiect as is our wretches fettred in our prisons therefore with franke and with vncurbed plainnesse tell vs the dolphins minde amb thus than in few your highnesse lately sending into france did claime some certaine dukedomes in the right of your great predecessor king edward the third in answer of which claime the prince our master sayes that you sauour too much of your youth and bids you be aduis d there s nought in france that can be with a nimble galliard wonne you cannot reuell into dukedomes there he therefore sends you meeter for your spirit this tun of treasure and in lieu of this desires you let the dukedomes that you claime heare no more of you this the dolphin speakes king what treasure vncle exe tennis balles my liege kin we are glad the dolphin is so pleasant with vs his present and your paines we thanke you for when we haue matcht our rackets to these balles we will in france by gods grace play a set shall strike his fathers crowne into the hazard tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler that all the courts of france will be disturb d with chaces and we vnderstand him well how he comes o re vs with our wilder dayes not measuring what vse we made of them we neuer valew d this poore seate of england and therefore liuing hence did giue our selfe to barbarous license as tis euer common that men are merriest when they are from home but tell the dolphin i will keepe my state be like a king and shew my sayle of greatnesse when i do rowse me in my throne of france for that i haue layd by my maiestie and plodded like a man for working dayes but i will rise there with so full a glorie that i will dazle all the eyes of france yea strike the dolphin blinde to looke on vs and tell the pleasant prince this mocke of his hath turn d his balles to gun stones and his soule shall stand sore charged for the wastefull vengeance that shall flye with them for many a thousand widows shall this his mocke mocke out of their deer husbands mocke mothers from their sonnes mock castles downe and some are yet vngotten and vnborne that shal haue cause to curse the dolphins scorne but this lyes all within the wil of god to whom i do appeale and in whose name tel you the dolphin i am comming on to venge me as i may and to put forth my rightfull hand in a wel hallow d cause so get you hence in peace and tell the dolphin his iest will sauour but of shallow wit when thousands weepe more then did laugh at it conuey them with safe conduct fare you well exeunt ambassadors exe this was a merry message king we hope to make the sender blush at it therefore my lords omit no happy howre that may giue furth rance to our expedition for we haue now no thought in vs but france saue those to god that runne before our businesse therefore let our proportions for these warres be soone collected and all things thought vpon that may with reasonable swiftnesse adde more feathers to our wings for god before wee le chide this dolphin at his fathers doore therefore let euery man now taske his thought that this faire action may on foot be brought exeunt flourish enter chorus now all the youth of england are on fire and silken dalliance in the

brother iohn bates is not that the morning which breakes yonder bates i thinke it be but wee haue no great cause to desire the approach of day williams wee see yonder the beginning of the day but i thinke wee shall neuer see the end of it who goes there king a friend williams vnder what captaine serue you king vnder sir iohn erpingham williams a good old commander and a most kinde gentleman i pray you what thinkes he of our estate king euen as men wrackt vpon a sand that looke to be washt off the next tyde bates he hath not told his thought to the king king no nor it is not meet he should for though i speake it to you i thinke the king is but a man as i am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the element shewes to him as it doth to me all his sences haue but humane conditions his ceremonies layd by in his nakednesse he appeares but a man and though his affections are higher mounted then ours yet when they stoupe they stoupe with the like wing therefore when he sees reason of feares as we doe his feares out of doubt be of the same rellish as ours are yet in reason no man should possesse him with any appearance of feare least hee by shewing it should dis hearten his army bates he may shew what outward courage he will but i beleeue as cold a night as tis hee could wish himselfe in thames vp to the neck and so i would he were and i by him at all aduentures so we were quit here king by my troth i will speake my conscience of the king i thinke hee would not wish himselfe any where but where hee is bates then i would he were here alone so should he be sure to be ransomed and a many poore mens liues saued king i dare say you loue him not so ill to wish him here alone howsoeuer you speake this to feele other mens minds me thinks i could not dye any where so contented as in the kings company his cause being iust and his quarrell honorable williams that s more then we know bates i or more then wee should seeke after for wee know enough if wee know wee are the kings subiects if his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes the cryme of it out of vs williams but if the cause be not good the king himselfe hath a heauie reckoning to make when all those legges and armes and heads chopt off in a battaile shall ioyne together at the latter day and cry all wee dyed at such a place some swearing some crying for a surgean some vpon their wiues left poore behind them some vpon the debts they owe some vpon their children rawly left i am afear d there are few dye well that dye in a battaile for how can they charitably dispose of any thing when blood is their argument now if these men doe not dye well it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it who to disobey were against all proportion of subiection king so if a sonne that is by his father sent about merchandize doe sinfully miscarry vpon the sea the imputation of his wickednesse by your rule should be imposed vpon his father that sent him or if a seruant vnder his masters command transporting a summe of money be assayled by robbers and dye in many irreconcil d iniquities you may call the businesse of the master the author of the seruants damnation but this is not so the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his souldiers the father of his sonne nor the master of his seruant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their seruices besides there is no king be his cause neuer so spotlesse if it come to the arbitrement of swords can trye it out with all vnspotted souldiers some peraduenture haue on them the guilt of premeditated and contriued murther some of beguiling virgins with the broken seales of periurie some making the warres their bulwarke that haue before gored the gentle bosome of peace with pillage and robberie now if these men haue defeated the law and outrunne natiue punishment though they can out strip men they haue no wings to flye from god warre is his beadle warre is his vengeance so that here men are punisht for before breach of the kings lawes in now the kings quarrell where they feared the death they haue borne life away and where they would bee safe they perish then if they dye vnprouided no more is the king guiltie of their damnation then hee was before guiltie of those impieties for the which they are now visited euery subiects dutie is the kings but euery subiects soule is his owne therefore should euery souldier in the warres doe as euery sicke man in his bed wash euery moth out of his conscience and dying so death is to him aduantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gayned and in him that escapes it were not sinne to thinke that making god so free an offer he let him outliue that day to see his greatnesse and to teach others how they should prepare will tis certaine euery man that dyes ill the ill vpon his owne head the king is not to answer it bates i doe not desire hee should answer for me and yet i determine to fight lustily for him king i my selfe heard the king say he would not be ransom d will i hee said so to make vs fight chearefully but when our throats are cut hee may be ransom d and wee ne re the wiser king if i liue to
