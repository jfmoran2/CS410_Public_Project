doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perish why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the lord and against his anointed saying let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from us he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh the lord shall have them in derision then shall he speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in his sore displeasure yet have i set my king upon my holy hill of zion i will declare the decree the lord hath said unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee ask of me and i shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession thou shalt break them with a rod of iron

under his feet and he rode upon a cherub and did fly yea he did fly upon the wings of the wind he made darkness his secret place his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies at the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed hail stones and coals of fire the lord also thundered in the heavens and the highest gave his voice hail stones and coals of fire yea he sent out his arrows and scattered them and he shot out lightnings and discomfited them then the channels of waters were seen and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke o lord at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them which hated me for they were too strong

righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me for i have kept the ways of the lord and have not wickedly departed from my god for all his judgments were before me and i

continually let the lord be magnified which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant and my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long the transgression of the wicked saith within my heart that there is no fear of god before his eyes for he flattereth himself in his own eyes until his iniquity be found to be hateful the words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit he hath left off to be wise and to do good he deviseth mischief upon his bed he setteth himself in a way that is not good he abhorreth not evil thy mercy o lord is in the heavens and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds thy righteousness is like the great mountains thy judgments are a great deep o lord thou preservest man and beast how excellent is thy lovingkindness o god

pleasures for with thee is the fountain of life in thy light shall we see light o continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee and thy righteousness to the upright in heart let not the foot of pride come against me and let not the hand of the wicked remove me there are the workers of iniquity fallen they are cast down and shall not be able to rise fret not thyself because of evildoers

bringeth wicked devices to pass cease from anger and forsake wrath fret not thyself in any wise to do evil for evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the lord they shall inherit the earth for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be yea thou shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not be but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace the wicked plotteth against the just and gnasheth upon him with his teeth the lord shall laugh at him for he seeth that his day is coming the wicked have drawn out the sword and have bent their bow to cast down the poor and needy and to slay such as be of upright conversation their sword shall enter into their own heart and their bows shall be broken a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked for the arms of the wicked shall be broken but the lord upholdeth the righteous the lord knoweth the days of the upright and their inheritance shall be for ever they shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied but the wicked shall perish and the enemies of the lord shall be as the fat of lambs they shall consume into smoke shall they consume away the wicked borroweth and payeth not again but the righteous sheweth mercy and giveth for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand i have been young and now am old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread he is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed depart from evil and do good and dwell for evermore for the lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his saints they are preserved for ever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein for ever the mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom and his tongue talketh of judgment the law of his god is in his heart none of his steps shall slide the wicked watcheth the righteous and seeketh to slay him the lord will not leave him in his hand nor condemn him when he is judged wait on the lord and keep his way and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off thou shalt see it i have seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself like a green bay tree yet he passed away and lo he was not yea i sought him but he could not be found mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peace but the transgressors shall be destroyed together the end of the wicked shall be cut off but the salvation of the righteous is of the lord he is their strength in the time of trouble and the lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him o lord rebuke me not in thy wrath neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure for thine arrows stick fast in me and thy hand presseth me sore there is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin for mine iniquities are gone over mine head as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me my wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness i am troubled i am bowed down greatly i go mourning all the day long for my loins are filled with a loathsome disease and there is no soundness in my flesh i am feeble and sore broken i have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart lord all my desire is before thee and my groaning is not hid from thee my heart panteth my strength faileth me as for the light of mine eyes it also is gone from me my lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore and my kinsmen stand afar off they also that seek after my life lay snares for me and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things and imagine deceits all the day long but i as a deaf man heard not and i was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth thus i was as a man that heareth not and in whose mouth are no reproofs for in thee o lord do i hope thou wilt hear o lord my god for i said hear me lest otherwise they should rejoice over me when my foot slippeth they magnify themselves against me for i am ready to halt and my sorrow is continually before me for i will declare mine iniquity i will be sorry for my sin but mine enemies are lively and they are strong and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied they also that render evil for good are mine adversaries because i follow the thing that good is forsake me not o lord o my god be not far from me make haste to help me o lord my salvation i said i will take heed to my ways that i sin not with my tongue i will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me i was dumb with silence i held my peace even from good and my sorrow was stirred my heart was hot within me while i was musing the fire burned then spake i with my tongue lord make me to know mine end and the measure of my days what it is that i may know how frail i am behold thou hast made my days as an handbreadth and mine age is as nothing before thee verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity selah surely every man walketh in a vain shew surely they are disquieted in vain he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall gather them and now lord what wait i for my hope is in thee deliver me from all my transgressions make me not the reproach of the foolish i was dumb i opened not my mouth because thou didst it remove thy stroke away from me i am consumed by the blow of thine hand when thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth surely every man is vanity selah hear my prayer o lord and give ear unto my cry hold not thy peace at my tears for i am a stranger with thee and a sojourner as all my fathers were o spare me that i may recover strength before i go hence and be no more i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cry he brought me up also out of an horrible pit out of the miry clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our god many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the lord blessed is that man that maketh the lord his trust and respecteth not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies many o lord my god are thy wonderful works which thou hast done and thy thoughts which are to us ward they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee if i would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire mine ears hast thou opened burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me i delight to do thy will o my god yea thy law is within my heart i have preached righteousness in the great congregation lo i have not refrained my lips o lord thou knowest i have not hid thy righteousness within my heart i have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation i have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me o lord let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me for innumerable evils have compassed me about mine iniquities have taken hold upon me so that i am not able to look up they are more than the hairs of mine head therefore my heart faileth me be pleased o lord to deliver me o lord make haste to help me let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me aha aha let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee let such as love thy salvation say continually the lord be magnified but i am poor and needy yet the lord thinketh upon me thou art my help and my deliverer make no tarrying o my god blessed is he that considereth the poor the lord will deliver him in time of trouble the lord will preserve him and keep him alive and he shall be blessed upon the earth and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies the lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness i said lord be merciful unto me heal my soul for i have sinned against thee mine enemies speak evil of me when shall he die and his name perish and if he come to see me he speaketh vanity his heart gathereth iniquity to itself when he goeth abroad he telleth it all that hate me whisper together against me against me do they devise my hurt an evil disease say they cleaveth fast unto him and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more yea mine own familiar friend in whom i trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me but thou o lord be merciful unto me and raise me up that i may requite them by this i know that thou favourest me because mine enemy doth not triumph over me and as for me thou upholdest me in mine integrity and settest me before thy face for ever blessed be the lord god of israel from everlasting and to everlasting amen and amen as the hart panteth after the water brooks so panteth my soul after thee o god my soul thirsteth for god for the living god when shall i come and appear before god my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy god when i remember these things i pour out my soul in me for i had gone with the multitude i went with them to the house of god with the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holyday why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted in me hope thou in god for i shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance o my god my soul is cast down within me therefore will i remember thee from the land of jordan and of the hermonites from the hill mizar deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me yet the lord will command his lovingkindness in the day time and in the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto the god of my life i will say unto god my rock why hast thou forgotten me why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy as with a sword in my bones mine enemies reproach me while they say daily unto me where is thy god why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted within me hope thou in god for i shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my god judge me o god and plead my cause against an ungodly nation o deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man for thou art the god of my strength why dost thou cast me off why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy o send out thy light and thy truth let them lead me let them bring me unto thy holy hill and to thy tabernacles then will i go unto the altar of god unto god my exceeding joy yea upon the harp will i praise thee o god my god why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted within me hope in god for i shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my god we have heard with our ears o god our fathers have told us what work thou didst in their days in the times of old how thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand and plantedst them how thou didst afflict the people and cast them out for they got not the land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand and thine arm and the light of thy countenance because thou hadst a favour unto them thou art my king o god command deliverances for jacob through thee will we push down our enemies through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us for i will not trust in my bow neither shall my sword save me but thou hast saved us from our enemies and hast put them to shame that hated us in god we boast all the day long and praise thy name for ever selah but thou hast cast off and put us to shame and goest not forth with our armies thou makest us to turn back from the enemy and they which hate us spoil for themselves thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat and hast scattered us among the heathen thou sellest thy people for nought and dost not increase thy wealth by their price thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us thou makest us a byword among the heathen a shaking of the head among the people my confusion is continually before me and the shame of my face hath covered me for the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth by reason of the enemy and avenger all this is come upon us yet have we not forgotten thee neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant our heart is not turned back neither have our steps declined from thy way though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons and covered us with the shadow of death if we have forgotten the name of our god or stretched out our hands to a strange god shall not god search this out for he knoweth the secrets of the heart yea for thy sake are we killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter awake why sleepest thou o lord arise cast us not off for ever wherefore hidest thou thy face and forgettest our affliction and our oppression for our soul is bowed down to the dust our belly cleaveth unto the earth arise for our help and redeem us for thy mercies sake my heart is inditing a good matter i speak of the things which i have made touching the king my tongue is the pen of a ready writer thou art fairer than the children of men grace is poured into thy lips therefore god hath blessed thee for ever gird thy sword upon thy thigh o most mighty with thy glory and thy majesty and in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king s enemies whereby the people fall under thee thy throne o god is for ever and ever the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness therefore god thy god hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows all thy garments smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of the ivory palaces whereby they have made thee glad kings daughters were among thy honourable women upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of ophir hearken o daughter and consider and incline thine ear forget also thine own people and thy father s house so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty for he is thy lord and worship thou him and the daughter of tyre shall be there with a gift even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour the king s daughter is all glorious within her clothing is of wrought gold she shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought they shall enter into the king s palace instead of thy fathers shall be thy children whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth i will make thy name to be remembered in all generations therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever god is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof selah there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of god the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high god is in the midst of her she shall not be moved god shall help her and that right early the heathen raged the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice the earth melted the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge selah come behold the works of the lord what desolations he hath made in the earth he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth he breaketh the bow and cutteth the spear in sunder he burneth the chariot in the fire be still and know that i am god i will be exalted among the heathen i will be exalted in the earth the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge selah o clap your hands all ye people shout unto god with the voice of triumph for the lord most high is terrible he is a great king over all the earth he shall subdue the people under us and the nations under our feet he shall choose our inheritance for us the excellency of jacob whom he loved selah god is gone up with a shout the lord with the sound of a trumpet sing praises to god sing praises sing praises unto our king sing praises for god is the king of all the earth sing ye praises with understanding god reigneth over the heathen god sitteth upon the throne of his holiness the princes of the people are gathered together even the people of the god of abraham for the shields of the earth belong unto god he is greatly exalted great is the lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our god in the mountain of his holiness beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth is mount zion on the sides of the north the city of the great king god is known in her palaces for a refuge for lo the kings were assembled they passed by together they saw it and so they marvelled they were troubled and hasted away fear took hold upon them there and pain as of a woman in travail thou breakest the ships of tarshish with an east wind as we have heard so have we seen in the city of the lord of hosts in the city of our god god will establish it for ever selah we have thought of thy lovingkindness o god in the midst of thy temple according to thy name o god so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth thy right hand is full of righteousness let mount zion rejoice let the daughters of judah be glad because of thy judgments walk about zion and go round about her tell the towers thereof mark ye well her bulwarks consider her palaces that ye may tell it to the generation following for this god is our god for ever and ever he will be our guide even unto death hear this all ye people give ear all ye inhabitants of the world both low and high rich and poor together my mouth shall speak of wisdom and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding i will incline mine ear to a parable i will open my dark saying upon the harp wherefore should i fear in the days of evil when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about they that trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches none of them can by any means redeem his brother nor give to god a ransom for him for the redemption of their soul is precious and it ceaseth for ever that he should still live for ever and not see corruption for he seeth that wise men die likewise the fool and the brutish person perish and leave their wealth to others their inward thought is that their houses shall continue for ever and their dwelling places to all generations they call their lands after their own names nevertheless man being in honour abideth not he is like the beasts that perish this their way is their folly yet their posterity approve their sayings selah like sheep they are laid in the grave death shall feed on them and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling but god will redeem my soul from the power of the grave for he shall receive me selah be not thou afraid when one is made rich when the glory of his house is increased for when he dieth he shall carry nothing away his glory shall not descend after him though while he lived he blessed his soul and men will praise thee when thou doest well to thyself he shall go to the generation of his fathers they shall never see light man that is in honour and understandeth not is like the beasts that perish the mighty god even the lord hath spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof out of zion the perfection of beauty god hath shined our god shall come and shall not keep silence a fire shall devour before him and it shall be very tempestuous round about him he shall call to the heavens from above and to the earth that he may judge his people gather my saints together unto me those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice and the heavens shall declare his righteousness for god is judge himself selah hear o my people and i will speak o israel and i will testify against thee i am god even thy god i will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings to have been continually before me i will take no bullock out of thy house nor he goats out of thy folds for every beast of the forest is mine and the cattle upon a thousand hills i know all the fowls of the mountains and the wild beasts of the field are mine if i were hungry i would not tell thee for the world is mine and the fulness thereof will i eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats offer unto god thanksgiving and pay thy vows unto the most high and call upon me in the day of trouble i will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me but unto the wicked god saith what hast thou to do to declare my statutes or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth seeing thou hatest instruction and casteth my words behind thee when thou sawest a thief then thou consentedst with him and hast been partaker with adulterers thou givest thy mouth to evil and thy tongue frameth deceit thou sittest and speakest against thy brother thou slanderest thine own mother s son these things hast thou done and i kept silence thou thoughtest that i was altogether such an one as thyself but i will reprove thee and set them in order before thine eyes now consider this ye that forget god lest i tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver whoso offereth praise glorifieth me and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will i shew the salvation of god have mercy upon me o god according to thy lovingkindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions wash me throughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee thee only have i sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest behold i was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities create in me a clean heart o god and renew a right spirit within me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit then will i teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee deliver me from bloodguiltiness o god thou god of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness o lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise for thou desirest not sacrifice else would i give it thou delightest not in burnt offering the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise do good in thy good pleasure unto zion build thou the walls of jerusalem then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness with burnt offering and whole burnt offering then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar why boastest thou thyself in mischief o mighty man the goodness of god endureth continually thy tongue deviseth mischiefs like a sharp razor working deceitfully thou lovest evil more than good and lying rather than to speak righteousness selah thou lovest all devouring words o thou deceitful tongue god shall likewise destroy thee for ever he shall take thee away and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place and root thee out of the land of the living selah the righteous also shall see and fear and shall laugh at him lo this is the man that made not god his strength but trusted in the abundance of his riches and strengthened himself in his wickedness but i am like a green olive tree in the house of god i trust in the mercy of god for ever and ever i will praise thee for ever because thou hast done it and i will wait on thy name for it is good before thy saints the fool hath said in his heart there is no god corrupt are they and have done abominable iniquity there is none that doeth good god looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand that did seek god every one of them is gone back they are altogether become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one have the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread they have not called upon god there were they in great fear where no fear was for god hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee thou hast put them to shame because god hath despised them oh that the salvation of israel were come out of zion when god bringeth back the captivity of his people jacob shall rejoice and israel shall be glad save me o god by thy name and judge me by thy strength hear my prayer o god give ear to the words of my mouth for strangers are risen up against me and oppressors seek after my soul they have not set god before them selah behold god is mine helper the lord is with them that uphold my soul he shall reward evil unto mine enemies cut them off in thy truth i will freely sacrifice unto thee i will praise thy name o lord for it is good for he hath delivered me out of all trouble and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies give ear to my prayer o god and hide not thyself from my supplication attend unto me and hear me i mourn in my complaint and make a noise because of the voice of the enemy because of the oppression of the wicked for they cast iniquity upon me and in wrath they hate me my heart is sore pained within me and the terrors of death are fallen upon me fearfulness and trembling are come upon me and horror hath overwhelmed me and i said oh that i had wings like a dove for then would i fly away and be at rest lo then would i wander far off and remain in the wilderness selah i would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest destroy o lord and divide their tongues for i have seen violence and strife in the city day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it wickedness is in the midst thereof deceit and guile depart not from her streets for it was not an enemy that reproached me then i could have borne it neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me then i would have hid myself from him but it was thou a man mine equal my guide and mine acquaintance we took sweet counsel together and walked unto the house of god in company let death seize upon them and let them go down quick into hell for wickedness is in their dwellings and among them as for me i will call upon god and the lord shall save me evening and morning and at noon will i pray and cry aloud and he shall hear my voice he hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me for there were many with me god shall hear and afflict them even he that abideth of old selah because they have no changes therefore they fear not god he hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him he hath broken his covenant the words of his mouth were smoother than butter but war was in his heart his words were softer than oil yet were they drawn swords cast thy burden upon the lord and he shall sustain thee he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved but thou o god shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days but i will trust in thee be merciful unto me o god for man would swallow me up he fighting daily oppresseth me mine enemies would daily swallow me up for they be many that fight against me o thou most high what time i am afraid i will trust in thee in god i will praise his word in god i have put my trust i will not fear what flesh can do unto me every day they wrest my words all their thoughts are against me for evil they gather themselves together they hide themselves they mark my steps when they wait for my soul shall they escape by iniquity in thine anger cast down the people o god thou tellest my wanderings put thou my tears into thy bottle are they not in thy book when i cry unto thee then shall mine enemies turn back this i know for god is for me in god will i praise his word in the lord will i praise his word in god have i put my trust i will not be afraid what man can do unto me thy vows are upon me o god i will render praises unto thee for thou hast delivered my soul from death wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling that i may walk before god in the light of the living be merciful unto me o god be merciful unto me for my soul trusteth in thee yea in the shadow of thy wings will i make my refuge until these calamities be overpast i will cry unto god most high unto god that performeth all things for me he shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up selah god shall send forth his mercy and his truth my soul is among lions and i lie even among them that are set on fire even the sons of men whose teeth are spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword be thou exalted o god above the heavens let thy glory be above all the earth they have prepared a net for my steps my soul is bowed down they have digged a pit before me into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves selah my heart is fixed o god my heart is fixed i will sing and give praise awake up my glory awake psaltery and harp i myself will awake early i will praise thee o lord among the people i will sing unto thee among the nations for thy mercy is great unto the heavens and thy truth unto the clouds be thou exalted o god above the heavens

earth the wicked are estranged from the womb they go astray as soon as they be born speaking lies their poison is like the poison of a serpent they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear which

continually when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows let them be as cut in pieces as a snail which melteth let every one of them pass away like the untimely birth of a woman that they may not see the sun before your pots can feel the thorns he shall take them away as with a whirlwind both living and in his wrath the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked so that a man shall say verily there is a reward for the righteous verily he is a god that judgeth in the earth deliver me from mine enemies o my god defend me from them that rise up against me deliver me from the workers of iniquity and save me from bloody men for lo they lie in wait for my soul the mighty are gathered against me not for my transgression nor for my sin o

desire upon mine enemies slay them not lest my people forget scatter them by thy power and bring them down o lord our shield for the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride and for cursing and lying which they speak consume them in wrath consume them that they may not be and let them know that god ruleth in jacob unto the ends of the earth selah and at evening let them return and let them make a noise like a dog and go round about the city let them wander up and down for meat and grudge if they be not satisfied but i will sing of thy power yea i will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble unto thee o my strength will i sing for god is my defence and the god of my mercy o god

over with corn they shout for joy they also sing make a joyful noise unto god all ye lands sing forth the honour of his name make his praise glorious say unto god how terrible art thou in thy works through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee all the earth shall worship thee and shall sing unto thee they shall sing to thy name selah come and see the works of god he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men he turned the sea into dry land they went through the flood on foot there did we rejoice in him he ruleth by his power for ever his eyes

that rideth upon the heavens by his name jah and rejoice before him a father of the fatherless and a judge of the widows is god in his holy habitation god setteth the solitary in families he bringeth

heavens also dropped at the presence of god even sinai itself was moved at the presence of god the god of israel thou o god didst send a plentiful rain whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance when it was weary thy congregation hath dwelt therein thou o god hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor the lord gave the word great was the company of those that published it kings of armies did flee apace and she that tarried at home divided the spoil though ye have lien among the pots yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver and her feathers with yellow gold when the almighty scattered kings in it it was white as snow in salmon the hill of god is as the hill of bashan an high hill as the hill of bashan why leap ye ye high hills this is the hill which god desireth to dwell in yea the lord will dwell in it for ever the chariots of god are twenty thousand even thousands of angels the lord is among them as in sinai in the holy place thou hast ascended on high thou

our salvation selah he that is our god is the god of salvation and unto god the lord belong the issues from death but god shall wound the head of his enemies and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses the lord said i will bring again from bashan i will bring my people again from the depths of the sea that thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies and the tongue of thy dogs in the same they have seen thy goings o god even the goings of my god my king in the sanctuary the singers went before the players on instruments followed after among them were the damsels playing with timbrels bless ye god in the congregations even the lord from the fountain of israel there is little benjamin with their ruler the princes of judah and their council the princes

the god of israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people blessed be god save me o god for the waters are come in unto my soul i sink in deep mire where there is no standing i am come into deep waters where the floods overflow me i am weary of my crying my throat is dried mine eyes fail while i wait for my god they that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head they that would destroy me being mine enemies wrongfully are mighty then i restored that which i took not away o god thou knowest my foolishness and my sins are not hid from thee let not them that wait on thee o lord god of hosts be ashamed for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake o god of israel because for thy sake i have borne reproach shame hath covered my face i am become a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my mother s children for the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me when i wept and chastened my soul with fasting that was to my reproach i made sackcloth also my garment and i became a proverb to them they that sit in the gate speak against me and i was the song of the drunkards but as for me my prayer is unto thee o lord in an acceptable time o god in the multitude of thy mercy hear me in the truth of thy salvation deliver me out of the mire and let me not sink let me be delivered from them that hate me and out of the deep waters let not the waterflood overflow me neither let the deep swallow me up and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me hear me o lord for thy lovingkindness is good turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies and hide not thy face from thy servant for i am in trouble hear me speedily draw nigh unto my soul and redeem it deliver me because of mine enemies thou hast known my reproach and my shame and my dishonour mine adversaries are all before thee reproach hath broken my heart and i am full of heaviness and i looked for some to take pity but there was none and for comforters but i found none they gave me also gall for my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink let their table become a snare before them and that which should have been for their welfare let it become a trap let their eyes be darkened that they see not and make their loins continually to shake pour out thine indignation upon them and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them let their habitation be desolate and let none dwell in their tents for they persecute him whom thou hast smitten and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded add iniquity unto their iniquity and let them not come into thy righteousness let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous but i am poor and sorrowful let thy salvation o god set me up on high i will praise the name of god with a song and will magnify him with thanksgiving this also shall please the lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs the humble shall see this and be glad and your heart shall live that seek god for the lord heareth the poor and despiseth not his prisoners let the heaven and earth praise him the seas and every thing that moveth therein for god will save zion and will build the cities of judah that they may dwell there and have it in possession the seed also of his servants shall inherit it and they that love his name shall dwell therein make haste o god to deliver me make haste to help me o lord let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul let them be turned backward and put to confusion that desire my hurt let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say aha aha let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee and let such as love thy salvation say continually let god be magnified but i am poor and needy make haste unto me o god thou art my help and my deliverer o lord make no tarrying in thee o lord do i put my trust let me never be put to confusion deliver me in thy righteousness and cause me to escape incline thine ear unto me and save me be thou my strong habitation whereunto i may continually resort thou hast given commandment to save me for thou art my rock and my fortress deliver me o my god out of the hand of the wicked out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man for thou art my hope o lord god thou art my trust from my youth by thee have i been holden up from the womb thou art he that took me out of my mother s bowels my praise shall be continually of thee i am as a wonder unto many but thou art my strong refuge let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day cast me not off in the time of old age forsake me not when my strength faileth for mine enemies speak against me and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together saying god hath forsaken him persecute and take him for there is none to deliver him o god be not far from me o my god make haste for my help let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt but i will hope continually and will yet praise thee more and more my mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day for i know not the numbers thereof i will go in the strength of the lord god i will make mention of thy righteousness even of thine only o god thou hast taught me from my youth and hitherto have i declared thy wondrous works now also when i am old and greyheaded o god forsake me not until i have shewed thy strength unto this generation and thy power to every one that is to come thy righteousness also o god is very high who hast done great things o god who is like unto thee thou which hast shewed me great and sore troubles shalt quicken me again and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth thou shalt increase my greatness and comfort me on every side i will also praise thee with the psaltery even thy truth o my god unto thee will i sing with the harp o thou holy one of israel my lips shall greatly rejoice when i sing unto thee and my soul which thou hast redeemed my tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long for they are confounded for they are brought unto shame that seek my hurt give the king thy judgments o god and thy righteousness unto the king s son he shall judge thy people with righteousness and thy poor with judgment the mountains shall bring peace to the people and the little hills by righteousness he shall judge the poor of the people he shall save the children of the needy and shall break in pieces the oppressor they shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure throughout all generations he shall come down like rain upon the mown grass as showers that water the earth in his days shall the righteous flourish and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth he shall have dominion also from sea to sea and from the river unto the ends of the earth they that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him and his enemies shall lick the dust the kings of tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents the kings of sheba and seba shall offer gifts yea all kings shall fall down before him all nations shall serve him for he shall deliver the needy when he crieth the poor also and him that hath no helper he shall spare the poor and needy and shall save the souls of the needy he shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence and precious shall their blood be in his sight and he shall live and to him shall be given of the gold of sheba prayer also shall be made for him continually and daily shall he be praised there shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains the fruit thereof shall shake like lebanon and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth his name shall endure for ever his name shall be continued as long as the sun and men shall be blessed in him all nations shall call him blessed blessed be the lord god the god of israel who only doeth wondrous things and blessed be his glorious name for ever and let the whole earth be filled with his glory amen and amen the prayers of david the son of jesse are ended truly god is good to israel even to such as are of a clean heart but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had well nigh slipped for i was envious at the foolish when i saw the prosperity of the wicked for there are no bands in their death but their strength is firm they are not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued like other men therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain violence covereth them as a garment their eyes stand out with fatness they have more than heart could wish they are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression they speak loftily they set their mouth against the heavens and their tongue walketh through the earth therefore his people return hither and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them and they say how doth god know and is there knowledge in the most high behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world they increase in riches verily i have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in innocency for all the day long have i been plagued and chastened every morning if i say i will speak thus behold i should offend against the generation of thy children when i thought to know this it was too painful for me until i went into the sanctuary of god then understood i their end surely thou didst set them in slippery places thou castedst them down into destruction how are they brought into desolation as in a moment they are utterly consumed with terrors as a dream when one awaketh so o lord when thou awakest thou shalt despise their image thus my heart was grieved and i was pricked in my reins so foolish was i and ignorant i was as a beast before thee nevertheless i am continually with thee thou hast holden me by my right hand thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to glory whom have i in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that i desire beside thee my flesh and my heart faileth but god is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever for lo they that are far from thee shall perish thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee but it is good for me to draw near to god i have put my trust in the lord god that i may declare all thy works o god why hast thou cast us off for ever why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture remember thy congregation which thou hast purchased of old the rod of thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed this mount zion wherein thou hast dwelt lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations they set up their ensigns for signs a man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees but now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers they have cast fire into thy sanctuary they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground they said in their hearts let us destroy them together they have burned up all the synagogues of god in the land we see not our signs there is no more any prophet neither is there among us any that knoweth how long o god how long shall the adversary reproach shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever why withdrawest thou thy hand even thy right hand pluck it out of thy bosom for god is my king of old working salvation in the midst of the earth thou didst divide the sea by thy strength thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood thou driedst up mighty rivers the day is thine the night also is thine thou hast prepared the light and the sun thou hast set all the borders of the earth thou hast made summer and winter remember this that the enemy hath reproached o lord and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name o deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever have respect unto the covenant for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty o let not the oppressed return ashamed let the poor and needy praise thy name arise o god plead thine own cause remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily forget not the voice of thine enemies the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually unto thee o god do we give thanks unto thee do we give thanks for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare when i shall receive the congregation i will judge uprightly the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved i bear up the pillars of it selah i said unto the fools deal not foolishly and to the wicked lift not up the horn lift not up your horn on high speak not with a stiff neck for promotion cometh neither from the east nor from the west nor from the south but god is the judge he putteth down one and setteth up another for in the hand of the lord there is a cup and the wine is red it is full of mixture and he poureth out of the same but the dregs thereof all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out and drink them but i will declare for ever i will sing praises to the god of jacob all the horns of the wicked also will i cut off but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted in judah is god known his name is great in israel in salem also is his tabernacle and his dwelling place in zion there brake he the arrows of the bow the shield and the sword and the battle selah thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey the stouthearted are spoiled they have slept their sleep and none of the men of might have found their hands at thy rebuke o god of jacob both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep thou even thou art to be feared and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven the earth feared and was still when god arose to judgment to save all the meek of the earth selah surely the wrath of man shall praise thee the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain vow and pay unto the lord your god let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared he shall cut off the spirit of princes he is terrible to the kings of the earth i cried unto god with my voice even unto god with my voice and he gave ear unto me in the day of my trouble i sought the lord my sore ran in the night and ceased not my soul refused to be comforted i remembered god and was troubled i complained and my spirit was overwhelmed selah thou holdest mine eyes waking i am so troubled that i cannot speak i have considered the days of old the years of ancient times i call to remembrance my song in the night i commune with mine own heart and my spirit made diligent search will the lord cast off for ever and will he be favourable no more is his mercy clean gone for ever doth his promise fail for evermore hath god forgotten to be gracious hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies selah and i said this is my infirmity but i will remember the years of the right hand of the most high i will remember the works of the lord surely i will remember thy wonders of old i will meditate also of all thy work and talk of thy doings thy way o god is in the sanctuary who is so great a god as our god thou art the god that doest wonders thou hast declared thy strength among the people thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people the sons of jacob and joseph selah the waters saw thee o god the waters saw thee they were afraid the depths also were troubled the clouds poured out water the skies sent out a sound thine arrows also went abroad the voice of thy thunder was in the heaven the lightnings lightened the world the earth trembled and shook thy way is in the sea and thy path in the great waters and thy footsteps are not known thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of moses and aaron give ear o my people to my law incline your ears to the words of my mouth i will open my mouth in a parable i will utter dark sayings of old which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us we will not hide them from their children shewing to the generation to come the praises of the lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he hath done for he established a testimony in jacob and appointed a law in israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children that the generation to come might know them even the children which should be born who should arise and declare them to their children that they might set their hope in god and not forget the works of god but keep his commandments and might not be as their fathers a stubborn and rebellious generation a generation that set not their heart aright and whose spirit was not stedfast with god the children of ephraim being armed and carrying bows turned back in the day of battle they kept not the covenant of god and refused to walk in his law and forgat his works and his wonders that he had shewed them marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers in the land of egypt in the field of zoan he divided the sea and caused them to pass through and he made the waters to stand as an heap in the daytime also he led them with a cloud and all the night with a light of fire he clave the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as out of the great depths he brought streams also out of the rock and caused waters to run down like rivers and they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most high in the wilderness and they tempted god in their heart by asking meat for their lust yea they spake against god they said can god furnish a table in the wilderness behold he smote the rock that the waters gushed out and the streams overflowed can he give bread also can he provide flesh for his people therefore the lord heard this and was wroth so a fire was kindled against jacob and anger also came up against israel because they believed not in god and trusted not in his salvation though he had commanded the clouds from above and opened the doors of heaven and had rained down manna upon them to eat and had given them of the corn of heaven man did eat angels food he sent them meat to the full he caused an east wind to blow in the heaven and by his power he brought in the south wind he rained flesh also upon them as dust and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea and he let it fall in the midst of their camp round about their habitations so they did eat and were well filled for he gave them their own desire they were not estranged from their lust but while their meat was yet in their mouths the wrath of god came upon them and slew the fattest of them and smote down the chosen men of israel for all this they sinned still and believed not for his wondrous works therefore their days did he consume in vanity and their years in trouble when he slew them then they sought him and they returned and enquired early after god and they remembered that god was their rock and the high god their redeemer nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth and they lied unto him with their tongues for their heart was not right with him neither were they stedfast in his covenant but he being full of compassion forgave their iniquity and destroyed them not yea many a time turned he his anger away and did not stir up all his wrath for he remembered that they were but flesh a wind that passeth away and cometh not again how oft did they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desert yea they turned back and tempted god and limited the holy one of israel they remembered not his hand nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy how he had wrought his signs in egypt and his wonders in the field of zoan and had turned their rivers into blood and their floods that they could not drink he sent divers sorts of flies among them which devoured them and frogs which destroyed them he gave also their increase unto the caterpiller and their labour unto the locust he destroyed their vines with hail and their sycomore trees with frost he gave up their cattle also to the hail and their flocks to hot thunderbolts he cast upon them the fierceness of his anger wrath and indignation and trouble by sending evil angels among them he made a way to his anger he spared not their soul from death but gave their life over to the pestilence and smote all the firstborn in egypt the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of ham but made his own people to go forth like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock and he led them on safely so that they feared not but the sea overwhelmed their enemies and he brought them to the border of his sanctuary even to this mountain which his right hand had purchased he cast out the heathen also before them and divided them an inheritance by line and made the tribes of israel to dwell in their tents yet they tempted and provoked the most high god and kept not his testimonies but turned back and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers they were turned aside like a deceitful bow for they provoked him to anger with their high places and moved him to jealousy with their graven images when god heard this he was wroth and greatly abhorred israel so that he forsook the tabernacle of shiloh the tent which he placed among men and delivered his strength into captivity and his glory into the enemy s hand he gave his people over also unto the sword and was wroth with his inheritance the fire consumed their young men and their maidens were not given to marriage their priests fell by the sword and their widows made no lamentation then the lord awaked as one out of sleep and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine and he smote his enemies in the hinder parts he put them to a perpetual reproach moreover he refused the tabernacle of joseph and chose not the tribe of ephraim but chose the tribe of judah the mount zion which he loved and he built his sanctuary like high palaces like the earth which he hath established for ever he chose david also his servant and took him from the sheepfolds from following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed jacob his people and israel his inheritance so he fed them according to the integrity of his heart and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands o god the heathen are come into thine inheritance thy holy temple have they defiled they have laid jerusalem on heaps the dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth their blood have they shed like water round about jerusalem and there was none to bury them we are become a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and derision to them that are round about us how long lord wilt thou be angry for ever shall thy jealousy burn like fire pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name for they have devoured jacob and laid waste his dwelling place o remember not against us former iniquities let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us for we are brought very low help us o god of our salvation for the glory of thy name and deliver us and purge away our sins for thy name s sake wherefore should the heathen say where is their god let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die and render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach wherewith they have reproached thee o lord so we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever we will shew forth thy praise to all generations give ear o shepherd of israel thou that leadest joseph like a flock thou that dwellest between the cherubims shine forth before ephraim and benjamin and manasseh stir up thy strength and come and save us turn us again o god and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved o lord god of hosts how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people thou feedest them with the bread of tears and givest them tears to drink in great measure thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours and our enemies laugh among themselves turn us again o god of hosts and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved thou hast brought a vine out of egypt thou hast cast out the heathen and planted it thou preparedst room before it and didst cause it to take deep root and it filled the land the hills were covered with the shadow of it and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars she sent out her boughs unto the sea and her branches unto the river why hast thou then broken down her hedges so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her the boar out of the wood doth waste it and the wild beast of the field doth devour it return we beseech thee o god of hosts look down from heaven and behold and visit this vine and the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself it is burned with fire it is cut down they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself so will not we go back from thee quicken us and we will call upon thy name turn us again o lord god of hosts cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved sing aloud unto god our strength make a joyful noise unto the god of jacob take a psalm and bring hither the timbrel the pleasant harp with the psaltery blow up the trumpet in the new moon in the time appointed on our solemn feast day for this was a statute for israel and a law of the god of jacob this he ordained in joseph for a testimony when he went out through the land of egypt where i heard a language that i understood not i removed his shoulder from the burden his hands were delivered from the pots thou calledst in trouble and i delivered thee i answered thee in the secret place of thunder i proved thee at the waters of meribah selah hear o my people and i will testify unto thee o israel if thou wilt hearken unto me there shall no strange god be in thee neither shalt thou worship any strange god i am the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt open thy mouth wide and i will fill it but my people would not hearken to my voice and israel would none of me so i gave them up unto their own hearts lust and they walked in their own counsels oh that my people had hearkened unto me and israel had walked in my ways i should soon have subdued their enemies and turned my hand against their adversaries the haters of the lord should have submitted themselves unto him but their time should have endured for ever he should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat and with honey out of the rock should i have satisfied thee god standeth in the congregation of the mighty he judgeth among the gods how long will ye judge unjustly and accept the persons of the wicked selah defend the poor and fatherless do justice to the afflicted and needy deliver the poor and needy rid them out of the hand of the wicked they know not neither will they understand they walk on in darkness all the foundations of the earth are out of course i have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high but ye shall die like men and fall like one of the princes arise o god judge the earth for thou shalt inherit all nations keep not thou silence o god hold not thy peace and be not still o god for lo thine enemies make a tumult and they that hate thee have lifted up the head they have taken crafty counsel against thy people and consulted against thy hidden ones they have said come and let us cut them off from being a nation that the name of israel may be no more in remembrance for they have consulted together with one consent they are confederate against thee the tabernacles of edom and the ishmaelites of moab and the hagarenes gebal and ammon and amalek the philistines with the inhabitants of tyre assur also is joined with them they have holpen the children of lot selah do unto them as unto the midianites as to sisera as to jabin at the brook of kison which perished at endor they became as dung for the earth make their nobles like oreb and like zeeb yea all their princes as zebah and as zalmunna who said let us take to ourselves the houses of god in possession o my god make them like a wheel as the stubble before the wind as the fire burneth a wood and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire so persecute them with thy tempest and make them afraid with thy storm fill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name o lord let them be confounded and troubled for ever yea let them be put to shame and perish that men may know that thou whose name alone is jehovah art the most high over all the earth how amiable are thy tabernacles o lord of hosts my soul longeth yea even fainteth for the courts of the lord my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living god yea the sparrow hath found an house and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young even thine altars o lord of hosts my king and my god blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still praising thee selah blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are the ways

wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness

reward of the wicked because thou hast made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against a stone thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet because he hath set his love upon me therefore will i deliver him i will set him on high because he hath known my name he shall call upon me and i will answer him i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honour him with long life will i satisfy him and shew him my salvation it is a good thing to give thanks unto the lord and to sing praises unto thy name o most high to shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning and thy faithfulness every night upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the psaltery upon the harp with a solemn sound for thou lord hast made me glad through thy work i will triumph in the works of thy hands o lord how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep a brutish man knoweth not neither doth a fool understand

be planted in the house of the lord shall flourish in the courts of our god they shall still bring forth fruit in old age they shall be fat and flourishing to shew that the lord is upright he is my rock and there is no unrighteousness in him the lord reigneth he is clothed with majesty the lord is clothed with strength wherewith he hath girded himself the world also is stablished that it cannot be moved thy throne is established of old thou art from everlasting the floods have lifted up o lord the floods have lifted up their voice the floods lift up their waves the lord on high is mightier

vengeance belongeth shew thyself lift up thyself thou judge of the earth render a reward to the proud lord how long shall the wicked how long shall the wicked triumph how long shall they utter and speak hard things and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves they break in pieces thy people o lord and afflict thine heritage they slay the widow and the stranger and murder the fatherless yet they say the lord shall not see neither shall the god of jacob regard it understand ye brutish among the people and ye fools when will ye be wise he that planted the ear shall he not hear he that formed the eye shall he not see he that chastiseth the heathen shall not he correct he that teacheth man knowledge shall not he know the lord knoweth the thoughts of man that they are vanity blessed is the man whom thou chastenest o lord and teachest him out of thy law that thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity until the pit be digged for the wicked for the lord will not cast off his people neither will he forsake his inheritance but judgment shall return unto righteousness and all the upright in heart shall follow it who will rise up for me against the evildoers or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity unless the lord had been my help my soul had almost dwelt in silence when i said my foot slippeth thy mercy o lord held me up in the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee which frameth mischief by a law they gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous

face evermore remember his marvellous works that he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth o ye seed of abraham his servant ye children of jacob his chosen he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth he hath remembered his covenant for ever the word which he commanded to a thousand generations which covenant he made with abraham and his oath unto isaac and confirmed the same unto jacob for a law and to israel for an everlasting covenant saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance when they were but a few men in number yea very few and strangers in it when they went from one nation to another from one kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for their sakes saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm moreover he called for a famine upon the land he brake the whole staff of bread he sent a man before them even joseph who was sold for a servant whose feet they hurt with fetters he was laid in iron until the time that his word came the word of the lord tried him the king sent and loosed him even the ruler of the people and let him go free he made him lord of his house and ruler of all his substance to bind his princes at his pleasure and teach his senators wisdom israel also came into egypt and jacob sojourned in the land of ham and he increased his people greatly and made them stronger than their enemies he turned their heart to hate his people to deal subtilly with his servants he sent moses his servant and aaron whom he had chosen they shewed his signs among them and wonders in the land of ham he sent darkness and made it dark and they rebelled not against his word he turned their waters into blood and slew their fish their land brought forth frogs in abundance in the chambers of their kings he spake and there came divers sorts of flies and lice in all their coasts he gave them hail for rain and flaming fire in their land he smote their vines also and their fig trees and brake the trees of their coasts he spake and the locusts came and caterpillers and that without number and did eat up all the herbs in their land and devoured the fruit of their ground he smote also all the firstborn in their land the chief of all their strength he brought them forth also with silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribes egypt was glad when they departed for the fear of them fell upon them he spread a cloud for a covering and fire to give light in the night the people asked and he brought quails and satisfied them with the bread of heaven he opened the rock and the waters gushed out they ran in the dry places like a river for he remembered his holy promise and abraham his servant and he brought forth his people with joy and his chosen with gladness and gave them the lands of the heathen and they inherited the labour of the people that they might observe his statutes and keep his laws praise ye the lord praise ye the lord o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever who can utter the mighty acts of the lord who can shew forth all his praise blessed are they that keep judgment and he that doeth righteousness at all times remember me o lord with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people o visit me with thy salvation that i may see the good of thy chosen that i may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation that i may glory with thine inheritance we have sinned with our fathers we have committed iniquity we have done wickedly our fathers understood not thy wonders in egypt they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the sea even at the red sea nevertheless he saved them for his name s sake that he might make his mighty power to be known he rebuked the red sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the depths as through the wilderness and he saved them from the hand of him that hated them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy and the waters covered their enemies there was not one of them left then believed they his words they sang his praise they soon forgat his works they waited not for his counsel but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted god in the desert and he gave them their request but sent leanness into their soul they envied moses also in the camp and aaron the saint of the lord the earth opened and swallowed up dathan and covered the company of abiram and a fire was kindled in their company the flame burned up the wicked they made a calf in horeb and worshipped the molten image thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass they forgat god their saviour which had done great things in egypt wondrous works in the land of ham and terrible things by the red sea therefore he said that he would destroy them had not moses his chosen stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath lest he should destroy them yea they despised the pleasant land they believed not his word but murmured in their tents and hearkened not unto the voice of the lord therefore he lifted up his hand against them to overthrow them in the wilderness to overthrow their seed also among the nations and to scatter them in the lands they joined themselves also unto baalpeor and ate the sacrifices of the dead thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions and the plague brake in upon them then stood up phinehas and executed judgment and so the plague was stayed and that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore they angered him also at the waters of strife so that it went ill with moses for their sakes because they provoked his spirit so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips they did not destroy the nations concerning whom the lord commanded them but were mingled among the heathen and learned their works and they served their idols which were a snare unto them yea they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils and shed innocent blood even the blood of their sons and of their daughters whom they sacrificed unto the idols of canaan and the land was polluted with blood thus were they defiled with their own works and went a whoring with their own inventions therefore was the wrath of the lord kindled against his people insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance and he gave them into the hand of the heathen and they that hated them ruled over them their enemies also oppressed them and they were brought into subjection under their hand many times did he deliver them but they provoked him with their counsel and were brought low for their iniquity nevertheless he regarded their affliction when he heard their cry and he remembered for them his covenant and repented according to the multitude of his mercies he made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives save us o lord our god and gather us from among the heathen to give thanks unto thy holy name and to triumph in thy praise blessed be the lord god of israel from everlasting to everlasting and let all the people say amen praise ye the lord o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever let the redeemed of the lord say so whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy and gathered them out of the lands from the east and from the west from the north and from the south they wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way they found no city to dwell in hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distresses and he led them forth by the right way that they might go to a city of habitation oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men for he satisfieth the longing soul and filleth the hungry soul with goodness such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death being bound in affliction and iron because they rebelled against the words of god and contemned the counsel of the most high therefore he brought down their heart with labour they fell down and there was none to help then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he saved them out of their distresses he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and brake their bands in sunder oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men for he hath broken the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron in sunder fools because of their transgression and because of their iniquities are afflicted their soul abhorreth all manner of meat and they draw near unto the gates of death then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing they that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great waters these see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifteth up the waves thereof they mount up to the heaven they go down again to the depths their soul is melted because of trouble they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wit s end then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distresses he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still then are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired haven oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people and praise him in the assembly of the elders he turneth rivers into a wilderness and the watersprings into dry ground a fruitful land into barrenness for the wickedness of them that dwell therein he turneth the wilderness into a standing water and dry ground into watersprings and there he maketh the hungry to dwell that they may prepare a city for habitation and sow the fields and plant vineyards which may yield fruits of increase he blesseth them also so that they are multiplied greatly and suffereth not their cattle to decrease again they are minished and brought low through oppression affliction and sorrow he poureth contempt upon princes and causeth them to wander in the wilderness where there is no way yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction and maketh him families like a flock the righteous shall see it and rejoice and all iniquity shall stop her mouth whoso is wise and will observe these things even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the lord o god my heart is fixed i will sing and give praise even with my glory awake psaltery and harp i myself will awake early i will praise thee o lord among the people and i will sing praises unto thee among the nations for thy mercy is great above the heavens and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds be thou exalted o god above the heavens and thy glory

spoken against me with a lying tongue they compassed me about also with words of hatred and fought against me without a cause for my love they are my adversaries but i give myself unto prayer and they have rewarded me evil for good and hatred for my love set thou a wicked man over him and let satan stand at his right hand when he shall be judged let him be condemned and let his prayer become sin let his days be few and let another take his office let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow let his children be continually vagabonds and beg let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places let the extortioner catch all that he hath and let the strangers spoil his labour let there be none to extend mercy unto him neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children let his posterity be cut off and in the generation following let their name be blotted out let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the lord and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out let them be before the lord continually that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth because that he remembered not to shew mercy but persecuted the poor and needy man that he might even slay the broken in heart as he loved cursing so let it come unto him as he delighted not in blessing so let it be far from him as he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment so let it come into his bowels like water and like oil into his bones let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the lord and of them that speak evil against my soul but do thou for me o god the lord for thy name s sake because thy mercy is good deliver thou me for i am poor and needy and my heart is wounded within me i am gone like the shadow when it declineth i am tossed up and down as the locust my knees are weak through fasting and my flesh faileth of fatness i became also a reproach

day of thy power in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning thou hast the dew of thy youth the lord hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of

rest upon the lot of the righteous lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity do good o lord unto those that be good and to them that are upright in their hearts as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways the lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity but peace shall be upon israel when the lord turned again the captivity of zion we were like them that dream then
