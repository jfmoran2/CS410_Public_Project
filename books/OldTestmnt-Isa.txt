the vision of isaiah the son of amoz which he saw concerning judah and jerusalem in the days of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah hear o heavens and give ear o earth for the lord hath spoken i have nourished and brought up children and they have rebelled against me the ox knoweth his owner and the ass his master s crib but israel doth not know my people doth not consider ah sinful nation a people laden with iniquity a seed of evildoers children that are corrupters they have forsaken the lord they have provoked the holy one of israel unto anger they are gone away backward why should ye be stricken any more ye will revolt more and more the whole head is sick and the whole heart faint from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it but wounds and bruises and putrifying sores they have not been closed neither bound up neither mollified with ointment your country is desolate your cities are burned with fire your land strangers devour it in your presence and it is desolate as overthrown by strangers and the daughter of zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers as a besieged city except the lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant we should have been as sodom and we should have been like unto gomorrah hear the word of the lord ye rulers of sodom give ear unto the law of our god ye people of gomorrah to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me saith the lord i am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts and i delight not in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of he goats when ye come to appear before me who hath required this at your hand to tread my courts bring no more vain oblations incense is an abomination unto me the new moons and sabbaths the calling of assemblies i cannot away with it is iniquity even the solemn meeting your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth they are a trouble unto me i am weary to bear them and when ye spread forth your hands i will hide mine eyes from you yea when ye make many prayers i will not hear your hands are full of blood wash you make you clean put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes cease to do evil learn to do well seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the widow come now and let us reason together saith the lord though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool if ye be willing and obedient ye shall eat the good of the land but if ye refuse and rebel ye shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it how is the faithful city become an harlot it was full of judgment righteousness lodged in it but now murderers thy silver is become dross thy wine mixed with water thy princes are rebellious and companions of thieves every one loveth gifts and followeth after rewards they judge not the fatherless neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them therefore saith the lord the lord of hosts the mighty one of israel ah i will ease me of mine adversaries and avenge me of mine enemies and i will turn my hand upon thee and purely purge away thy dross and take away all thy tin and i will restore thy judges as at the first and thy counsellors as at the beginning afterward thou shalt be called the city of righteousness the faithful city zion shall be redeemed with judgment and her converts with righteousness and the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together and they that forsake the lord shall be consumed for they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen for ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth and as a garden that hath no water and the strong shall be as tow and the maker of it as a spark and they shall both burn together and none shall quench them the word that isaiah the son of amoz saw concerning judah and jerusalem and it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the lord s house shall be established in the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills and all nations shall flow unto it and many people shall go and say come ye and let us go up to the mountain of the lord to the house of the god of jacob and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths for out of zion shall go forth the law and the word of the lord from jerusalem and he shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more o house of jacob come ye and let us walk in the light of the lord therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of jacob because they be replenished from the east and are soothsayers like the philistines and they please themselves in the children of strangers their land also is full of silver and gold neither is there any end of their treasures their land is also full of horses neither is there any end of their chariots their land also is full of idols they worship the work of their own hands that which their own fingers have made and the mean man boweth down and the great man humbleth himself therefore forgive them not enter into the rock and hide thee in the dust for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty the lofty looks of man shall be humbled and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down and the lord alone shall be exalted in that day for the day of the lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty and upon every one that is lifted up and he shall be brought low and upon all the cedars of lebanon that are high and lifted up and upon all the oaks of bashan and upon all the high mountains and upon all the hills that are lifted up and upon every high tower and upon every fenced wall and upon all the ships of tarshish and upon all pleasant pictures and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down and the haughtiness of men shall be made low and the lord alone shall be exalted in that day and the idols he shall utterly abolish and they shall go into the holes of the rocks and into the caves of the earth for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth in that day a man shall cast his idols of silver and his idols of gold which they made each one for himself to worship to the moles and to the bats to go into the clefts of the rocks and into the tops of the ragged rocks for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth cease ye from man whose breath is in his nostrils for wherein is he to be accounted of for behold the lord the lord of hosts doth take away from jerusalem and from judah the stay and the staff the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water the mighty man and the man of war the judge and the prophet and the prudent and the ancient the captain of fifty and the honourable man and the counsellor and the cunning artificer and the eloquent orator and i will give children to be their princes and babes shall rule over them and the people shall be oppressed every one by another and every one by his neighbour the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient and the base against the honourable when a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father saying thou hast clothing be thou our ruler and let this ruin be under thy hand in that day shall he swear saying i will not be an healer for in my house is neither bread nor clothing make me not a ruler of the people for jerusalem is ruined and judah is fallen because their tongue and their doings are against the lord to provoke the eyes of his glory the shew of their countenance doth witness against them and they declare their sin as sodom they hide it not woe unto their soul for they have rewarded evil unto themselves say ye to the righteous that it shall be well with him for they shall eat the fruit of their doings woe unto the wicked it shall be ill with him for the reward of his hands shall be given him as for my people children are their oppressors and women rule over them o my people they which lead thee cause thee to err and destroy the way of thy paths the lord standeth up to plead and standeth to judge the people the lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people and the princes thereof for ye have eaten up the vineyard the spoil of the poor is in your houses what mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces and grind the faces of the poor saith the lord god of hosts moreover the lord saith because the daughters of zion are haughty and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes walking and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet therefore the lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of zion and the lord will discover their secret parts in that day the lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet and their cauls and their round tires like the moon the chains and the bracelets and the mufflers the bonnets and the ornaments of the legs and the headbands and the tablets and the earrings the rings and nose jewels the changeable suits of apparel and the mantles and the wimples and the crisping pins the glasses and the fine linen and the hoods and the vails and it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink and instead of a girdle a rent and instead of well set hair baldness and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth and burning instead of beauty thy men shall fall by the sword and thy mighty in the war and her gates shall lament and mourn and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of israel and it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion and he that remaineth in jerusalem shall be called holy even every one that is written among the living in jerusalem when the lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of zion and shall have purged the blood of jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning and the lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount zion and upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defence and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the heat and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain now will i sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard my wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill and he fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof and planted it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and also made a winepress therein and he looked that it should bring forth grapes and it brought forth wild grapes and now o inhabitants of jerusalem and men of judah judge i pray you betwixt me and my vineyard what could have been done more to my vineyard that i have not done in it wherefore when i looked that it should bring forth grapes brought it forth wild grapes and now go to i will tell you what i will do to my vineyard i will take away the hedge thereof and it shall be eaten up and break down the wall thereof and it shall be trodden down and i will lay it waste it shall not be pruned nor digged but there shall come up briers and thorns i will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it for the vineyard of the lord of hosts is the house of israel and the men of judah his pleasant plant and he looked for judgment but behold oppression for righteousness but behold a cry woe unto them that join house to house that lay field to field till there be no place that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth in mine ears said the lord of hosts of a truth many houses shall be desolate even great and fair without inhabitant yea ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink that continue until night till wine inflame them and the harp and the viol the tabret and pipe and wine are in their feasts but they regard not the work of the lord neither consider the operation of his hands therefore my people are gone into captivity because they have no knowledge and their honourable men are famished and their multitude dried up with thirst therefore hell hath enlarged herself and opened her mouth without measure and their glory and their multitude and their pomp and he that rejoiceth shall descend into it and the mean man shall be brought down and the mighty man shall be humbled and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled but the lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment and god that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness then shall the lambs feed after their manner and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity and sin as it were with a cart rope that say let him make speed and hasten his work that we may see it and let the counsel of the holy one of israel draw nigh and come that we may know it woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink which justify the wicked for reward and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble and the flame consumeth the chaff so their root shall be as rottenness and their blossom shall go up as dust because they have cast away the law of the lord of hosts and despised the word of the holy one of israel therefore is the anger of the lord kindled against his people and he hath stretched forth his hand against them and hath smitten them and the hills did tremble and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still and he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth and behold they shall come with speed swiftly none shall be weary nor stumble among them none shall slumber nor sleep neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed nor the latchet of their shoes be broken whose arrows are sharp and all their bows bent their horses hoofs shall be counted like flint and their wheels like a whirlwind their roaring shall be like a lion they shall roar like young lions yea they shall roar and lay hold of the prey and shall carry it away safe and none shall deliver it and in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea and if one look unto the land behold darkness and sorrow and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said i woe is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged also i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send and who will go for us then said i here am i send me and he said go and tell this people hear ye indeed but understand not and see ye indeed but perceive not make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and convert and be healed then said i lord how long and he answered until the cities be wasted without inhabitant and the houses without man and the land be utterly desolate and the lord have removed men far away and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land but yet in it shall be a tenth and it shall return and shall be eaten as a teil tree and as an oak whose substance is in them when they cast their leaves so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof and it came to pass in the days of ahaz the son of jotham the son of uzziah king of judah that rezin the king of syria and pekah the son of remaliah king of israel went up toward jerusalem to war against it but could not prevail against it and it was told the house of david saying syria is confederate with ephraim and his heart was moved and the heart of his people as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind then said the lord unto isaiah go forth now to meet ahaz thou and shearjashub thy son at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller s field and say unto him take heed and be quiet fear not neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands for the fierce anger of rezin with syria and of the son of remaliah because syria ephraim and the son of remaliah have taken evil counsel against thee saying let us go up against judah and vex it and let us make a breach therein for us and set a king in the midst of it even the son of tabeal thus saith the lord god it shall not stand neither shall it come to pass for the head of syria is damascus and the head of damascus is rezin and within threescore and five years shall ephraim be broken that it be not a people and the head of ephraim is samaria and the head of samaria is remaliah s son if ye will not believe surely ye shall not be established moreover the lord spake again unto ahaz saying ask thee a sign of the lord thy god ask it either in the depth or in the height above but ahaz said i will not ask neither will i tempt the lord and he said hear ye now o house of david is it a small thing for you to weary men but will ye weary my god also therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name immanuel butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good for before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings the lord shall bring upon thee and upon thy people and upon thy father s house days that have not come from the day that ephraim departed from judah even the king of assyria and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of egypt and for the bee that is in the land of assyria and they shall come and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys and in the holes of the rocks and upon all thorns and upon all bushes in the same day shall the lord shave with a razor that is hired namely by them beyond the river by the king of assyria the head and the hair of the feet and it shall also consume the beard and it shall come to pass in that day that a man shall nourish a young cow and two sheep and it shall come to pass for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land and it shall come to pass in that day that every place shall be where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings it shall even be for briers and thorns with arrows and with bows shall men come thither because all the land shall become briers and thorns and on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen and for the treading of lesser cattle moreover the lord said unto me take thee a great roll and write in it with a man s pen concerning mahershalalhashbaz and i took unto me faithful witnesses to record uriah the priest and zechariah the son of jeberechiah and i went unto the prophetess and she conceived and bare a son then said the lord to me call his name mahershalalhashbaz for before the child shall have knowledge to cry my father and my mother the riches of damascus and the spoil of samaria shall be taken away before the king of assyria the lord spake also unto me again saying forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of shiloah that go softly and rejoice in rezin and remaliah s son now therefore behold the lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river strong and many even the king of assyria and all his glory and he shall come up over all his channels and go over all his banks and he shall pass through judah he shall overflow and go over he shall reach even to the neck and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land o immanuel associate yourselves o ye people and ye shall be broken in pieces and give ear all ye of far countries gird yourselves and ye shall be broken in pieces gird yourselves and ye shall be broken in pieces take counsel together and it shall come to nought speak the word and it shall not stand for god is with us for the lord spake thus to me with a strong hand and instructed me that i should not walk in the way of this people saying say ye not a confederacy to all them to whom this people shall say a confederacy neither fear ye their fear nor be afraid sanctify the lord of hosts himself and let him be your fear and let him be your dread and he shall be for a sanctuary but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of israel for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of jerusalem and many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken and be snared and be taken bind up the testimony seal the law among my disciples and i will wait upon the lord that hideth his face from the house of jacob and i will look for him behold i and the children whom the lord hath given me are for signs and for wonders in israel from the lord of hosts which dwelleth in mount zion and when they shall say unto you seek unto them that have familiar spirits and unto wizards that peep and that mutter should not a people seek unto their god for the living to the dead to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in them and they shall pass through it hardly bestead and hungry and it shall come to pass that when they shall be hungry they shall fret themselves and curse their king and their god and look upward and they shall look unto the earth and behold trouble and darkness dimness of anguish and they shall be driven to darkness nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea beyond jordan in galilee of the nations the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shined thou hast multiplied the nation and not increased the joy they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil for thou hast broken the yoke of his burden and the staff of his shoulder the rod of his oppressor as in the day of midian for every battle of the warrior is with confused noise and garments rolled in blood but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this the lord sent a word into jacob and it hath lighted upon israel and all the people shall know even ephraim and the inhabitant of samaria that say in the pride and stoutness of heart the bricks are fallen down but we will build with hewn stones the sycomores are cut down but we will change them into cedars therefore the lord shall set up the adversaries of rezin against him and join his enemies together the syrians before and the philistines behind and they shall devour israel with open mouth for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still for the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them neither do they seek the lord of hosts therefore the lord will cut off from israel head and tail branch and rush in one day the ancient and honourable he is the head and the prophet that teacheth lies he is the tail for the leaders of this people cause them to err and they that are led of them are destroyed therefore the lord shall have no joy in their young men neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows for every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer and every mouth speaketh folly for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still for wickedness burneth as the fire it shall devour the briers and thorns and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke through the wrath of the lord of hosts is the land darkened and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire no man shall spare his brother and he shall snatch on the right hand and be hungry and he shall eat on the left hand and they shall not be satisfied they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm manasseh ephraim and ephraim manasseh and they together shall be against judah for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees and that write grievousness which they have prescribed to turn aside the needy from judgment and to take away the right from the poor of my people that widows may be their prey and that they may rob the fatherless and what will ye do in the day of visitation and in the desolation which shall come from far to whom will ye flee for help and where will ye leave your glory without me they shall bow down under the prisoners and they shall fall under the slain for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still o assyrian the rod of mine anger and the staff in their hand is mine indignation i will send him against an hypocritical nation and against the people of my wrath will i give him a charge to take the spoil and to take the prey and to tread them down like the mire of the streets howbeit he meaneth not so neither doth his heart think so but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few for he saith are not my princes altogether kings is not calno as carchemish is not hamath as arpad is not samaria as damascus as my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols and whose graven images did excel them of jerusalem and of samaria shall i not as i have done unto samaria and her idols so do to jerusalem and her idols wherefore it shall come to pass that when the lord hath performed his whole work upon mount zion and on jerusalem i will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of assyria and the glory of his high looks for he saith by the strength of my hand i have done it and by my wisdom for i am prudent and i have removed the bounds of the people and have robbed their treasures and i have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people and as one gathereth eggs that are left have i gathered all the earth and there was none that moved the wing or opened the mouth or peeped shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up or as if the staff should lift up itself as if it were no wood therefore shall the lord the lord of hosts send among his fat ones leanness and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire and the light of israel shall be for a fire and his holy one for a flame and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day and shall consume the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field both soul and body and they shall be as when a standard bearer fainteth and the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few that a child may write them and it shall come to pass in that day that the remnant of israel and such as are escaped of the house of jacob shall no more again stay upon him that smote them but shall stay upon the lord the holy one of israel in truth the remnant shall return even the remnant of jacob unto the mighty god for though thy people israel be as the sand of the sea yet a remnant of them shall return the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness for the lord god of hosts shall make a consumption even determined in the midst of all the land therefore thus saith the lord god of hosts o my people that dwellest in zion be not afraid of the assyrian he shall smite thee with a rod and shall lift up his staff against thee after the manner of egypt for yet a very little while and the indignation shall cease and mine anger in their destruction and the lord of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of midian at the rock of oreb and as his rod was upon the sea so shall he lift it up after the manner of egypt and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing he is come to aiath he is passed to migron at michmash he hath laid up his carriages they are gone over the passage they have taken up their lodging at geba ramah is afraid gibeah of saul is fled lift up thy voice o daughter of gallim cause it to be heard unto laish o poor anathoth madmenah is removed the inhabitants of gebim gather themselves to flee as yet shall he remain at nob that day he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of zion the hill of jerusalem behold the lord the lord of hosts shall lop the bough with terror and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down and the haughty shall be humbled and he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron and lebanon shall fall by a mighty one and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots and the spirit of the lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the lord and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his ears but with righteousness shall he judge the poor and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked and righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins and faithfulness the girdle of his reins the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them and the cow and the bear shall feed their young ones shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox and the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice den they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea and in that day there shall be a root of jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people to it shall the gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people which shall be left from assyria and from egypt and from pathros and from cush and from elam and from shinar and from hamath and from the islands of the sea and he shall set up an ensign for the nations and shall assemble the outcasts of israel and gather together the dispersed of judah from the four corners of the earth the envy also of ephraim shall depart and the adversaries of judah shall be cut off ephraim shall not envy judah and judah shall not vex ephraim but they shall fly upon the shoulders of the philistines toward the west they shall spoil them of the east together they shall lay their hand upon edom and moab and the children of ammon shall obey them and the lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the egyptian sea and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river and shall smite it in the seven streams and make men go over dryshod and there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people which shall be left from assyria like as it was to israel in the day that he came up out of the land of egypt and in that day thou shalt say o lord i will praise thee though thou wast angry with me thine anger is turned away and thou comfortedst me behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my song he also is become my salvation therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation and in that day shall ye say praise the lord call upon his name declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exalted sing unto the lord for he hath done excellent things this is known in all the earth cry out and shout thou inhabitant of zion for great is the holy one of israel in the midst of thee the burden of babylon which isaiah the son of amoz did see lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain exalt the voice unto them shake the hand that they may go into the gates of the nobles i have commanded my sanctified ones i have also called my mighty ones for mine anger even them that rejoice in my highness the noise of a multitude in the mountains like as of a great people a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together the lord of hosts mustereth the host of the battle they come from a far country from the end of heaven even the lord and the weapons of his indignation to destroy the whole land howl ye for the day of the lord is at hand it shall come as a destruction from the almighty therefore shall all hands be faint and every man s heart shall melt and they shall be afraid pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth they shall be amazed one at another their faces shall be as flames behold the day of the lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it for the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light the sun shall be darkened in his going forth and the moon shall not cause her light to shine and i will punish the world for their evil and the wicked for their iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible i will make a man more precious than fine gold even a man than the golden wedge of ophir therefore i will shake the heavens and the earth shall remove out of her place in the wrath of the lord of hosts and in the day of his fierce anger and it shall be as the chased roe and as a sheep that no man taketh up they shall every man turn to his own people and flee every one into his own land every one that is found shall be thrust through and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes their houses shall be spoiled and their wives ravished behold i will stir up the medes against them which shall not regard silver and as for gold they shall not delight in it their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb their eye shall not spare children and babylon the glory of kingdoms the beauty of the chaldees excellency shall be as when god overthrew sodom and gomorrah it shall never be inhabited neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation neither shall the arabian pitch tent there neither shall the shepherds make their fold there but wild beasts of the desert shall lie there and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures and owls shall dwell there and satyrs shall dance there and the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant palaces and her time is near to come and her days shall not be prolonged for the lord will have mercy on jacob and will yet choose israel and set them in their own land and the strangers shall be joined with them and they shall cleave to the house of jacob and the people shall take them and bring them to their place and the house of israel shall possess them in the land of the lord for servants and handmaids and they shall take them captives whose captives they were and they shall rule over their oppressors and it shall come to pass in the day that the lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow and from thy fear and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of babylon and say how hath the oppressor ceased the golden city ceased the lord hath broken the staff of the wicked and the sceptre of the rulers he who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke he that ruled the nations in anger is persecuted and none hindereth the whole earth is at rest and is quiet they break forth into singing yea the fir trees rejoice at thee and the cedars of lebanon saying since thou art laid down no feller is come up against us hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming it stirreth up the dead for thee even all the chief ones of the earth it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations all they shall speak and say unto thee art thou also become weak as we art thou become like unto us thy pomp is brought down to the grave and the noise of thy viols the worm is spread under thee and the worms cover thee how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations for thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms that made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of his prisoners all the kings of the nations even all of them lie in glory every one in his own house but thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch and as the raiment of those that are slain thrust through with a sword that go down to the stones of the pit as a carcase trodden under feet thou shalt not be joined with them in burial because thou hast destroyed thy land and slain thy people the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers that they do not rise nor possess the land nor fill the face of the world with cities for i will rise up against them saith the lord of hosts and cut off from babylon the name and remnant and son and nephew saith the lord i will also make it a possession for the bittern and pools of water and i will sweep it with the besom of destruction saith the lord of hosts the lord of hosts hath sworn saying surely as i have thought so shall it come to pass and as i have purposed so shall it stand that i will break the assyrian in my land and upon my mountains tread him under foot then shall his yoke depart from off them and his burden depart from off their shoulders this is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations for the lord of hosts hath purposed and who shall disannul it and his hand is stretched out and who shall turn it back in the year that king ahaz died was this burden rejoice not thou whole palestina because the rod of him that smote thee is broken for out of the serpent s root shall come forth a cockatrice and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent and the firstborn of the poor shall feed and the needy shall lie down in safety and i will kill thy root with famine and he shall slay thy remnant howl o gate cry o city thou whole palestina art dissolved for there shall come from the north a smoke and none shall be alone in his appointed times what shall one then answer the messengers of the nation that the lord hath founded zion and the poor of his people shall trust in it the burden of moab because in the night ar of moab is laid waste and brought to silence because in the night kir of moab is laid waste and brought to silence he is gone up to bajith and to dibon the high places to weep moab shall howl over nebo and over medeba on all their heads shall be baldness and every beard cut off in their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth on the tops of their houses and in their streets every one shall howl weeping abundantly and heshbon shall cry and elealeh their voice shall be heard even unto jahaz therefore the armed soldiers of moab shall cry out his life shall be grievous unto him my heart shall cry out for moab his fugitives shall flee unto zoar an heifer of three years old for by the mounting up of luhith with weeping shall they go it up for in the way of horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction for the waters of nimrim shall be desolate for the hay is withered away the grass faileth there is no green thing therefore the abundance they have gotten and that which they have laid up shall they carry away to the brook of the willows for the cry is gone round about the borders of moab the howling thereof unto eglaim and the howling thereof unto beerelim for the waters of dimon shall be full of blood for i will bring more upon dimon lions upon him that escapeth of moab and upon the remnant of the land send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from sela to the wilderness unto the mount of the daughter of zion for it shall be that as a wandering bird cast out of the nest so the daughters of moab shall be at the fords of arnon take counsel execute judgment make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday hide the outcasts bewray not him that wandereth let mine outcasts dwell with thee moab be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler for the extortioner is at an end the spoiler ceaseth the oppressors are consumed out of the land and in mercy shall the throne be established and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of david judging and seeking judgment and hasting righteousness we have heard of the pride of moab he is very proud even of his haughtiness and his pride and his wrath but his lies shall not be so therefore shall moab howl for moab every one shall howl for the foundations of kirhareseth shall ye mourn surely they are stricken for the fields of heshbon languish and the vine of sibmah the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof they are come even unto jazer they wandered through the wilderness her branches are stretched out they are gone over the sea therefore i will bewail with the weeping of jazer the vine of sibmah i will water thee with my tears o heshbon and elealeh for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen and gladness is taken away and joy out of the plentiful field and in the vineyards there shall be no singing neither shall there be shouting the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses i have made their vintage shouting to cease wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for moab and mine inward parts for kirharesh and it shall come to pass when it is seen that moab is weary on the high place that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray but he shall not prevail this is the word that the lord hath spoken concerning moab since that time but now the lord hath spoken saying within three years as the years of an hireling and the glory of moab shall be contemned with all that great multitude and the remnant shall be very small and feeble the burden of damascus behold damascus is taken away from being a city and it shall be a ruinous heap the cities of aroer are forsaken they shall be for flocks which shall lie down and none shall make them afraid the fortress also shall cease from ephraim and the kingdom from damascus and the remnant of syria they shall be as the glory of the children of israel saith the lord of hosts and in that day it shall come to pass that the glory of jacob shall be made thin and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean and it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn and reapeth the ears with his arm and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of rephaim yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it as the shaking of an olive tree two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof saith the lord god of israel at that day shall a man look to his maker and his eyes shall have respect to the holy one of israel and he shall not look to the altars the work of his hands neither shall respect that which his fingers have made either the groves or the images in that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough and an uppermost branch which they left because of the children of israel and there shall be desolation because thou hast forgotten the god of thy salvation and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants and shalt set it with strange slips in the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow woe to the multitude of many people which make a noise like the noise of the seas and to the rushing of nations that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters the nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters but god shall rebuke them and they shall flee far off and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind and behold at eveningtide trouble and before the morning he is not this is the portion of them that spoil us and the lot of them that rob us woe to the land shadowing with wings which is beyond the rivers of ethiopia that sendeth ambassadors by the sea even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters saying go ye swift messengers to a nation scattered and peeled to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto a nation meted out and trodden down whose land the rivers have spoiled all ye inhabitants of the world and dwellers on the earth see ye when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains and when he bloweth a trumpet hear ye for so the lord said unto me i will take my rest and i will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest for afore the harvest when the bud is perfect and the sour grape is ripening in the flower he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks and take away and cut down the branches they shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains and to the beasts of the earth and the fowls shall summer upon them and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them in that time shall the present be brought unto the lord of hosts of a people scattered and peeled and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto a nation meted out and trodden under foot whose land the rivers have spoiled to the place of the name of the lord of hosts the mount zion the burden of egypt behold the lord rideth upon a swift cloud and shall come into egypt and the idols of egypt shall be moved at his presence and the heart of egypt shall melt in the midst of it and i will set the egyptians against the egyptians and they shall fight every one against his brother and every one against his neighbour city against city and kingdom against kingdom and the spirit of egypt shall fail in the midst thereof and i will destroy the counsel thereof and they shall seek to the idols and to the charmers and to them that have familiar spirits and to the wizards and the egyptians will i give over into the hand of a cruel lord and a fierce king shall rule over them saith the lord the lord of hosts and the waters shall fail from the sea and the river shall be wasted and dried up and they shall turn the rivers far away and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up the reeds and flags shall wither the paper reeds by the brooks by the mouth of the brooks and every thing sown by the brooks shall wither be driven away and be no more the fishers also shall mourn and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish moreover they that work in fine flax and they that weave networks shall be confounded and they shall be broken in the purposes thereof all that make sluices and ponds for fish surely the princes of zoan are fools the counsel of the wise counsellors of pharaoh is become brutish how say ye unto pharaoh i am the son of the wise the son of ancient kings where are they where are thy wise men and let them tell thee now and let them know what the lord of hosts hath purposed upon egypt the princes of zoan are become fools the princes of noph are deceived they have also seduced egypt even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof the lord hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof and they have caused egypt to err in every work thereof as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit neither shall there be any work for egypt which the head or tail branch or rush may do in that day shall egypt be like unto women and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the lord of hosts which he shaketh over it and the land of judah shall be a terror unto egypt every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself because of the counsel of the lord of hosts which he hath determined against it in that day shall five cities in the land of egypt speak the language of canaan and swear to the lord of hosts one shall be called the city of destruction in that day shall there be an altar to the lord in the midst of the land of egypt and a pillar at the border thereof to the lord and it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the lord of hosts in the land of egypt for they shall cry unto the lord because of the oppressors and he shall send them a saviour and a great one and he shall deliver them and the lord shall be known to egypt and the egyptians shall know the lord in that day and shall do sacrifice and oblation yea they shall vow a vow unto the lord and perform it and the lord shall smite egypt he shall smite and heal it and they shall return even to the lord and he shall be intreated of them and shall heal them in that day shall there be a highway out of egypt to assyria and the assyrian shall come into egypt and the egyptian into assyria and the egyptians shall serve with the assyrians in that day shall israel be the third with egypt and with assyria even a blessing in the midst of the land whom the lord of hosts shall bless saying blessed be egypt my people and assyria the work of my hands and israel mine inheritance in the year that tartan came unto ashdod when sargon the king of assyria sent him and fought against ashdod and took it at the same time spake the lord by isaiah the son of amoz saying go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins and put off thy shoe from thy foot and he did so walking naked and barefoot and the lord said like as my servant isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon egypt and upon ethiopia so shall the king of assyria lead away the egyptians prisoners and the ethiopians captives young and old naked and barefoot even with their buttocks uncovered to the shame of egypt and they shall be afraid and ashamed of ethiopia their expectation and of egypt their glory and the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day behold such is our expectation whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of assyria and how shall we escape the burden of the desert of the sea as whirlwinds in the south pass through so it cometh from the desert from a terrible land a grievous vision is declared unto me the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously and the spoiler spoileth go up o elam besiege o media all the sighing thereof have i made to cease therefore are my loins filled with pain pangs have taken hold upon me as the pangs of a woman that travaileth i was bowed down at the hearing of it i was dismayed at the seeing of it my heart panted fearfulness affrighted me the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me prepare the table watch in the watchtower eat drink arise ye princes and anoint the shield for thus hath the lord said unto me go set a watchman let him declare what he seeth and he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen a chariot of asses and a chariot of camels and he hearkened diligently with much heed and he cried a lion my lord i stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime and i am set in my ward whole nights and behold here cometh a chariot of men with a couple of horsemen and he answered and said babylon is fallen is fallen and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground o my threshing and the corn of my floor that which i have heard of the lord of hosts the god of israel have i declared unto you the burden of dumah he calleth to me out of seir watchman what of the night watchman what of the night the watchman said the morning cometh and also the night if ye will enquire enquire ye return come the burden upon arabia in the forest in arabia shall ye lodge o ye travelling companies of dedanim the inhabitants of the land of tema brought water to him that was thirsty they prevented with their bread him that fled for they fled from the swords from the drawn sword and from the bent bow and from the grievousness of war for thus hath the lord said unto me within a year according to the years of an hireling and all the glory of kedar shall fail and the residue of the number of archers the mighty men of the children of kedar shall be diminished for the lord god of israel hath spoken it the burden of the valley of vision what aileth thee now that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops thou that art full of stirs a tumultuous city a joyous city thy slain men are not slain with the sword nor dead in battle all thy rulers are fled together they are bound by the archers all that are found in thee are bound together which have fled from far therefore said i look away from me i will weep bitterly labour not to comfort me because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people for it is a day of trouble and of treading down and of perplexity by the lord god of hosts in the valley of vision breaking down the walls and of crying to the mountains and elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen and kir uncovered the shield and it shall come to pass that thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate and he discovered the covering of judah and thou didst look in that day to the armour of the house of the forest ye have seen also the breaches of the city of david that they are many and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool and ye have numbered the houses of jerusalem and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago and in that day did the lord god of hosts call to weeping and to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth and behold joy and gladness slaying oxen and killing sheep eating flesh and drinking wine let us eat and drink for to morrow we shall die and it was revealed in mine ears by the lord of hosts surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die saith the lord god of hosts thus saith the lord god of hosts go get thee unto this treasurer even unto shebna which is over the house and say what hast thou here and whom hast thou here that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock behold the lord will carry thee away with a mighty captivity and will surely cover thee he will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country there shalt thou die and there the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord s house and i will drive thee from thy station and from thy state shall he pull thee down and it shall come to pass in that day that i will call my servant eliakim the son of hilkiah and i will clothe him with thy robe and strengthen him with thy girdle and i will commit thy government into his hand and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of jerusalem and to the house of judah and the key of the house of david will i lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open and i will fasten him as a nail in a sure place and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father s house and they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father s house the offspring and the issue all vessels of small quantity from the vessels of cups even to all the vessels of flagons in that day saith the lord of hosts shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed and be cut down and fall and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off for the lord hath spoken it the burden of tyre howl ye ships of tarshish for it is laid waste so that there is no house no entering in from the land of chittim it is revealed to them be still ye inhabitants of the isle thou whom the merchants of zidon that pass over the sea have replenished and by great waters the seed of sihor the harvest of the river is her revenue and she is a mart of nations be thou ashamed o zidon for the sea hath spoken even the strength of the sea saying i travail not nor bring forth children neither do i nourish up young men nor bring up virgins as at the report concerning egypt so shall they be sorely pained at the report of tyre pass ye over to tarshish howl ye inhabitants of the isle is this your joyous city whose antiquity is of ancient days her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn who hath taken this counsel against tyre the crowning city whose merchants are princes whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth the lord of hosts hath purposed it to stain the pride of all glory and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth pass through thy land as a river o daughter of tarshish there is no more strength he stretched out his hand over the sea he shook the kingdoms the lord hath given a commandment against the merchant city to destroy the strong holds thereof and he said thou shalt no more rejoice o thou oppressed virgin daughter of zidon arise pass over to chittim there also shalt thou have no rest behold the land of the chaldeans this people was not till the assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness they set up the towers thereof they raised up the palaces thereof and he brought it to ruin howl ye ships of tarshish for your strength is laid waste and it shall come to pass in that day that tyre shall be forgotten seventy years according to the days of one king after the end of seventy years shall tyre sing as an harlot take an harp go about the city thou harlot that hast been forgotten make sweet melody sing many songs that thou mayest be remembered and it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years that the lord will visit tyre and she shall turn to her hire and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth and her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the lord it shall not be treasured nor laid up for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the lord to eat sufficiently and for durable clothing behold the lord maketh the earth empty and maketh it waste and turneth it upside down and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof and it shall be as with the people so with the priest as with the servant so with his master as with the maid so with her mistress as with the buyer so with the seller as with the lender so with the borrower as with the taker of usury so with the giver of usury to him the land shall be utterly emptied and utterly spoiled for the lord hath spoken this word the earth mourneth and fadeth away the world languisheth and fadeth away the haughty people of the earth do languish the earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof because they have transgressed the laws changed the ordinance broken the everlasting covenant therefore hath the curse devoured the earth and they that dwell therein are desolate therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned and few men left the new wine mourneth the vine languisheth all the merryhearted do sigh the mirth of tabrets ceaseth the noise of them that rejoice endeth the joy of the harp ceaseth they shall not drink wine with a song strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it the city of confusion is broken down every house is shut up that no man may come in there is a crying for wine in the streets all joy is darkened the mirth of the land is gone in the city is left desolation and the gate is smitten with destruction when thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done they shall lift up their voice they shall sing for the majesty of the lord they shall cry aloud from the sea wherefore glorify ye the lord in the fires even the name of the lord god of israel in the isles of the sea from the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs even glory to the righteous but i said my leanness my leanness woe unto me the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously yea the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously fear and the pit and the snare are upon thee o inhabitant of the earth and it shall come to pass that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare for the windows from on high are open and the foundations of the earth do shake the earth is utterly broken down the earth is clean dissolved the earth is moved exceedingly the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard and shall be removed like a cottage and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it and it shall fall and not rise again and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high and the kings of the earth upon the earth and they shall be gathered together as prisoners are gathered in the pit and shall be shut up in the prison and after many days shall they be visited then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed when the lord of hosts shall reign in mount zion and in jerusalem and before his ancients gloriously o lord thou art my god i will exalt thee i will praise thy name for thou hast done wonderful things thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth for thou hast made of a city an heap of a defenced city a ruin a palace of strangers to be no city it shall never be built therefore shall the strong people glorify thee the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee for thou hast been a strength to the poor a strength to the needy in his distress a refuge from the storm a shadow from the heat when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers as the heat in a dry place even the heat with the shadow of a cloud the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low and in this mountain shall the lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things a feast of wines on the lees of fat things full of marrow of wines on the lees well refined and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people and the vail that is spread over all nations he will swallow up death in victory and the lord god will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth for the lord hath spoken it and it shall be said in that day lo this is our god we have waited for him and he will save us this is the lord we have waited for him we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation for in this mountain shall the hand of the lord rest and moab shall be trodden down under him even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands and the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down lay low and bring to the ground even to the dust in that day shall this song be sung in the land of judah we have a strong city salvation will god appoint for walls and bulwarks open ye the gates that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee trust ye in the lord for ever for in the lord jehovah is everlasting strength for he bringeth down them that dwell on high the lofty city he layeth it low he layeth it low even to the ground he bringeth it even to the dust the foot shall tread it down even the feet of the poor and the steps of the needy the way of the just is uprightness thou most upright dost weigh the path of the just yea in the way of thy judgments o lord have we waited for thee the desire of our soul is to thy name and to the remembrance of thee with my soul have i desired thee in the night yea with my spirit within me will i seek thee early for when thy judgments are in the earth the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness let favour be shewed to the wicked yet will he not learn righteousness in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly and will not behold the majesty of the lord lord when thy hand is lifted up they will not see but they shall see and be ashamed for their envy at the people yea the fire of thine enemies shall devour them lord thou wilt ordain peace for us for thou also hast wrought all our works in us o lord our god other lords beside thee have had dominion over us but by thee only will we make mention of thy name they are dead they shall not live they are deceased they shall not rise therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them and made all their memory to perish thou hast increased the nation o lord thou hast increased the nation thou art glorified thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends of the earth lord in trouble have they visited thee they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them like as a woman with child that draweth near the time of her delivery is in pain and crieth out in her pangs so have we been in thy sight o lord we have been with child we have been in pain we have as it were brought forth wind we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen thy dead men shall live together with my dead body shall they arise awake and sing ye that dwell in dust for thy dew is as the dew of herbs and the earth shall cast out the dead come my people enter thou into thy chambers and shut thy doors about thee hide thyself as it were for a little moment until the indignation be overpast for behold the lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity the earth also shall disclose her blood and shall no more cover her slain in that day the lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent even leviathan that crooked serpent and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea in that day sing ye unto her a vineyard of red wine i the lord do keep it i will water it every moment lest any hurt it i will keep it night and day fury is not in me who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle i would go through them i would burn them together or let him take hold of my strength that he may make peace with me and he shall make peace with me he shall cause them that come of jacob to take root israel shall blossom and bud and fill the face of the world with fruit hath he smitten him as he smote those that smote him or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him in measure when it shooteth forth thou wilt debate with it he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind by this therefore shall the iniquity of jacob be purged and this is all the fruit to take away his sin when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder the groves and images shall not stand up yet the defenced city shall be desolate and the habitation forsaken and left like a wilderness there shall the calf feed and there shall he lie down and consume the branches thereof when the boughs thereof are withered they shall be broken off the women come and set them on fire for it is a people of no understanding therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them and he that formed them will shew them no favour and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of egypt and ye shall be gathered one by one o ye children of israel and it shall come to pass in that day that the great trumpet shall be blown and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of assyria and the outcasts in the land of egypt and shall worship the lord in the holy mount at jerusalem woe to the crown of pride to the drunkards of ephraim whose glorious beauty is a fading flower which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine behold the lord hath a mighty and strong one which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm as a flood of mighty waters overflowing shall cast down to the earth with the hand the crown of pride the drunkards of ephraim shall be trodden under feet and the glorious beauty which is on the head of the fat valley shall be a fading flower and as the hasty fruit before the summer which when he that looketh upon it seeth while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up in that day shall the lord of hosts be for a crown of glory and for a diadem of beauty unto the residue of his people and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate but they also have erred through wine and through strong drink are out of the way the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink they are swallowed up of wine they are out of the way through strong drink they err in vision they stumble in judgment for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear but the word of the lord was unto them precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken wherefore hear the word of the lord ye scornful men that rule this people which is in jerusalem because ye have said we have made a covenant with death and with hell are we at agreement when the overflowing scourge shall pass through it shall not come unto us for we have made lies our refuge and under falsehood have we hid ourselves therefore thus saith the lord god behold i lay in zion for a foundation a stone a tried stone a precious corner stone a sure foundation he that believeth shall not make haste judgment also will i lay to the line and righteousness to the plummet and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies and the waters shall overflow the hiding place and your covenant with death shall be disannulled and your agreement with hell shall not stand when the overflowing scourge shall pass through then ye shall be trodden down by it from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you for morning by morning shall it pass over by day and by night and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it for the lord shall rise up as in mount perazim he shall be wroth as in the valley of gibeon that he may do his work his strange work and bring to pass his act his strange act now therefore be ye not mockers lest your bands be made strong for i have heard from the lord god of hosts a consumption even determined upon the whole earth give ye ear and hear my voice hearken and hear my speech doth the plowman plow all day to sow doth he open and break the clods of his ground when he hath made plain the face thereof doth he not cast abroad the fitches and scatter the cummin and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place for his god doth instruct him to discretion and doth teach him for the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin but the fitches are beaten out with a staff and the cummin with a rod bread corn is bruised because he will not ever be threshing it nor break it with the wheel of his cart nor bruise it with his horsemen this also cometh forth from the lord of hosts which is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working woe to ariel to ariel the city where david dwelt add ye year to year let them kill sacrifices yet i will distress ariel and there shall be heaviness and sorrow and it shall be unto me as ariel and i will camp against thee round about and will lay siege against thee with a mount and i will raise forts against thee and thou shalt be brought down and shalt speak out of the ground and thy speech shall be low out of the dust and thy voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit out of the ground and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away yea it shall be at an instant suddenly thou shalt be visited of the lord of hosts with thunder and with earthquake and great noise with storm and tempest and the flame of devouring fire and the multitude of all the nations that fight against ariel even all that fight against her and her munition and that distress her shall be as a dream of a night vision it shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty or as when a thirsty man dreameth and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint and his soul hath appetite so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against mount zion stay yourselves and wonder cry ye out and cry they are drunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink for the lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and hath closed your eyes the prophets and your rulers the seers hath he covered and the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed which men deliver to one that is learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i cannot for it is sealed and the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i am not learned wherefore the lord said forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips do honour me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men therefore behold i will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people even a marvellous work and a wonder for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the lord and their works are in the dark and they say who seeth us and who knoweth us surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter s clay for shall the work say of him that made it he made me not or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it he had no understanding is it not yet a very little while and lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest and in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness the meek also shall increase their joy in the lord and the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy one of israel for the terrible one is brought to nought and the scorner is consumed and all that watch for iniquity are cut off that make a man an offender for a word and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate and turn aside the just for a thing of nought therefore thus saith the lord who redeemed abraham concerning the house of jacob jacob shall not now be ashamed neither shall his face now wax pale but when he seeth his children the work of mine hands in the midst of him they shall sanctify my name and sanctify the holy one of jacob and shall fear the god of israel they also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding and they that murmured shall learn doctrine woe to the rebellious children saith the lord that take counsel but not of me and that cover with a covering but not of my spirit that they may add sin to sin that walk to go down into egypt and have not asked at my mouth to strengthen themselves in the strength of pharaoh and to trust in the shadow of egypt therefore shall the strength of pharaoh be your shame and the trust in the shadow of egypt your confusion for his princes were at zoan and his ambassadors came to hanes they were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them nor be an help nor profit but a shame and also a reproach the burden of the beasts of the south into the land of trouble and anguish from whence come the young and old lion the viper and fiery flying serpent they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses and their treasures upon the bunches of camels to a people that shall not profit them for the egyptians shall help in vain and to no purpose therefore have i cried concerning this their strength is to sit still now go write it before them in a table and note it in a book that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever that this is a rebellious people lying children children that will not hear the law of the lord which say to the seers see not and to the prophets prophesy not unto us right things speak unto us smooth things prophesy deceits get you out of the way turn aside out of the path cause the holy one of israel to cease from before us wherefore thus saith the holy one of israel because ye despise this word and trust in oppression and perverseness and stay thereon therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall swelling out in a high wall whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant and he shall break it as the breaking of the potters vessel that is broken in pieces he shall not spare so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth or to take water withal out of the pit for thus saith the lord god the holy one of israel in returning and rest shall ye be saved in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength and ye would not but ye said no for we will flee upon horses therefore shall ye flee and we will ride upon the swift therefore shall they that pursue you be swift one thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one at the rebuke of five shall ye flee till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain and as an ensign on an hill and therefore will the lord wait that he may be gracious unto you and therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy upon you for the lord is a god of judgment blessed are all they that wait for him for the people shall dwell in zion at jerusalem thou shalt weep no more he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry when he shall hear it he will answer thee and though the lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more but thine eyes shall see thy teachers and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee saying this is the way walk ye in it when ye turn to the right hand and when ye turn to the left ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver and the ornament of thy molten images of gold thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth thou shalt say unto it get thee hence then shall he give the rain of thy seed that thou shalt sow the ground withal and bread of the increase of the earth and it shall be fat and plenteous in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures the oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan and there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every high hill rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter when the towers fall moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days in the day that the lord bindeth up the breach of his people and healeth the stroke of their wound behold the name of the lord cometh from far burning with his anger and the burden thereof is heavy his lips are full of indignation and his tongue as a devouring fire and his breath as an overflowing stream shall reach to the midst of the neck to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people causing them to err ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept and gladness of heart as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the lord to the mighty one of israel and the lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard and shall shew the lighting down of his arm with the indignation of his anger and with the flame of a devouring fire with scattering and tempest and hailstones for through the voice of the lord shall the assyrian be beaten down which smote with a rod and in every place where the grounded staff shall pass which the lord shall lay upon him it shall be with tabrets and harps and in battles of shaking will he fight with it for tophet is ordained of old yea for the king it is prepared he hath made it deep and large the pile thereof is fire and much wood the breath of the lord like a stream of brimstone doth kindle it woe to them that go down to egypt for help and stay on horses and trust in chariots because they are many and in horsemen because they are very strong but they look not unto the holy one of israel neither seek the lord yet he also is wise and will bring evil and will not call back his words but will arise against the house of the evildoers and against the help of them that work iniquity now the egyptians are men and not god and their horses flesh and not spirit when the lord shall stretch out his hand both he that helpeth shall fall and he that is holpen shall fall down and they all shall fail together for thus hath the lord spoken unto me like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him he will not be afraid of their voice nor abase himself for the noise of them so shall the lord of hosts come down to fight for mount zion and for the hill thereof as birds flying so will the lord of hosts defend jerusalem defending also he will deliver it and passing over he will preserve it turn ye unto him from whom the children of israel have deeply revolted for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold which your own hands have made unto you for a sin then shall the assyrian fall with the sword not of a mighty man and the sword not of a mean man shall devour him but he shall flee from the sword and his young men shall be discomfited and he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign saith the lord whose fire is in zion and his furnace in jerusalem behold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in judgment and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind and a covert from the tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land and the eyes of them that see shall not be dim and the ears of them that hear shall hearken the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly the vile person shall be no more called liberal nor the churl said to be bountiful for the vile person will speak villany and his heart will work iniquity to practise hypocrisy and to utter error against the lord to make empty the soul of the hungry and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail the instruments also of the churl are evil he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words even when the needy speaketh right but the liberal deviseth liberal things and by liberal things shall he stand rise up ye women that are at ease hear my voice ye careless daughters give ear unto my speech many days and years shall ye be troubled ye careless women for the vintage shall fail the gathering shall not come tremble ye women that are at ease be troubled ye careless ones strip you and make you bare and gird sackcloth upon your loins they shall lament for the teats for the pleasant fields for the fruitful vine upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers yea upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city because the palaces shall be forsaken the multitude of the city shall be left the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever a joy of wild asses a pasture of flocks until the spirit be poured upon us from on high and the wilderness be a fruitful field and the fruitful field be counted for a forest then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness and righteousness remain in the fruitful field and the work of righteousness shall be peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever and my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation and in sure dwellings and in quiet resting places when it shall hail coming down on the forest and the city shall be low in a low place blessed are ye that sow beside all waters that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass woe to thee that spoilest and thou wast not spoiled and dealest treacherously and they dealt not treacherously with thee when thou shalt cease to spoil thou shalt be spoiled and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously they shall deal treacherously with thee o lord be gracious unto us we have waited for thee be thou their arm every morning our salvation also in the time of trouble at the noise of the tumult the people fled at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered and your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them the lord is exalted for he dwelleth on high he hath filled zion with judgment and righteousness and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times and strength of salvation the fear of the lord is his treasure behold their valiant ones shall cry without the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly the highways lie waste the wayfaring man ceaseth he hath broken the covenant he hath despised the cities he regardeth no man the earth mourneth and languisheth lebanon is ashamed and hewn down sharon is like a wilderness and bashan and carmel shake off their fruits now will i rise saith the lord now will i be exalted now will i lift up myself ye shall conceive chaff ye shall bring forth stubble your breath as fire shall devour you and the people shall be as the burnings of lime as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire hear ye that are far off what i have done and ye that are near acknowledge my might the sinners in zion are afraid fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings he that walketh righteously and speaketh uprightly he that despiseth the gain of oppressions that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil he shall dwell on high his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks bread shall be given him his waters shall be sure thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty they shall behold the land that is very far off thine heart shall meditate terror where is the scribe where is the receiver where is he that counted the towers thou shalt not see a fierce people a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive of a stammering tongue that thou canst not understand look upon zion the city of our solemnities thine eyes shall see jerusalem a quiet habitation a tabernacle that shall not be taken down not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken but there the glorious lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams wherein shall go no galley with oars neither shall gallant ship pass thereby for the lord is our judge the lord is our lawgiver the lord is our king he will save us thy tacklings are loosed they could not well strengthen their mast they could not spread the sail then is the prey of a great spoil divided the lame take the prey and the inhabitant shall not say i am sick the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity come near ye nations to hear and hearken ye people let the earth hear and all that is therein the world and all things that come forth of it for the indignation of the lord is upon all nations and his fury upon all their armies he hath utterly destroyed them he hath delivered them to the slaughter their slain also shall be cast out and their stink shall come up out of their carcases and the mountains shall be melted with their blood and all the host of heaven shall be dissolved and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll and all their host shall fall down as the leaf falleth off from the vine and as a falling fig from the fig tree for my sword shall be bathed in heaven behold it shall come down upon idumea and upon the people of my curse to judgment the sword of the lord is filled with blood it is made fat with fatness and with the blood of lambs and goats with the fat of the kidneys of rams for the lord hath a sacrifice in bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of idumea and the unicorns shall come down with them and the bullocks with the bulls and their land shall be soaked with blood and their dust made fat with fatness for it is the day of the lord s vengeance and the year of recompences for the controversy of zion and the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch and the dust thereof into brimstone and the land thereof shall become burning pitch it shall not be quenched night nor day the smoke thereof shall go up for ever from generation to generation it shall lie waste none shall pass through it for ever and ever but the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion and the stones of emptiness they shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom but none shall be there and all her princes shall be nothing and thorns shall come up in her palaces nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof and it shall be an habitation of dragons and a court for owls the wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island and the satyr shall cry to his fellow the screech owl also shall rest there and find for herself a place of rest there shall the great owl make her nest and lay and hatch and gather under her shadow there shall the vultures also be gathered every one with her mate seek ye out of the book of the lord and read no one of these shall fail none shall want her mate for my mouth it hath commanded and his spirit it hath gathered them and he hath cast the lot for them and his hand hath divided it unto them by line they shall possess it for ever from generation to generation shall they dwell therein the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose it shall blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and singing the glory of lebanon shall be given unto it the excellency of carmel and sharon they shall see the glory of the lord and the excellency of our god strengthen ye the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees say to them that are of a fearful heart be strong fear not behold your god will come with vengeance even god with a recompence he will come and save you then the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped then shall the lame man leap as an hart and the tongue of the dumb sing for in the wilderness shall waters break out and streams in the desert and the parched ground shall become a pool and the thirsty land springs of water in the habitation of dragons where each lay shall be grass with reeds and rushes and an highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men though fools shall not err therein no lion shall be there nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon it shall not be found there but the redeemed shall walk there and the ransomed of the lord shall return and come to zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee away now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah that sennacherib king of assyria came up against all the defenced cities of judah and took them and the king of assyria sent rabshakeh from lachish to jerusalem unto king hezekiah with a great army and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller s field then came forth unto him eliakim hilkiah s son which was over the house and shebna the scribe and joah asaph s son the recorder and rabshakeh said unto them say ye now to hezekiah thus saith the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trustest i say sayest thou but they are but vain words i have counsel and strength for war now on whom dost thou trust that thou rebellest against me lo thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed on egypt whereon if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is pharaoh king of egypt to all that trust in him but if thou say to me we trust in the lord our god is it not he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away and said to judah and to jerusalem ye shall worship before this altar now therefore give pledges i pray thee to my master the king of assyria and i will give thee two thousand horses if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master s servants and put thy trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen and am i now come up without the lord against this land to destroy it the lord said unto me go up against this land and destroy it then said eliakim and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh speak i pray thee unto thy servants in the syrian language for we understand it and speak not to us in the jews language in the ears of the people that are on the wall but rabshakeh said hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with you then rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the jews language and said hear ye the words of the great king the king of assyria thus saith the king let not hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord saying the lord will surely deliver us this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyria make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and eat ye every one of his vine and every one of his fig tree and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern until i come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land of bread and vineyards beware lest hezekiah persuade you saying the lord will deliver us hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of assyria where are the gods of hamath and arphad where are the gods of sepharvaim and have they delivered samaria out of my hand who are they among all the gods of these lands that have delivered their land out of my hand that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of my hand but they held their peace and answered him not a word for the king s commandment was saying answer him not then came eliakim the son of hilkiah that was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of rabshakeh and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the lord and he sent eliakim who was over the household and shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth unto isaiah the prophet the son of amoz and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of blasphemy for the children are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth it may be the lord thy god will hear the words of rabshakeh whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living god and will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heard wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say unto your master thus saith the lord be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard wherewith the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour and return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warring against libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish and he heard say concerning tirhakah king of ethiopia he is come forth to make war with thee and when he heard it he sent messengers to hezekiah saying thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah saying let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive thee saying jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of assyria behold thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed as gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of eden which were in telassar where is the king of hamath and the king of arphad and the king of the city of sepharvaim hena and ivah and hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it and hezekiah went up unto the house of the lord and spread it before the lord and hezekiah prayed unto the lord saying o lord of hosts god of israel that dwellest between the cherubims thou art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven and earth incline thine ear o lord and hear open thine eyes o lord and see and hear all the words of sennacherib which hath sent to reproach the living god of a truth lord the kings of assyria have laid waste all the nations and their countries and have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the work of men s hands wood and stone therefore they have destroyed them now therefore o lord our god save us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord even thou only then isaiah the son of amoz sent unto hezekiah saying thus saith the lord god of israel whereas thou hast prayed to me against sennacherib king of assyria this is the word which the lord hath spoken concerning him the virgin the daughter of zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high even against the holy one of israel by thy servants hast thou reproached the lord and hast said by the multitude of my chariots am i come up to the height of the mountains to the sides of lebanon and i will cut down the tall cedars thereof and the choice fir trees thereof and i will enter into the height of his border and the forest of his carmel i have digged and drunk water and with the sole of my feet have i dried up all the rivers of the besieged places hast thou not heard long ago how i have done it and of ancient times that i have formed it now have i brought it to pass that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as the green herb as the grass on the housetops and as corn blasted before it be grown up but i know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and thy rage against me because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears therefore will i put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest and this shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself and the second year that which springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that escape out of mount zion the zeal of the lord of hosts shall do this therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria he shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shields nor cast a bank against it by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall not come into this city saith the lord for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and for my servant david s sake then the angel of the lord went forth and smote in the camp of the assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand and when they arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at nineveh and it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god that adrammelech and sharezer his sons smote him with the sword and they escaped into the land of armenia and esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz came unto him and said unto him thus saith the lord set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live then hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed unto the lord and said remember now o lord i beseech thee how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore then came the word of the lord to isaiah saying go and say to hezekiah thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will add unto thy days fifteen years and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend this city and this shall be a sign unto thee from the lord that the lord will do this thing that he hath spoken behold i will bring again the shadow of the degrees which is gone down in the sun dial of ahaz ten degrees backward so the sun returned ten degrees by which degrees it was gone down the writing of hezekiah king of judah when he had been sick and was recovered of his sickness i said in the cutting off of my days i shall go to the gates of the grave i am deprived of the residue of my years i said i shall not see the lord even the lord in the land of the living i shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world mine age is departed and is removed from me as a shepherd s tent i have cut off like a weaver my life he will cut me off with pining sickness from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me i reckoned till morning that as a lion so will he break all my bones from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me like a crane or a swallow so did i chatter i did mourn as a dove mine eyes fail with looking upward o lord i am oppressed undertake for me what shall i say he hath both spoken unto me and himself hath done it i shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul o lord by these things men live and in all these things is the life of my spirit so wilt thou recover me and make me to live behold for peace i had great bitterness but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back for the grave cannot praise thee death can not celebrate thee they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth the living the living he shall praise thee as i do this day the father to the children shall make known thy truth the lord was ready to save me therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the lord for isaiah had said let them take a lump of figs and lay it for a plaister upon the boil and he shall recover hezekiah also had said what is the sign that i shall go up to the house of the lord at that time merodachbaladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent letters and a present to hezekiah for he had heard that he had been sick and was recovered and hezekiah was glad of them and shewed them the house of his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious ointment and all the house of his armour and all that was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that hezekiah shewed them not then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said unto him what said these men and from whence came they unto thee and hezekiah said they are come from a far country unto me even from babylon then said he what have they seen in thine house and hezekiah answered all that is in mine house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that i have not shewed them then said isaiah to hezekiah hear the word of the lord of hosts behold the days come that all that is in thine house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day shall be carried to babylon nothing shall be left saith the lord and of thy sons that shall issue from thee which thou shalt beget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon then said hezekiah to isaiah good is the word of the lord which thou hast spoken he said moreover for there shall be peace and truth in my days comfort ye comfort ye my people saith your god speak ye comfortably to jerusalem and cry unto her that her warfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardoned for she hath received of the lord s hand double for all her sins the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it the voice said cry and he said what shall i cry all flesh is grass and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field the grass withereth the flower fadeth because the spirit of the lord bloweth upon it surely the people is grass the grass withereth the flower fadeth but the word of our god shall stand for ever o zion that bringest good tidings get thee up into the high mountain o jerusalem that bringest good tidings lift up thy voice with strength lift it up be not afraid say unto the cities of judah behold your god behold the lord god will come with strong hand and his arm shall rule for him behold his reward is with him and his work before him he shall feed his flock like a shepherd he shall gather the lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead those that are with young who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and meted out heaven with the span and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance who hath directed the spirit of the lord or being his counsellor hath taught him with whom took he counsel and who instructed him and taught him in the path of judgment and taught him knowledge and shewed to him the way of understanding behold the nations are as a drop of a bucket and are counted as the small dust of the balance behold he taketh up the isles as a very little thing and lebanon is not sufficient to burn nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering all nations before him are as nothing and they are counted to him less than nothing and vanity to whom then will ye liken god or what likeness will ye compare unto him the workman melteth a graven image and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold and casteth silver chains he that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image that shall not be moved have ye not known have ye not heard hath it not been told you from the beginning have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in that bringeth the princes to nothing he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity yea they shall not be planted yea they shall not be sown yea their stock shall not take root in the earth and he shall also blow upon them and they shall wither and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble to whom then will ye liken me or shall i be equal saith the holy one lift up your eyes on high and behold who hath created these things that bringeth out their host by number he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might for that he is strong in power not one faileth why sayest thou o jacob and speakest o israel my way is hid from the lord and my judgment is passed over from my god hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength even the youths shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint keep silence before me o islands and let the people renew their strength let them come near then let them speak let us come near together to judgment who raised up the righteous man from the east called him to his foot gave the nations before him and made him rule over kings he gave them as the dust to his sword and as driven stubble to his bow he pursued them and passed safely even by the way that he had not gone with his feet who hath wrought and done it calling the generations from the beginning i the lord the first and with the last i am he the isles saw it and feared the ends of the earth were afraid drew near and came they helped every one his neighbour and every one said to his brother be of good courage so the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil saying it is ready for the sodering and he fastened it with nails that it should not be moved but thou israel art my servant jacob whom i have chosen the seed of abraham my friend thou whom i have taken from the ends of the earth and called thee from the chief men thereof and said unto thee thou art my servant i have chosen thee and not cast thee away fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness behold all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded they shall be as nothing and they that strive with thee shall perish thou shalt seek them and shalt not find them even them that contended with thee they that war against thee shall be as nothing and as a thing of nought for i the lord thy god will hold thy right hand saying unto thee fear not i will help thee fear not thou worm jacob and ye men of israel i will help thee saith the lord and thy redeemer the holy one of israel behold i will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth thou shalt thresh the mountains and beat them small and shalt make the hills as chaff thou shalt fan them and the wind shall carry them away and the whirlwind shall scatter them and thou shalt rejoice in the lord and shalt glory in the holy one of israel when the poor and needy seek water and there is none and their tongue faileth for thirst i the lord will hear them i the god of israel will not forsake them i will open rivers in high places and fountains in the midst of the valleys i will make the wilderness a pool of water and the dry land springs of water i will plant in the wilderness the cedar the shittah tree and the myrtle and the oil tree i will set in the desert the fir tree and the pine and the box tree together that they may see and know and consider and understand together that the hand of the lord hath done this and the holy one of israel hath created it produce your cause saith the lord bring forth your strong reasons saith the king of jacob let them bring them forth and shew us what shall happen let them shew the former things what they be that we may consider them and know the latter end of them or declare us things for to come shew the things that are to come hereafter that we may know that ye are gods yea do good or do evil that we may be dismayed and behold it together behold ye are of nothing and your work of nought an abomination is he that chooseth you i have raised up one from the north and he shall come from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name and he shall come upon princes as upon morter and as the potter treadeth clay who hath declared from the beginning that we may know and beforetime that we may say he is righteous yea there is none that sheweth yea there is none that declareth yea there is none that heareth your words the first shall say to zion behold behold them and i will give to jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings for i beheld and there was no man even among them and there was no counsellor that when i asked of them could answer a word behold they are all vanity their works are nothing their molten images are wind and confusion behold my servant whom i uphold mine elect in whom my soul delighteth i have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the gentiles he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street a bruised reed shall he not break and the smoking flax shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth he shall not fail nor be discouraged till he have set judgment in the earth and the isles shall wait for his law thus saith god the lord he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein i the lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house i am the lord that is my name and my glory will i not give to another neither my praise to graven images behold the former things are come to pass and new things do i declare before they spring forth i tell you of them sing unto the lord a new song and his praise from the end of the earth ye that go down to the sea and all that is therein the isles and the inhabitants thereof let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice the villages that kedar doth inhabit let the inhabitants of the rock sing let them shout from the top of the mountains let them give glory unto the lord and declare his praise in the islands the lord shall go forth as a mighty man he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war he shall cry yea roar he shall prevail against his enemies i have long time holden my peace i have been still and refrained myself now will i cry like a travailing woman i will destroy and devour at once i will make waste mountains and hills and dry up all their herbs and i will make the rivers islands and i will dry up the pools and i will bring the blind by a way that they knew not i will lead them in paths that they have not known i will make darkness light before them and crooked things straight these things will i do unto them and not forsake them they shall be turned back they shall be greatly ashamed that trust in graven images that say to the molten images ye are our gods hear ye deaf and look ye blind that ye may see who is blind but my servant or deaf as my messenger that i sent who is blind as he that is perfect and blind as the lord s servant seeing many things but thou observest not opening the ears but he heareth not the lord is well pleased for his righteousness sake he will magnify the law and make it honourable but this is a people robbed and spoiled they are all of them snared in holes and they are hid in prison houses they are for a prey and none delivereth for a spoil and none saith restore who among you will give ear to this who will hearken and hear for the time to come who gave jacob for a spoil and israel to the robbers did not the lord he against whom we have sinned for they would not walk in his ways neither were they obedient unto his law therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger and the strength of battle and it hath set him on fire round about yet he knew not and it burned him yet he laid it not to heart but now thus saith the lord that created thee o jacob and he that formed thee o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine when thou passest through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy saviour i gave egypt for thy ransom ethiopia and seba for thee since thou wast precious in my sight thou hast been honourable and i have loved thee therefore will i give men for thee and people for thy life fear not for i am with thee i will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west i will say to the north give up and to the south keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the earth even every one that is called by my name for i have created him for my glory i have formed him yea i have made him bring forth the blind people that have eyes and the deaf that have ears let all the nations be gathered together and let the people be assembled who among them can declare this and shew us former things let them bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say it is truth ye are my witnesses saith the lord and my servant whom i have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that i am he before me there was no god formed neither shall there be after me i even i am the lord and beside me there is no saviour i have declared and have saved and i have shewed when there was no strange god among you therefore ye are my witnesses saith the lord that i am god yea before the day was i am he and there is none that can deliver out of my hand i will work and who shall let it thus saith the lord your redeemer the holy one of israel for your sake i have sent to babylon and have brought down all their nobles and the chaldeans whose cry is in the ships i am the lord your holy one the creator of israel your king thus saith the lord which maketh a way in the sea and a path in the mighty waters which bringeth forth the chariot and horse the army and the power they shall lie down together they shall not rise they are extinct they are quenched as tow remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old behold i will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall ye not know it i will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert the beast of the field shall honour me the dragons and the owls because i give waters in the wilderness and rivers in the desert to give drink to my people my chosen this people have i formed for myself they shall shew forth my praise but thou hast not called upon me o jacob but thou hast been weary of me o israel thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices i have not caused thee to serve with an offering nor wearied thee with incense thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities i even i am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake and will not remember thy sins put me in remembrance let us plead together declare thou that thou mayest be justified thy first father hath sinned and thy teachers have transgressed against me therefore i have profaned the princes of the sanctuary and have given jacob to the curse and israel to reproaches yet now hear o jacob my servant and israel whom i have chosen thus saith the lord that made thee and formed thee from the womb which will help thee fear not o jacob my servant and thou jesurun whom i have chosen for i will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground i will pour my spirit upon thy seed and my blessing upon thine offspring and they shall spring up as among the grass as willows by the water courses one shall say i am the lord s and another shall call himself by the name of jacob and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the lord and surname himself by the name of israel thus saith the lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts i am the first and i am the last and beside me there is no god and who as i shall call and shall declare it and set it in order for me since i appointed the ancient people and the things that are coming and shall come let them shew unto them fear ye not neither be afraid have not i told thee from that time and have declared it ye are even my witnesses is there a god beside me yea there is no god i know not any they that make a graven image are all of them vanity and their delectable things shall not profit and they are their own witnesses they see not nor know that they may be ashamed who hath formed a god or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing behold all his fellows shall be ashamed and the workmen they are of men let them all be gathered together let them stand up yet they shall fear and they shall be ashamed together the smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals and fashioneth it with hammers and worketh it with the strength of his arms yea he is hungry and his strength faileth he drinketh no water and is faint the carpenter stretcheth out his rule he marketh it out with a line he fitteth it with planes and he marketh it out with the compass and maketh it after the figure of a man according to the beauty of a man that it may remain in the house he heweth him down cedars and taketh the cypress and the oak which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest he planteth an ash and the rain doth nourish it then shall it be for a man to burn for he will take thereof and warm himself yea he kindleth it and baketh bread yea he maketh a god and worshippeth it he maketh it a graven image and falleth down thereto he burneth part thereof in the fire with part thereof he eateth flesh he roasteth roast and is satisfied yea he warmeth himself and saith aha i am warm i have seen the fire and the residue thereof he maketh a god even his graven image he falleth down unto it and worshippeth it and prayeth unto it and saith deliver me for thou art my god they have not known nor understood for he hath shut their eyes that they cannot see and their hearts that they cannot understand and none considereth in his heart neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say i have burned part of it in the fire yea also i have baked bread upon the coals thereof i have roasted flesh and eaten it and shall i make the residue thereof an abomination shall i fall down to the stock of a tree he feedeth on ashes a deceived heart hath turned him aside that he cannot deliver his soul nor say is there not a lie in my right hand remember these o jacob and israel for thou art my servant i have formed thee thou art my servant o israel thou shalt not be forgotten of me i have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions and as a cloud thy sins return unto me for i have redeemed thee sing o ye heavens for the lord hath done it shout ye lower parts of the earth break forth into singing ye mountains o forest and every tree therein for the lord hath redeemed jacob and glorified himself in israel thus saith the lord thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb i am the lord that maketh all things that stretcheth forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself that frustrateth the tokens of the liars and maketh diviners mad that turneth wise men backward and maketh their knowledge foolish that confirmeth the word of his servant and performeth the counsel of his messengers that saith to jerusalem thou shalt be inhabited and to the cities of judah ye shall be built and i will raise up the decayed places thereof that saith to the deep be dry and i will dry up thy rivers that saith of cyrus he is my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure even saying to jerusalem thou shalt be built and to the temple thy foundation shall be laid thus saith the lord to his anointed to cyrus whose right hand i have holden to subdue nations before him and i will loose the loins of kings to open before him the two leaved gates and the gates shall not be shut i will go before thee and make the crooked places straight i will break in pieces the gates of brass and cut in sunder the bars of iron and i will give thee the treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places that thou mayest know that i the lord which call thee by thy name am the god of israel for jacob my servant s sake and israel mine elect i have even called thee by thy name i have surnamed thee though thou hast not known me i am the lord and there is none else there is no god beside me i girded thee though thou hast not known me that they may know from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none beside me i am the lord and there is none else i form the light and create darkness i make peace and create evil i the lord do all these things drop down ye heavens from above and let the skies pour down righteousness let the earth open and let them bring forth salvation and let righteousness spring up together i the lord have created it woe unto him that striveth with his maker let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it what makest thou or thy work he hath no hands woe unto him that saith unto his father what begettest thou or to the woman what hast thou brought forth thus saith the lord the holy one of israel and his maker ask me of things to come concerning my sons and concerning the work of my hands command ye me i have made the earth and created man upon it i even my hands have stretched out the heavens and all their host have i commanded i have raised him up in righteousness and i will direct all his ways he shall build my city and he shall let go my captives not for price nor reward saith the lord of hosts thus saith the lord the labour of egypt and merchandise of ethiopia and of the sabeans men of stature shall come over unto thee and they shall be thine they shall come after thee in chains they shall come over and they shall fall down unto thee they shall make supplication unto thee saying surely god is in thee and there is none else there is no god verily thou art a god that hidest thyself o god of israel the saviour they shall be ashamed and also confounded all of them they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols but israel shall be saved in the lord with an everlasting salvation ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end for thus saith the lord that created the heavens god himself that formed the earth and made it he hath established it he created it not in vain he formed it to be inhabited i am the lord and there is none else i have not spoken in secret in a dark place of the earth i said not unto the seed of jacob seek ye me in vain i the lord speak righteousness i declare things that are right assemble yourselves and come draw near together ye that are escaped of the nations they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image and pray unto a god that cannot save tell ye and bring them near yea let them take counsel together who hath declared this from ancient time who hath told it from that time have not i the lord and there is no god else beside me a just god and a saviour there is none beside me look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth for i am god and there is none else i have sworn by myself the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness and shall not return that unto me every knee shall bow every tongue shall swear surely shall one say in the lord have i righteousness and strength even to him shall men come and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed in the lord shall all the seed of israel be justified and shall glory bel boweth down nebo stoopeth their idols were upon the beasts and upon the cattle your carriages were heavy loaden they are a burden to the weary beast they stoop they bow down together they could not deliver the burden but themselves are gone into captivity hearken unto me o house of jacob and all the remnant of the house of israel which are borne by me from the belly which are carried from the womb and even to your old age i am he and even to hoar hairs will i carry you i have made and i will bear even i will carry and will deliver you to whom will ye liken me and make me equal and compare me that we may be like they lavish gold out of the bag and weigh silver in the balance and hire a goldsmith and he maketh it a god they fall down yea they worship they bear him upon the shoulder they carry him and set him in his place and he standeth from his place shall he not remove yea one shall cry unto him yet can he not answer nor save him out of his trouble remember this and shew yourselves men bring it again to mind o ye transgressors remember the former things of old for i am god and there is none else i am god and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure calling a ravenous bird from the east the man that executeth my counsel from a far country yea i have spoken it i will also bring it to pass i have purposed it i will also do it hearken unto me ye stouthearted that are far from righteousness i bring near my righteousness it shall not be far off and my salvation shall not tarry and i will place salvation in zion for israel my glory come down and sit in the dust o virgin daughter of babylon sit on the ground there is no throne o daughter of the chaldeans for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate take the millstones and grind meal uncover thy locks make bare the leg uncover the thigh pass over the rivers thy nakedness shall be uncovered yea thy shame shall be seen i will take vengeance and i will not meet thee as a man as for our redeemer the lord of hosts is his name the holy one of israel sit thou silent and get thee into darkness o daughter of the chaldeans for thou shalt no more be called the lady of kingdoms i was wroth with my people i have polluted mine inheritance and given them into thine hand thou didst shew them no mercy upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke and thou saidst i shall be a lady for ever so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart neither didst remember the latter end of it therefore hear now this thou that art given to pleasures that dwellest carelessly that sayest in thine heart i am and none else beside me i shall not sit as a widow neither shall i know the loss of children but these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day the loss of children and widowhood they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries and for the great abundance of thine enchantments for thou hast trusted in thy wickedness thou hast said none seeth me thy wisdom and thy knowledge it hath perverted thee and thou hast said in thine heart i am and none else beside me therefore shall evil come upon thee thou shalt not know from whence it riseth and mischief shall fall upon thee thou shalt not be able to put it off and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly which thou shalt not know stand now with thine enchantments and with the multitude of thy sorceries wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth if so be thou shalt be able to profit if so be thou mayest prevail thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels let now the astrologers the stargazers the monthly prognosticators stand up and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee behold they shall be as stubble the fire shall burn them they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame there shall not be a coal to warm at nor fire to sit before it thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured even thy merchants from thy youth they shall wander every one to his quarter none shall save thee hear ye this o house of jacob which are called by the name of israel and are come forth out of the waters of judah which swear by the name of the lord and make mention of the god of israel but not in truth nor in righteousness for they call themselves of the holy city and stay themselves upon the god of israel the lord of hosts is his name i have declared the former things from the beginning and they went forth out of my mouth and i shewed them i did them suddenly and they came to pass because i knew that thou art obstinate and thy neck is an iron sinew and thy brow brass i have even from the beginning declared it to thee before it came to pass i shewed it thee lest thou shouldest say mine idol hath done them and my graven image and my molten image hath commanded them thou hast heard see all this and will not ye declare it i have shewed thee new things from this time even hidden things and thou didst not know them they are created now and not from the beginning even before the day when thou heardest them not lest thou shouldest say behold i knew them yea thou heardest not yea thou knewest not yea from that time that thine ear was not opened for i knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously and wast called a transgressor from the womb for my name s sake will i defer mine anger and for my praise will i refrain for thee that i cut thee not off behold i have refined thee but not with silver i have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction for mine own sake even for mine own sake will i do it for how should my name be polluted and i will not give my glory unto another hearken unto me o jacob and israel my called i am he i am the first i also am the last mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth and my right hand hath spanned the heavens when i call unto them they stand up together all ye assemble yourselves and hear which among them hath declared these things the lord hath loved him he will do his pleasure on babylon and his arm shall be on the chaldeans i even i have spoken yea i have called him i have brought him and he shall make his way prosperous come ye near unto me hear ye this i have not spoken in secret from the beginning from the time that it was there am i and now the lord god and his spirit hath sent me thus saith the lord thy redeemer the holy one of israel i am the lord thy god which teacheth thee to profit which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go o that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments then had thy peace been as a river and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea thy seed also had been as the sand and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me go ye forth of babylon flee ye from the chaldeans with a voice of singing declare ye tell this utter it even to the end of the earth say ye the lord hath redeemed his servant jacob and they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them he clave the rock also and the waters gushed out there is no peace saith the lord unto the wicked listen o isles unto me and hearken ye people from far the lord hath called me from the womb from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me and made me a polished shaft in his quiver hath he hid me and said unto me thou art my servant o israel in whom i will be glorified then i said i have laboured in vain i have spent my strength for nought and in vain yet surely my judgment is with the lord and my work with my god and now saith the lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant to bring jacob again to him though israel be not gathered yet shall i be glorious in the eyes of the lord and my god shall be my strength and he said it is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of jacob and to restore the preserved of israel i will also give thee for a light to the gentiles that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth thus saith the lord the redeemer of israel and his holy one to him whom man despiseth to him whom the nation abhorreth to a servant of rulers kings shall see and arise princes also shall worship because of the lord that is faithful and the holy one of israel and he shall choose thee thus saith the lord in an acceptable time have i heard thee and in a day of salvation have i helped thee and i will preserve thee and give thee for a covenant of the people to establish the earth to cause to inherit the desolate heritages that thou mayest say to the prisoners go forth to them that are in darkness shew yourselves they shall feed in the ways and their pastures shall be in all high places they shall not hunger nor thirst neither shall the heat nor sun smite them for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them even by the springs of water shall he guide them and i will make all my mountains a way and my highways shall be exalted behold these shall come from far and lo these from the north and from the west and these from the land of sinim sing o heavens and be joyful o earth and break forth into singing o mountains for the lord hath comforted his people and will have mercy upon his afflicted but zion said the lord hath forsaken me and my lord hath forgotten me can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yea they may forget yet will i not forget thee behold i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me thy children shall make haste thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee lift up thine eyes round about and behold all these gather themselves together and come to thee as i live saith the lord thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all as with an ornament and bind them on thee as a bride doeth for thy waste and thy desolate places and the land of thy destruction shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away the children which thou shalt have after thou hast lost the other shall say again in thine ears the place is too strait for me give place to me that i may dwell then shalt thou say in thine heart who hath begotten me these seeing i have lost my children and am desolate a captive and removing to and fro and who hath brought up these behold i was left alone these where had they been thus saith the lord god behold i will lift up mine hand to the gentiles and set up my standard to the people and they shall bring thy sons in their arms and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders and kings shall be thy nursing fathers and their queens thy nursing mothers they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth and lick up the dust of thy feet and thou shalt know that i am the lord for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me shall the prey be taken from the mighty or the lawful captive delivered but thus saith the lord even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered for i will contend with him that contendeth with thee and i will save thy children and i will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh and they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine and all flesh shall know that i the lord am thy saviour and thy redeemer the mighty one of jacob thus saith the lord where is the bill of your mother s divorcement whom i have put away or which of my creditors is it to whom i have sold you behold for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves and for your transgressions is your mother put away wherefore when i came was there no man when i called was there none to answer is my hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem or have i no power to deliver behold at my rebuke i dry up the sea i make the rivers a wilderness their fish stinketh because there is no water and dieth for thirst i clothe the heavens with blackness and i make sackcloth their covering the lord god hath given me the tongue of the learned that i should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary he wakeneth morning by morning he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned the lord god hath opened mine ear and i was not rebellious neither turned away back i gave my back to the smiters and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair i hid not my face from shame and spitting for the lord god will help me therefore shall i not be confounded therefore have i set my face like a flint and i know that i shall not be ashamed he is near that justifieth me who will contend with me let us stand together who is mine adversary let him come near to me behold the lord god will help me who is he that shall condemn me lo they all shall wax old as a garment the moth shall eat them up who is among you that feareth the lord that obeyeth the voice of his servant that walketh in darkness and hath no light let him trust in the name of the lord and stay upon his god behold all ye that kindle a fire that compass yourselves about with sparks walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks that ye have kindled this shall ye have of mine hand ye shall lie down in sorrow hearken to me ye that follow after righteousness ye that seek the lord look unto the rock whence ye are hewn and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged look unto abraham your father and unto sarah that bare you for i called him alone and blessed him and increased him for the lord shall comfort zion he will comfort all her waste places and he will make her wilderness like eden and her desert like the garden of the lord joy and gladness shall be found therein thanksgiving and the voice of melody hearken unto me my people and give ear unto me o my nation for a law shall proceed from me and i will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people my righteousness is near my salvation is gone forth and mine arms shall judge the people the isles shall wait upon me and on mine arm shall they trust lift up your eyes to the heavens and look upon the earth beneath for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke and the earth shall wax old like a garment and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner but my salvation shall be for ever and my righteousness shall not be abolished hearken unto me ye that know righteousness the people in whose heart is my law fear ye not the reproach of men neither be ye afraid of their revilings for the moth shall eat them up like a garment and the worm shall eat them like wool but my righteousness shall be for ever and my salvation from generation to generation awake awake put on strength o arm of the lord awake as in the ancient days in the generations of old art thou not it that hath cut rahab and wounded the dragon art thou not it which hath dried the sea the waters of the great deep that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over therefore the redeemed of the lord shall return and come with singing unto zion and everlasting joy shall be upon their head they shall obtain gladness and joy and sorrow and mourning shall flee away i even i am he that comforteth you who art thou that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die and of the son of man which shall be made as grass and forgettest the lord thy maker that hath stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor as if he were ready to destroy and where is the fury of the oppressor the captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed and that he should not die in the pit nor that his bread should fail but i am the lord thy god that divided the sea whose waves roared the lord of hosts is his name and i have put my words in thy mouth and i have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand that i may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth and say unto zion thou art my people awake awake stand up o jerusalem which hast drunk at the hand of the lord the cup of his fury thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling and wrung them out there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up these two things are come unto thee who shall be sorry for thee desolation and destruction and the famine and the sword by whom shall i comfort thee thy sons have fainted they lie at the head of all the streets as a wild bull in a net they are full of the fury of the lord the rebuke of thy god therefore hear now this thou afflicted and drunken but not with wine thus saith thy lord the lord and thy god that pleadeth the cause of his people behold i have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling even the dregs of the cup of my fury thou shalt no more drink it again but i will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee which have said to thy soul bow down that we may go over and thou hast laid thy body as the ground and as the street to them that went over awake awake put on thy strength o zion put on thy beautiful garments o jerusalem the holy city for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down o jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck o captive daughter of zion for thus saith the lord ye have sold yourselves for nought and ye shall be redeemed without money for thus saith the lord god my people went down aforetime into egypt to sojourn there and the assyrian oppressed them without cause now therefore what have i here saith the lord that my people is taken away for nought they that rule over them make them to howl saith the lord and my name continually every day is blasphemed therefore my people shall know my name therefore they shall know in that day that i am he that doth speak behold it is i how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace that bringeth good tidings of good that publisheth salvation that saith unto zion thy god reigneth thy watchmen shall lift up the voice with the voice together shall they sing for they shall see eye to eye when the lord shall bring again zion break forth into joy sing together ye waste places of jerusalem for the lord hath comforted his people he hath redeemed jerusalem the lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our god depart ye depart ye go ye out from thence touch no unclean thing go ye out of the midst of her be ye clean that bear the vessels of the lord for ye shall not go out with haste nor go by flight for the lord will go before you and the god of israel will be your rereward behold my servant shall deal prudently he shall be exalted and extolled and be very high as many were astonied at thee his visage was so marred more than any man and his form more than the sons of men so shall he sprinkle many nations the kings shall shut their mouths at him for that which had not been told them shall they see and that which they had not heard shall they consider who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will i divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors sing o barren thou that didst not bear break forth into singing and cry aloud thou that didst not travail with child for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife saith the lord enlarge the place of thy tent and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations spare not lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy stakes for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left and thy seed shall inherit the gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited fear not for thou shalt not be ashamed neither be thou confounded for thou shalt not be put to shame for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more for thy maker is thine husband the lord of hosts is his name and thy redeemer the holy one of israel the god of the whole earth shall he be called for the lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit and a wife of youth when thou wast refused saith thy god for a small moment have i forsaken thee but with great mercies will i gather thee in a little wrath i hid my face from thee for a moment but with everlasting kindness will i have mercy on thee saith the lord thy redeemer for this is as the waters of noah unto me for as i have sworn that the waters of noah should no more go over the earth so have i sworn that i would not be wroth with thee nor rebuke thee for the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed but my kindness shall not depart from thee neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed saith the lord that hath mercy on thee o thou afflicted tossed with tempest and not comforted behold i will lay thy stones with fair colours and lay thy foundations with sapphires and i will make thy windows of agates and thy gates of carbuncles and all thy borders of pleasant stones and all thy children shall be taught of the lord and great shall be the peace of thy children in righteousness shalt thou be established thou shalt be far from oppression for thou shalt not fear and from terror for it shall not come near thee behold they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake behold i have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and i have created the waster to destroy no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness is of me saith the lord ho every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters and he that hath no money come ye buy and eat yea come buy wine and milk without money and without price wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread and your labour for that which satisfieth not hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness incline your ear and come unto me hear and your soul shall live and i will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of david behold i have given him for a witness to the people a leader and commander to the people behold thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the lord thy god and for the holy one of israel for he hath glorified thee seek ye the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree and it shall be to the lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off thus saith the lord keep ye judgment and do justice for my salvation is near to come and my righteousness to be revealed blessed is the man that doeth this and the son of man that layeth hold on it that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and keepeth his hand from doing any evil neither let the son of the stranger that hath joined himself to the lord speak saying the lord hath utterly separated me from his people neither let the eunuch say behold i am a dry tree for thus saith the lord unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths and choose the things that please me and take hold of my covenant even unto them will i give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters i will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off also the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the lord to serve him and to love the name of the lord to be his servants every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and taketh hold of my covenant even them will i bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people the lord god which gathereth the outcasts of israel saith yet will i gather others to him beside those that are gathered unto him all ye beasts of the field come to devour yea all ye beasts in the forest his watchmen are blind they are all ignorant they are all dumb dogs they cannot bark sleeping lying down loving to slumber yea they are greedy dogs which can never have enough and they are shepherds that cannot understand they all look to their own way every one for his gain from his quarter come ye say they i will fetch wine and we will fill ourselves with strong drink and to morrow shall be as this day and much more abundant the righteous perisheth and no man layeth it to heart and merciful men are taken away none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come he shall enter into peace they shall rest in their beds each one walking in his uprightness but draw near hither ye sons of the sorceress the seed of the adulterer and the whore against whom do ye sport yourselves against whom make ye a wide mouth and draw out the tongue are ye not children of transgression a seed of falsehood enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion they they are thy lot even to them hast thou poured a drink offering thou hast offered a meat offering should i receive comfort in these upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me and art gone up thou hast enlarged thy bed and made thee a covenant with them thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it and thou wentest to the king with ointment and didst increase thy perfumes and didst send thy messengers far off and didst debase thyself even unto hell thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way yet saidst thou not there is no hope thou hast found the life of thine hand therefore thou wast not grieved and of whom hast thou been afraid or feared that thou hast lied and hast not remembered me nor laid it to thy heart have not i held my peace even of old and thou fearest me not i will declare thy righteousness and thy works for they shall not profit thee when thou criest let thy companies deliver thee but the wind shall carry them all away vanity shall take them but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my holy mountain and shall say cast ye up cast ye up prepare the way take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones for i will not contend for ever neither will i be always wroth for the spirit should fail before me and the souls which i have made for the iniquity of his covetousness was i wroth and smote him i hid me and was wroth and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart i have seen his ways and will heal him i will lead him also and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners i create the fruit of the lips peace peace to him that is far off and to him that is near saith the lord and i will heal him but the wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest whose waters cast up mire and dirt there is no peace saith my god to the wicked cry aloud spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet and shew my people their transgression and the house of jacob their sins yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways as a nation that did righteousness and forsook not the ordinance of their god they ask of me the ordinances of justice they take delight in approaching to god wherefore have we fasted say they and thou seest not wherefore have we afflicted our soul and thou takest no knowledge behold in the day of your fast ye find pleasure and exact all your labours behold ye fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness ye shall not fast as ye do this day to make your voice to be heard on high is it such a fast that i have chosen a day for a man to afflict his soul is it to bow down his head as a bulrush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him wilt thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to the lord is not this the fast that i have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house when thou seest the naked that thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thine health shall spring forth speedily and thy righteousness shall go before thee the glory of the lord shall be thy rereward then shalt thou call and the lord shall answer thou shalt cry and he shall say here i am if thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke the putting forth of the finger and speaking vanity and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be as the noon day and the lord shall guide thee continually and satisfy thy soul in drought and make fat thy bones and thou shalt be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose waters fail not and they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of paths to dwell in if thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the sabbath a delight the holy of the lord honourable and shalt honour him not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own words then shalt thou delight thyself in the lord and i will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth and feed thee with the heritage of jacob thy father for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it behold the lord s hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear but your iniquities have separated between you and your god and your sins have hid his face from you that he will not hear for your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity your lips have spoken lies your tongue hath muttered perverseness none calleth for justice nor any pleadeth for truth they trust in vanity and speak lies they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity they hatch cockatrice eggs and weave the spider s web he that eateth of their eggs dieth and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper their webs shall not become garments neither shall they cover themselves with their works their works are works of iniquity and the act of violence is in their hands their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed innocent blood their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity wasting and destruction are in their paths the way of peace they know not and there is no judgment in their goings they have made them crooked paths whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace therefore is judgment far from us neither doth justice overtake us we wait for light but behold obscurity for brightness but we walk in darkness we grope for the wall like the blind and we grope as if we had no eyes we stumble at noon day as in the night we are in desolate places as dead men we roar all like bears and mourn sore like doves we look for judgment but there is none for salvation but it is far off from us for our transgressions are multiplied before thee and our sins testify against us for our transgressions are with us and as for our iniquities we know them in transgressing and lying against the lord and departing away from our god speaking oppression and revolt conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood and judgment is turned away backward and justice standeth afar off for truth is fallen in the street and equity cannot enter yea truth faileth and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey and the lord saw it and it displeased him that there was no judgment and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and an helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak according to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries recompence to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompence so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him and the redeemer shall come to zion and unto them that turn from transgression in jacob saith the lord as for me this is my covenant with them saith the lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which i have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed s seed saith the lord from henceforth and for ever arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee and the gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to the brightness of thy rising lift up thine eyes round about and see all they gather themselves together they come to thee thy sons shall come from far and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side then thou shalt see and flow together and thine heart shall fear and be enlarged because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee the forces of the gentiles shall come unto thee the multitude of camels shall cover thee the dromedaries of midian and ephah all they from sheba shall come they shall bring gold and incense and they shall shew forth the praises of the lord all the flocks of kedar shall be gathered together unto thee the rams of nebaioth shall minister unto thee they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar and i will glorify the house of my glory who are these that fly as a cloud and as the doves to their windows surely the isles shall wait for me and the ships of tarshish first to bring thy sons from far their silver and their gold with them unto the name of the lord thy god and to the holy one of israel because he hath glorified thee and the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls and their kings shall minister unto thee for in my wrath i smote thee but in my favour have i had mercy on thee therefore thy gates shall be open continually they shall not be shut day nor night that men may bring unto thee the forces of the gentiles and that their kings may be brought for the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish yea those nations shall be utterly wasted the glory of lebanon shall come unto thee the fir tree the pine tree and the box together to beautify the place of my sanctuary and i will make the place of my feet glorious the sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet and they shall call thee the city of the lord the zion of the holy one of israel whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated so that no man went through thee i will make thee an eternal excellency a joy of many generations thou shalt also suck the milk of the gentiles and shalt suck the breast of kings and thou shalt know that i the lord am thy saviour and thy redeemer the mighty one of jacob for brass i will bring gold and for iron i will bring silver and for wood brass and for stones iron i will also make thy officers peace and thine exactors righteousness violence shall no more be heard in thy land wasting nor destruction within thy borders but thou shalt call thy walls salvation and thy gates praise the sun shall be no more thy light by day neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee but the lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light and thy god thy glory thy sun shall no more go down neither shall thy moon withdraw itself for the lord shall be thine everlasting light and the days of thy mourning shall be ended thy people also shall be all righteous they shall inherit the land for ever the branch of my planting the work of my hands that i may be glorified a little one shall become a thousand and a small one a strong nation i the lord will hasten it in his time the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified and they shall build the old wastes they shall raise up the former desolations and they shall repair the waste cities the desolations of many generations and strangers shall stand and feed your flocks and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers but ye shall be named the priests of the lord men shall call you the ministers of our god ye shall eat the riches of the gentiles and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves for your shame ye shall have double and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion therefore in their land they shall possess the double everlasting joy shall be unto them for i the lord love judgment i hate robbery for burnt offering and i will direct their work in truth and i will make an everlasting covenant with them and their seed shall be known among the gentiles and their offspring among the people all that see them shall acknowledge them that they are the seed which the lord hath blessed i will greatly rejoice in the lord my soul shall be joyful in my god for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels for as the earth bringeth forth her bud and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth so the lord god will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations for zion s sake will i not hold my peace and for jerusalem s sake i will not rest until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth and the gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all kings thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the lord shall name thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the lord and a royal diadem in the hand of thy god thou shalt no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land any more be termed desolate but thou shalt be called hephzibah and thy land beulah for the lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married for as a young man marrieth a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride so shall thy god rejoice over thee i have set watchmen upon thy walls o jerusalem which shall never hold their peace day nor night ye that make mention of the lord keep not silence and give him no rest till he establish and till he make jerusalem a praise in the earth the lord hath sworn by his right hand and by the arm of his strength surely i will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine for the which thou hast laboured but they that have gathered it shall eat it and praise the lord and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness go through go through the gates prepare ye the way of the people cast up cast up the highway gather out the stones lift up a standard for the people behold the lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world say ye to the daughter of zion behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward is with him and his work before him and they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of the lord and thou shalt be called sought out a city not forsaken who is this that cometh from edom with dyed garments from bozrah this that is glorious in his apparel travelling in the greatness of his strength i that speak in righteousness mighty to save wherefore art thou red in thine apparel and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat i have trodden the winepress alone and of the people there was none with me for i will tread them in mine anger and trample them in my fury and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments and i will stain all my raiment for the day of vengeance is in mine heart and the year of my redeemed is come and i looked and there was none to help and i wondered that there was none to uphold therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me and my fury it upheld me and i will tread down the people in mine anger and make them drunk in my fury and i will bring down their strength to the earth i will mention the lovingkindnesses of the lord and the praises of the lord according to all that the lord hath bestowed on us and the great goodness toward the house of israel which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses for he said surely they are my people children that will not lie so he was their saviour in all their affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them in his love and in his pity he redeemed them and he bare them and carried them all the days of old but they rebelled and vexed his holy spirit therefore he was turned to be their enemy and he fought against them then he remembered the days of old moses and his people saying where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock where is he that put his holy spirit within him that led them by the right hand of moses with his glorious arm dividing the water before them to make himself an everlasting name that led them through the deep as an horse in the wilderness that they should not stumble as a beast goeth down into the valley the spirit of the lord caused him to rest so didst thou lead thy people to make thyself a glorious name look down from heaven and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory where is thy zeal and thy strength the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me are they restrained doubtless thou art our father though abraham be ignorant of us and israel acknowledge us not thou o lord art our father our redeemer thy name is from everlasting o lord why hast thou made us to err from thy ways and hardened our heart from thy fear return for thy servants sake the tribes of thine inheritance the people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary we are thine thou never barest rule over them they were not called by thy name oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens that thou wouldest come down that the mountains might flow down at thy presence as when the melting fire burneth the fire causeth the waters to boil to make thy name known to thine adversaries that the nations may tremble at thy presence when thou didst terrible things which we looked not for thou camest down the mountains flowed down at thy presence for since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor perceived by the ear neither hath the eye seen o god beside thee what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness those that remember thee in thy ways behold thou art wroth for we have sinned in those is continuance and we shall be saved but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags and we all do fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away and there is none that calleth upon thy name that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee for thou hast hid thy face from us and hast consumed us because of our iniquities but now o lord thou art our father we are the clay and thou our potter and we all are the work of thy hand be not wroth very sore o lord neither remember iniquity for ever behold see we beseech thee we are all thy people thy holy cities are a wilderness zion is a wilderness jerusalem a desolation our holy and our beautiful house where our fathers praised thee is burned up with fire and all our pleasant things are laid waste wilt thou refrain thyself for these things o lord wilt thou hold thy peace and afflict us very sore i am sought of them that asked not for me i am found of them that sought me not i said behold me behold me unto a nation that was not called by my name i have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people which walketh in a way that was not good after their own thoughts a people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face that sacrificeth in gardens and burneth incense upon altars of brick which remain among the graves and lodge in the monuments which eat swine s flesh and broth of abominable things is in their vessels which say stand by thyself come not near to me for i am holier than thou these are a smoke in my nose a fire that burneth all the day behold it is written before me i will not keep silence but will recompense even recompense into their bosom your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together saith the lord which have burned incense upon the mountains and blasphemed me upon the hills therefore will i measure their former work into their bosom thus saith the lord as the new wine is found in the cluster and one saith destroy it not for a blessing is in it so will i do for my servants sakes that i may not destroy them all and i will bring forth a seed out of jacob and out of judah an inheritor of my mountains and mine elect shall inherit it and my servants shall dwell there and sharon shall be a fold of flocks and the valley of achor a place for the herds to lie down in for my people that have sought me but ye are they that forsake the lord that forget my holy mountain that prepare a table for that troop and that furnish the drink offering unto that number therefore will i number you to the sword and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter because when i called ye did not answer when i spake ye did not hear but did evil before mine eyes and did choose that wherein i delighted not therefore thus saith the lord god behold my servants shall eat but ye shall be hungry behold my servants shall drink but ye shall be thirsty behold my servants shall rejoice but ye shall be ashamed behold my servants shall sing for joy of heart but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart and shall howl for vexation of spirit and ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen for the lord god shall slay thee and call his servants by another name that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the god of truth and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the god of truth because the former troubles are forgotten and because they are hid from mine eyes for behold i create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind but be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which i create for behold i create jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy and i will rejoice in jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crying there shall be no more thence an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days for the child shall die an hundred years old but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands they shall not labour in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the blessed of the lord and their offspring with them and it shall come to pass that before they call i will answer and while they are yet speaking i will hear the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock and dust shall be the serpent s meat they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain saith the lord thus saith the lord the heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool where is the house that ye build unto me and where is the place of my rest for all those things hath mine hand made and all those things have been saith the lord but to this man will i look even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word he that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man he that sacrificeth a lamb as if he cut off a dog s neck he that offereth an oblation as if he offered swine s blood he that burneth incense as if he blessed an idol yea they have chosen their own ways and their soul delighteth in their abominations i also will choose their delusions and will bring their fears upon them because when i called none did answer when i spake they did not hear but they did evil before mine eyes and chose that in which i delighted not hear the word of the lord ye that tremble at his word your brethren that hated you that cast you out for my name s sake said let the lord be glorified but he shall appear to your joy and they shall be ashamed a voice of noise from the city a voice from the temple a voice of the lord that rendereth recompence to his enemies before she travailed she brought forth before her pain came she was delivered of a man child who hath heard such a thing who hath seen such things shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at once for as soon as zion travailed she brought forth her children shall i bring to the birth and not cause to bring forth saith the lord shall i cause to bring forth and shut the womb saith thy god rejoice ye with jerusalem and be glad with her all ye that love her rejoice for joy with her all ye that mourn for her that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations that ye may milk out and be delighted with the abundance of her glory for thus saith the lord behold i will extend peace to her like a river and the glory of the gentiles like a flowing stream then shall ye suck ye shall be borne upon her sides and be dandled upon her knees as one whom his mother comforteth so will i comfort you and ye shall be comforted in jerusalem and when ye see this your heart shall rejoice and your bones shall flourish like an herb and the hand of the lord shall be known toward his servants and his indignation toward his enemies for behold the lord will come with fire and with his chariots like a whirlwind to render his anger with fury and his rebuke with flames of fire for by fire and by his sword will the lord plead with all flesh and the slain of the lord shall be many they that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst eating swine s flesh and the abomination and the mouse shall be consumed together saith the lord for i know their works and their thoughts it shall come that i will gather all nations and tongues and they shall come and see my glory and i will set a sign among them and i will send those that escape of them unto the nations to tarshish pul and lud that draw the bow to tubal and javan to the isles afar off that have not heard my fame neither have seen my glory and they shall declare my glory among the gentiles and they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the lord out of all nations upon horses and in chariots and in litters and upon mules and upon swift beasts to my holy mountain jerusalem saith the lord as the children of israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the lord and i will also take of them for priests and for levites saith the lord for as the new heavens and the new earth which i will make shall remain before me saith the lord so shall your seed and your name remain and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me saith the lord and they shall go forth and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me for their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh
