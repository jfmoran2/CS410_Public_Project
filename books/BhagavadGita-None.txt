one the despondency of arjuna the king dhritarashtra asked o sanjaya what happened on the sacred battlefield of kurukshetra when my people gathered against the pandavas sanjaya replied the prince duryodhana when he saw the army of the pandavas paraded approached his preceptor guru drona and spoke as follows revered father behold this mighty host of the pandavas paraded by the son of king drupada thy wise disciple in it are heroes and great bowmen the equals in battle of arjuna and bheema yuyudhana virata and drupada great soldiers all dhrishtaketu chekitan the valiant king of benares purujit kuntibhoja shaibya a master over many yudhamanyu uttamouja soubhadra and the sons of droupadi famous men further take note of all those captains who have ranged themselves on our side o best of spiritual guides the leaders of my army i will name them for you you come first then bheeshma karna kripa great soldiers ashwaththama vikarna and the son of somadhatta and many others all ready to die for my sake all armed all skilled in war yet our army seems the weaker though commanded by bheeshma their army seems the stronger though commanded by bheema therefore in the rank and file let stand firm in their posts according to battalions and all you generals about bheeshma then to enliven his spirits the brave grandfather bheeshma eldest of the kuru clan blew his conch till it sounded like a lion s roar and immediately all the conches and drums the trumpets and horns blared forth in tumultuous uproar then seated in their spacious war chariot yoked with white horses lord shri krishna and arjuna sounded their divine shells lord shri krishna blew his panchajanya and arjuna his devadatta brave bheema his renowned shell poundra the king dharmaraja the son of kunti blew the anantavijaya nakalu and sahadeo the sugosh and manipushpaka respectively and the maharaja of benares the great archer shikhandi the great soldier dhrishtayumna virata and satyaki the invincible and o king drupada the sons of droupadi and soubhadra the great soldier blew their conches the tumult rent the hearts of the sons of dhritarashtra and violently shook heaven and earth with its echo then beholding the sons of dhritarashtra drawn up on the battle field ready to fight arjuna whose flag bore the hanuman raising his bow spoke this to the lord shri krishna o infallible lord of the earth please draw up my chariot betwixt the two armies so that i may observe those who must fight on my side those who must fight against me and gaze over this array of soldiers eager to please the sinful sons of dhritarashtra sanjaya said having listened to the request of arjuna lord shri krishna drew up his bright chariot exactly in the midst between the two armies whither bheeshma and drona had led all the rulers of the earth and spoke thus o arjuna behold these members of the family of kuru assembled there arjuna noticed fathers grandfathers uncles cousins sons grandsons teachers friends fathers in law and benefactors arrayed on both sides arjuna then gazed at all those kinsmen before him and his heart melted with pity and sadly he spoke o my lord when i see all these my own people thirsting for battle my limbs fail me and my throat is parched my body trembles and my hair stands on end the bow gandeeva slips from my hand and my skin burns i cannot keep quiet for my mind is in tumult the omens are adverse what good can come from the slaughter of my people on this battlefield ah my lord i crave not for victory nor for the kingdom nor for any pleasure what were a kingdom or happiness or life to me when those for whose sake i desire these things stand here about to sacrifice their property and their lives teachers fathers and grandfathers sons and grandsons uncles father in law brothers in law and other relatives i would not kill them even for three worlds why then for this poor earth it matters not if i myself am killed my lord what happiness can come from the death of these sons of dhritarashtra we shall sin if we kill these desperate men we are worthy of a nobler feat than to slaughter our relatives the sons of dhritarashtra for my lord how can we be happy of we kill our kinsmen although these men blinded by greed see no guilt in destroying their kin or fighting against their friends should not we whose eyes are open who consider it to be wrong to annihilate our house turn away from so great a crime the destruction of our kindred means the destruction of the traditions of our ancient lineage and when these are lost irreligion will overrun our homes when irreligion spreads the women of the house begin to stray when they lose their purity adulteration of the stock follows promiscuity ruins both the family and those who defile it while the souls of our ancestors droop through lack of the funeral cakes and ablutions by the destruction of our lineage and the pollution of blood ancient class traditions and family purity alike perish the wise say my lord that they are forever lost whose ancient traditions are lost alas it is strange that we should be willing to kill our own countrymen and commit a great sin in order to enjoy the pleasures of a kingdom if on the contrary the sons of dhritarashtra with weapons in their hand should slay me unarmed and unresisting surely that would be better for my welfare sanjaya said having spoken thus in the midst of the armies arjuna sank on the seat of the chariot casting away his bow and arrow heartbroken with grief thus in the holy book the bhagavad gita one of the upanishads in the science of the supreme spirit in the art of self knowledge in the colloquy between the divine lord shri krishna and the prince arjuna stands the first chapter entitled the despondency of arjuna two the philosophy of discrimination sanjaya then told how the lord shri krishna seeing arjuna overwhelmed with compassion his eyes dimmed with flowing tears and full of despondency consoled him the lord said my beloved friend why yield just on the eve of battle to this weakness which does no credit to those who call themselves aryans and only brings them infamy and bars against them the gates of heaven o arjuna why give way to unmanliness o thou who art the terror of thine enemies shake off such shameful effeminacy make ready to act arjuna argued my lord how can i when the battle rages send an arrow through bheeshma and drona who should receive my reverence rather would i content myself with a beggar s crust that kill these teachers of mine these precious noble souls to slay these masters who are my benefactors would be to stain the sweetness of life s pleasures with their blood nor can i say whether it were better that they conquer me or for me to conquer them since i would no longer care to live if i killed these sons of dhritarashtra now preparing for fight my heart is oppressed with pity and my mind confused as to what my duty is therefore my lord tell me what is best for my spiritual welfare for i am thy disciple please direct me i pray for should i attain the monarchy of the visible world or over the invisible world it would not drive away the anguish which is now paralysing my senses sanjaya continued arjuna the conqueror of all enemies then told the lord of all hearts that he would no fight and became silent o king thereupon the lord with a gracious smile addressed him who was so much depressed in the midst of the two armies lord shri krishna said why grieve for those for whom no grief is due and yet profess wisdom the wise grieve neither for the dead nor the living there was never a time when i was not nor thou nor these princes were not there will never be a time when we shall cease to be as the soul experiences in this body infancy youth and old age so finally it passes into another the wise have no delusion about this those external relations which bring cold and heat pain and happiness they come and go they are not permanent endure them bravely o prince the hero whose soul is unmoved by circumstance who accepts pleasure and pain with equanimity only he is fit for immortality that which is not shall never be that which is shall never cease to be to the wise these truths are self evident the spirit which pervades all that we see is imperishable nothing can destroy the spirit the material bodies which this eternal indestructible immeasurable spirit inhabits are all finite therefore fight o valiant man he who thinks that the spirit kills and he who thinks of it as killed are both ignorant the spirit kills not nor is it killed it was not born it will never die nor once having been can it cease to be unborn eternal ever enduring yet most ancient the spirit dies not when the body is dead he who knows the spirit as indestructible immortal unborn always the same how should he kill or cause to be killed as a man discards his threadbare robes and puts on new so the spirit throws off its worn out bodies and takes fresh ones weapons cleave it not fire burns it not water drenches it not and wind dries it not it is impenetrable it can be neither drowned nor scorched nor dried it is eternal all pervading unchanging immovable and most ancient it is named the unmanifest the unthinkable the immutable wherefore knowing the spirit as such thou hast no cause to grieve even if thou thinkest of it as constantly being born constantly dying even then o mighty man thou still hast no cause to grieve for death is as sure for that which is born as birth is for that which is dead therefore grieve not for what is inevitable the end and the beginning of beings are unknown we see only the intervening formations then what cause is there for grief one hears of the spirit with surprise another thinks it marvellous the third listens without comprehending thus though many are told about it scarcely is there one who knows it be not anxious about these armies the spirit in man is imperishable thou must look at thy duty nothing can be more welcome to a soldier than a righteous war therefore to waver in this resolve is unworthy o arjuna blessed are the soldiers who find their opportunity this opportunity has opened for thee the gates of heaven refuse to fight in this righteous cause and thou wilt be a traitor lost to fame incurring only sin men will talk forever of thy disgrace and to the noble dishonour is worse than death great generals will think that thou hast fled from the battlefield through cowardice though once honoured thou wilt seem despicable thine enemies will spread scandal and mock at thy courage can anything be more humiliating if killed thou shalt attain heaven if victorious enjoy the kingdom of earth therefore arise o son of kunti and fight look upon pleasure and pain victory and defeat with an equal eye make ready for the combat and thou shalt commit no sin i have told thee the philosophy of knowledge now listen and i will explain the philosophy of action by means of which o arjuna thou shalt break through the bondage of all action on this path endeavour is never wasted nor can it ever be repressed even a very little of its practice protects one from great danger by its means the straying intellect becomes steadied in the contemplation of one object only whereas the minds of the irresolute stray into bypaths innumerable only the ignorant speak in figurative language it is they who extol the letter of the scriptures saying there is nothing deeper than this consulting only their own desires they construct their own heaven devising arduous and complex rites to secure their own pleasure and their own power and the only result is rebirth while their minds are absorbed with ideas of power and personal enjoyment they cannot concentrate their discrimination on one point the vedic scriptures tell of the three constituents of life the qualities rise above all of them o arjuna above all the pairs of opposing sensations be steady in truth free from worldly anxieties and centered in the self as a man can drink water from any side of a full tank so the skilled theologian can wrest from any scripture that which will serve his purpose but thou hast only the right to work but none to the fruit thereof let not then the fruit of thy action be thy motive nor yet be thou enamored of inaction perform all thy actions with mind concentrated on the divine renouncing attachment and looking upon success and failure with an equal eye spirituality implies equanimity physical action is far inferior to an intellect concentrated on the divine have recourse then to pure intelligence it is only the petty minded who work for reward when a man attains to pure reason he renounces in this world the results of good and evil alike cling thou to right action spirituality is the real art of living the sages guided by pure intellect renounce the fruit of action and freed from the chains of rebirth they reach the highest bliss when thy reason has crossed the entanglements of illusion then shalt thou become indifferent both to the philosophies thou hast heard and to those thou mayest yet hear when the intellect bewildered by the multiplicity of holy scripts stands unperturbed in blissful contemplation of the infinite then hast thou attained spirituality arjuna asked my lord how can we recognise the saint who has attained pure intellect who has reached this state of bliss and whose mind is steady how does he talk how does he live and how does he act lord shri krishna replied when a man has given up the desires of his heart and is satisfied with the self alone be sure that he has reached the highest state the sage whose mind is unruffled in suffering whose desire is not roused by enjoyment who is without attachment anger or fear take him to be one who stands at that lofty level he who wherever he goes is attached to no person and to no place by ties of flesh who accepts good and evil alike neither welcoming the one nor shrinking from the other take him to be one who is merged in the infinite he who can withdraw his senses from the attraction of their objects as the tortoise draws his limbs within its shell take it that such a one has attained perfection the objects of sense turn from him who is abstemious even the relish for them is lost in him who has seen the truth o arjuna the mind of him who is trying to conquer it is forcibly carried away in spite of his efforts by his tumultuous senses restraining them all let him meditate steadfastly on me for who thus conquers his senses achieves perfection when a man dwells on the objects of sense he creates an attraction for them attraction develops into desire and desire breeds anger anger induces delusion delusion loss of memory through loss of memory reason is shattered and loss of reason leads to destruction but the self controlled soul who moves amongst sense objects free from either attachment or repulsion he wins eternal peace having attained peace he becomes free from misery for when the mind gains peace right discrimination follows right discrimination is not for him who cannot concentrate without concentration there cannot be meditation he who cannot meditate must not expect peace and without peace how can anyone expect happiness as a ship at sea is tossed by the tempest so the reason is carried away by the mind when preyed upon by straying senses therefore o might in arms he who keeps his senses detached from their objects take it that his reason is purified the saint is awake when the world sleeps and he ignores that for which the world lives he attains peace into whom desires flow as rivers into the ocean which though brimming with water remains ever the same not he whom desire carries away he attains peace who giving up desire moves through the world without aspiration possessing nothing which he can call his own and free from pride o arjuna this is the state of the self the supreme spirit to which if a man once attain it shall never be taken from him even at the time of leaving the body he will remain firmly enthroned there and will become one with the eternal thus in the holy book the bhagavad gita one of the upanishads in the science of the supreme spirit in the art of self knowledge in the colloquy between the divine lord shri krishna and the prince arjuna stands the second chapter entitled the philosophy of discrimination three karma yoga the path of action arjuna questioned my lord if wisdom is above action why dost thou advise me to engage in this terrible fight thy language perplexes me and confuses my reason therefore please tell me the only way by which i may without doubt secure my spiritual welfare lord shri krishna replied in this world as i have said there is a twofold path o sinless one there is the path of wisdom for those who meditate and the path of action for those who work no man can attain freedom from activity by refraining from action nor can he reach perfection by merely refusing to act he cannot even for a moment remain really inactive for the qualities of nature will compel him to act whether he will or no he who remains motionless refusing to act but all the while brooding over sensuous object that deluded soul is simply a hypocrite but o arjuna all honour to him whose mind controls his senses for he is thereby beginning to practise karma yoga the path of right action keeping himself always unattached do thy duty as prescribed for action for duty s sake is superior to inaction even the maintenance of the body would be impossible if man remained inactive in this world people are fettered by action unless it is performed as a sacrifice therefore o arjuna let thy acts be done without attachment as sacrifice only in the beginning when god created all beings by the sacrifice of himself he said unto them through sacrifice you can procreate and it shall satisfy all your desires worship the powers of nature thereby and let them nourish you in return thus supporting each other you shall attain your highest welfare for fed on sacrifice nature will give you all the enjoyment you can desire but he who enjoys what she gives without returning is indeed a robber the sages who enjoy the food that remains after the sacrifice is made are freed from all sin but the selfish who spread their feast only for themselves feed on sin only all creatures are the product of food food is the product of rain rain comes by sacrifice and sacrifice is the noblest form of action all action originates in the supreme spirit which is imperishable and in sacrificial action the all pervading spirit is consciously present thus he who does not help the revolving wheel of sacrifice but instead leads a sinful life rejoicing in the gratification of his senses o arjuna he breathes in vain on the other hand the soul who meditates on the self is content to serve the self and rests satisfied within the self there remains nothing more for him to accomplish he has nothing to gain by the performance or non performance of action his welfare depends not on any contribution that an earthly creature can make therefore do thy duty perfectly without care for the results for he who does his duty disinterestedly attains the supreme king janaka and others attained perfection through action alone even for the sake of enlightening the world it is thy duty to act for whatever a great man does others imitate people conform to the standard which he has set there is nothing in this universe o arjuna that i am compelled to do nor anything for me to attain yet i am persistently active for were i not to act without ceasing o prince people would be glad to do likewise and if i were to refrain from action the human race would be ruined i should lead the world to chaos and destruction would follow as the ignorant act because of their fondness for action so should the wise act without such attachment fixing their eyes o arjuna only on the welfare of the world but a wise man should not perturb the minds of the ignorant who are attached to action let him perform his own actions in the right spirit with concentration on me thus inspiring all to do the same action is the product of the qualities inherent in nature it is only the ignorant man who misled by personal egotism says i am the doer but he o mighty one who understands correctly the relation of the qualities to action is not attached to the act for he perceives that it is merely the action and reaction of the qualities among themselves those who do not understand the qualities are interested in the act still the wise man who knows the truth should not disturb the mind of him who does not therefore surrendering thy actions unto me thy thoughts concentrated on the absolute free from selfishness and without anticipation of reward with mind devoid of excitement begin thou to fight those who always act in accordance with my precepts firm in faith and without cavilling they too are freed from the bondage of action but they who ridicule my word and do not keep it are ignorant devoid of wisdom and blind they seek but their own destruction even the wise man acts in character with his nature indeed all creatures act according to their natures what is the use of compulsion then the love and hate which are aroused by the objects of sense arise from nature do not yield to them they only obstruct the path it is better to do thine own duty however lacking in merit than to do that of another even though efficiently it is better to die doing one s own duty for to do the duty of another is fraught with danger arjuna asked my lord tell me what is it that drives a man to sin even against his will and as if by compulsion lord shri krishna it is desire it is aversion born of passion desire consumes and corrupts everything it is man s greatest enemy as fire is shrouded in smoke a mirror by dust and a child by the womb so is the universe enveloped in desire it is the wise man s constant enemy it tarnishes the face of wisdom it is as insatiable as a flame of fire it works through the senses the mind and the reason and with their help destroys wisdom and confounds the soul therefore o arjuna first control thy senses and then slay desire for it is full of sin and is the destroyer of knowledge and of wisdom it is said that the senses are powerful but beyond the senses is the mind beyond the mind is the intellect and beyond and greater than intellect is he thus o mighty in arms knowing him to be beyond the intellect and by his help subduing thy personal egotism kill thine enemy desire extremely difficult though it be thus in the holy book the bhagavad gita one of the upanishads in the science of the supreme spirit in the art of self knowledge in the colloquy between the divine lord shri krishna and the prince arjuna stands the third chapter entitled karma yoga or the path of action four dnyana yoga the path of wisdom lord shri krishna said this imperishable philosophy i taught to viwaswana the founder of the sun dynasty viwaswana gave it to manu the lawgiver and manu to king ikshwaku the divine kings knew it for it was their tradition then after a long time at last it was forgotten it is the same ancient path that i have now revealed to thee since thou are my devotee and my friend it is the supreme secret arjuna asked my lord viwaswana was born before thee how then canst thou have revealed it to him lord shri krishna replied i have been born again and again from time to time thou too o arjuna my births are known to me but thou knowest not thine i have no beginning though i am imperishable as well as lord of all that exists yet by my own will and power do i manifest myself whenever spirituality decays and materialism is rampant then o arjuna i reincarnate myself to protect the righteous to destroy the wicked and to establish the kingdom of god i am reborn from age to age he who realises the divine truth concerning my birth and life is not born again and when he leaves his body he becomes one with me many have merged their existences in mine being freed from desire fear and anger filled always with me and purified by the illuminating flame of self abnegation howsoever men try to worship me so do i welcome them by whatever path they travel it leads to me at last those who look for success worship the powers and in this world their actions bear immediate fruit the four divisions of society the wise the soldier the merchant the labourer were created by me according to the natural distribution of qualities and instincts i am the author of them though i myself do no action and am changeless my actions do not fetter me nor do i desire anything that they can bring he who thus realises me is not enslaved by action in the light of wisdom our ancestors who sought deliverance performed their acts act thou also as did our fathers of old what is action and what is inaction it is a question which has bewildered the wise but i will declare unto thee the philosophy of action and knowing it thou shalt be free from evil it is necessary to consider what is right action what is wrong action and what is inaction for mysterious is the law of action he who can see inaction in action and action in inaction is the wisest among men he is a saint even though he still acts the wise call him a sage for whatever he undertakes is free from the motive of desire and his deeds are purified by the fire of wisdom having surrendered all claim to the results of his actions always contented and independent in reality he does nothing even though he is apparently acting expecting nothing his mind and personality controlled without greed doing bodily actions only though he acts yet he remains untainted content with what comes to him without effort of his own mounting above the pairs of opposites free from envy his mind balanced both in success and failure though he acts yet the consequences do not bind him he who is without attachment free his mind centered in wisdom his actions being done as a sacrifice leave no trace behind for him the sacrifice itself is the spirit the spirit and the oblation are one it is the spirit itself which is sacrificed in its own fire and the man even in action is united with god since while performing his act his mind never ceases to be fixed on him some sages sacrifice to the powers others offer themselves on the alter of the eternal some sacrifice their physical senses in the fire of self control others offer up their contact with external objects in the sacrificial fire of their senses other again sacrifice their activities and their vitality in the spiritual fire of self abnegation kindled by wisdom and yet others offer as their sacrifice wealth austerities and meditation monks wedded to their vows renounce their scriptural learning and even their spiritual powers there are some who practise control of the vital energy and govern the subtle forces of prana and apana thereby sacrificing their prana unto apana or their apana unto prana others controlling their diet sacrifice their worldly life to the spiritual fire all understand the principal of sacrifice and by its means their sins are washed away tasting the nectar of immortality as the reward of sacrifice they reach the eternal this world is not for those who refuse to sacrifice much less the other world in this way other sacrifices too may be undergone for the spirit s sake know thou that they all depend on action knowing this thou shalt be free the sacrifice of wisdom is superior to any material sacrifice for o arjuna the climax of action is always realisation this shalt thou learn by prostrating thyself at the master s feet by questioning him and by serving him the wise who have realised the truth will teach thee wisdom having known that thou shalt never again be confounded and o arjuna by the power of that wisdom thou shalt see all these people as if they were thine own self and therefore as me be thou the greatest of sinners yet thou shalt cross over all sin by the ferryboat of wisdom as the kindled fire consumes the fuel so o arjuna in the flame of wisdom the embers of action are burnt to ashes there is nothing in the world so purifying as wisdom and he who is a perfect saint finds that at last in his own self he who is full of faith attains wisdom and he too who can control his senses having attained that wisdom he shall ere long attain supreme peace but the ignorant man and he who has no faith and the sceptic are lost neither in this world nor elsewhere is there any happiness in store for him who always doubts but the man who has renounced his action for meditation who has cleft his doubt in twain by the sword of wisdom who remains always enthroned in his self is not bound by his acts therefore cleaving asunder with the sword of wisdom the doubts of the heart which thine own ignorance has engendered follow the path of wisdom and arise thus in the holy book the bhagavad gita one of the upanishads in the science of the supreme spirit in the art of self knowledge in the colloquy between the divine lord shri krishna and the prince arjuna stands the fourth chapter entitled dnyana yoga or the path of wisdom five the renunciation of action arjuna said my lord at one moment thou praisest renunciation of action at another right action tell me truly i pray which of these is the more conducive to my highest welfare lord shri krishna replied renunciation of action and the path of right action both lead to the highest of the two right action is the better he is a true ascetic who never desires or dislikes who is uninfluenced by the opposites and is easily freed from bondage only the unenlightened speak of wisdom and right action as separate not the wise if any man knows one he enjoys the fruit of both the level which is reached by wisdom is attained through right action as well he who perceives that the two are one knows the truth without concentration o mighty man renunciation is difficult but the sage who is always meditating on the divine before long shall attain the absolute he who is spiritual who is pure who has overcome his senses and his personal self who has realised his highest self as the self of all such a one even though he acts is not bound by his acts though the saint sees hears touches smells eats moves sleeps and breathes yet he knows the truth and he knows that it is not he who acts though he talks though he gives and receives though he opens his eyes and shuts them he still knows that his senses are merely disporting themselves among the objects of perception he who dedicates his actions to the spirit without any personal attachment to them he is no more tainted by sin than the water lily is wetted by water the sage performs his action dispassionately using his body mind and intellect and even his senses always as a means of purification having abandoned the fruit of action he wins eternal peace others unacquainted with spirituality led by desire and clinging to the benefit which they think will follow their actions become entangled in them mentally renouncing all actions the self controlled soul enjoys bliss in this body the city of the nine gates neither doing anything himself nor causing anything to be done the lord of this universe has not ordained activity or any incentive thereto or any relation between an act and its consequences all this is the work of nature the lord does not accept responsibility for any man s sin or merit men are deluded because in them wisdom is submerged in ignorance surely wisdom is like the sun revealing the supreme truth to those whose ignorance is dispelled by the wisdom of the self meditating on the divine having faith in the divine concentrating on the divine and losing themselves in the divine their sins dissolved in wisdom they go whence there is no return sages look equally upon all whether he be a minister of learning and humility or an infidel or whether it be a cow an elephant or a dog even in this world they conquer their earth life whose minds fixed on the supreme remain always balanced for the supreme has neither blemish nor bias he who knows and lives in the absolute remains unmoved and unperturbed he is not elated by pleasure or depressed by pain he finds happiness in his own self and enjoys eternal bliss whose heart does not yearn for the contacts of earth and whose self is one with the everlasting the joys that spring from external associations bring pain they have their beginning and their endings the wise man does not rejoice in them he who before he leaves his body learns to surmount the promptings of desire and anger is a saint and is happy he who is happy within his self and has found its peace and in whom the inner light shines that sage attains eternal bliss and becomes the spirit itself sages whose sins have been washed away whose sense of separateness has vanished who have subdued themselves and seek only the welfare of all come to the eternal spirit saints who know their selves who control their minds and feel neither desire nor anger find eternal bliss everywhere excluding external objects his gaze fixed between the eyebrows the inward and outward breathings passing equally through his nostrils governing sense mind and intellect intent on liberation free from desire fear and anger the sage is forever free knowing me as him who gladly receives all offerings of austerity and sacrifice as the might ruler of all the worlds and the friend of all beings he passes to eternal peace thus in the holy book the bhagavad gita one of the upanishads in the science of the supreme spirit in the art of self knowledge in the colloquy between the divine lord shri krishna and the prince arjuna stands the fifth chapter entitled the renunciation of action six self control lord shri krishna said he who acts because it is his duty not thinking of the consequences is really spiritual and a true ascetic and not he who merely observes rituals or who shuns all action o arjuna renunciation is in fact what is called right action no one can become spiritual who has not renounced all desire for the sage who seeks the heights of spiritual meditation practice is the only method and when he has attained them he must maintain himself there by continual self control when a man renounces even the thought of initiating action when he is not interested in sense objects or any results which may flow from his acts then in truth he understands spirituality let him seek liberation by the help of his highest self and let him never disgrace his own self for that self is his only friend yet it may also be his enemy to him who has conquered his lower nature by its help the self is a friend but to him who has not done so it is an enemy the self of him who is self controlled and has attained peace is equally unmoved by heat or cold pleasure or pain honour or dishonour he who desires nothing but wisdom and spiritual insight who has conquered his senses and who looks with the same eye upon a lump of earth a stone or fine gold is a real saint he looks impartially on all lover friend or foe indifferent or hostile alien or relative virtuous or sinful let the student of spirituality try unceasingly to concentrate his mind let him live in seclusion absolutely alone with mind and personality controlled free from desire and without possessions having chosen a holy place let him sit in a firm posture on a seat neither too high nor too low and covered with a grass mat a deer skin and a cloth seated thus his mind concentrated its functions controlled and his senses governed let him practise meditation for the purification of his lower nature let him hold body head and neck erect motionless and steady let him look fixedly at the tip of his nose turning neither to the right nor to the left with peace in his heart and nor fear observing the vow of celibacy with mind controlled and fixed on me let the student lose himself in contemplation of me thus keeping his mind always in communion with me and with his thoughts subdued he shall attain that peace which is mine and which will lead him to liberation at last meditation is not for him who eats too much not for him who eats not at all not for him who is overmuch addicted to sleep not for him who is always awake but for him who regulates his food and recreation who is balanced in action in sleep and in waking it shall dispel all unhappiness when the mind completely controlled is centered in the self and free from all earthly desires then is the man truly spiritual the wise man who has conquered his mind and is absorbed in the self is as a lamp which does not flicker since it stands sheltered from every wind there where the whole nature is seen in the light of the self where the man abides within his self and is satisfied there its functions restrained by its union with the divine the mind finds rest when he enjoys the bliss which passes sense and which only the pure intellect can grasp when he comes to rest within his own highest self never again will he stray from reality finding that he will realise that there is no possession so precious and when once established here no calamity can disturb him this inner severance from the affliction of misery is spirituality it should be practised with determination and with a heart which refuses to be depressed renouncing every desire which imagination can conceive controlling the senses at every point by the power of mind little by little by the help of his reason controlled by fortitude let him attain peace and fixing his mind on the self let him not think of any other thing when the volatile and wavering mind would wander let him restrain it and bring it again to its allegiance to the self supreme bliss is the lot of the sage whose mind attains peace whose passions subside who is without sin and who becomes one with the absolute thus free from sin abiding always in the eternal the saint enjoys without effort the bliss which flows from realisation of the infinite he who experiences the unity of life sees his own self in all beings and all beings in his own self and looks on everything with an impartial eye he who sees me in everything and everything in me him shall i never forsake nor shall he lose me the sage who realises the unity of life and who worships me in all beings lives in me whatever may be his lot o arjuna he is the perfect saint who taught by the likeness within himself sees the same self everywhere whether the outer form be pleasurable or painful arjuna said i do not see how i can attain this state of equanimity which thou has revealed owing to the restlessness of my mind my lord verily the mind is fickle and turbulent obstinate and strong yea extremely difficult as the wind to control lord shri krishna replied doubtless o mighty one the mind is fickle and exceedingly difficult to restrain but o son of kunti with practice and renunciation it can be done it is not possible to attain self realisation if a man does not know how to control himself but for him who striving by proper means learns such control it is possible arjuna asked he who fails to control himself whose mind falls from spiritual contemplation who attains not perfection but retains his faith what of him my lord having failed in both my lord is he without hope like a riven cloud having no support lost on the spiritual road my lord thou art worthy to solve this doubt once and for all save thyself there is no one competent to do so lord shri krishna replied my beloved child there is no destruction for him either in this world or in the next no evil fate awaits him who treads the path of righteousness having reached the worlds where the righteous dwell and having remained there for many years he who has slipped from the path of spirituality will be born again in the family of the pure benevolent and prosperous or he may be born in the family of the wise sages though a birth like this is indeed very difficult to obtain then the experience acquired in his former life will revive and with its help he will strive for perfection more eagerly than before unconsciously he will return to the practices of his old life so that he who tries to realise spiritual consciousness is certainly superior to one who only talks of it then after many lives the student of spirituality who earnestly strives and whose sins are absolved attains perfection and reaches the supreme the wise man is superior to the ascetic and to the scholar and to the man of action therefore be thou a wise man o arjuna i look upon him as the best of mystics who full of faith worshippeth me and abideth in me thus in the holy book the bhagavad gita one of the upanishads in the science of the supreme spirit in the art of self knowledge in the colloquy between the divine lord shri krishna and the prince arjuna stands the sixth chapter entitled self control seven knowledge and experience lord shri krishna said listen o arjuna and i will tell thee how thou shalt know me in my full perfection practising meditation with thy mind devoted to me and having me for thy refuge i will reveal to this knowledge unto thee and how it may be realised which once accomplished there remains nothing else worth having in this life among thousands of men scarcely one strives for perfection and even amongst those who gain occult powers perchance but one knows me in truth earth water fire air ether mind intellect and personality this is the eightfold division of my manifested nature this is my inferior nature but distinct from this o valiant one know thou that my superior nature is the very life which sustains the universe it is the womb of all being for i am he by whom the worlds were created and shall be dissolved o arjuna there is nothing higher than me all is strung upon me as rows of pearls upon a thread o arjuna i am the fluidity in water the light in the sun and in the moon i am the mystic syllable om in the vedic scriptures the sound in ether the virility in man i am the fragrance of earth the brilliance of fire i am the life force in all beings and i am the austerity of the ascetics know o arjuna that i am the eternal seed of being i am the intelligence of the intelligent the splendour of the resplendent i am the strength of the strong of them who are free from attachment and desire and o arjuna i am the desire for righteousness whatever be the nature of their life whether it be pure or passionate or ignorant they are all derived from me they are in me but i am not in them the inhabitants of the world misled by those natures which the qualities have engendered know not that i am higher than them all and that i do not change verily this divine illusion of phenomenon manifesting itself in the qualities is difficult to surmount only they who devote themselves to me and to me alone can accomplish it the sinner the ignorant the vile deprived of spiritual perception by the glamour of illusion and he who pursues a godless life none of them shall find me o arjuna the righteous who worship me are grouped by stages first they who suffer next they who desire knowledge then they who thirst after truth and lastly they who attain wisdom of all of these he who has gained wisdom who meditates on me without ceasing devoting himself only to me he is the best for by the wise man i am exceedingly beloved and the wise man too is beloved by me noble minded are they all but the wise man i hold as my own self for he remaining always at peace with me makes me his final goal after many lives at last the wise man realises me as i am a man so enlightened that he sees god everywhere is very difficult to find they in whom wisdom is obscured by one desire or the other worship the lesser powers practising many rites which vary according to their temperaments but whatever the form of worship if the devotee have faith then upon his faith in that worship do i set my own seal if he worships one form alone with real faith then shall his desires be fulfilled through that only for thus have i ordained the fruit that comes to men of limited insight is after all finite they who worship the lower powers attain them but those who worship me come unto me alone the ignorant think of me who am the unmanifested spirit as if i were really in human form they do not understand that my superior nature is changeless and most excellent i am not visible to all for i am enveloped by the illusion of phenomenon this deluded world does not know me as the unborn and the imperishable i know o arjuna all beings in the past the present and the future but they do not know me o brave arjuna man lives in a fairy world deceived by the glamour of opposite sensations infatuated by desire and aversion but those who act righteously in whom sin has been destroyed who are free from the infatuation of the conflicting emotions they worship me with firm resolution those who make me their refuge who strive for liberation from decay and death they realise the supreme spirit which is their own real self and in which all action finds its consummation those who see me in the life of the world in the universal sacrifice and as pure divinity keeping their minds steady they live in me even in the crucial hour of death thus in the holy book the bhagavad gita one of the upanishads in the science of the supreme spirit in the art of self knowledge in the colloquy between the divine lord shri krishna and the prince arjuna stand the seventh chapter entitled knowledge and experience eight life everlasting arjuna asked o lord of lords what is that which men call the supreme spirit what is man s spiritual nature and what is the law what is matter and what is divinity who is it who rules the spirit sacrifice in many and at the time of death how may those who have learned self control come to the knowledge of thee the lord shri krishna replied the supreme spirit is the highest imperishable self and its nature is spiritual consciousness the worlds have been created and are supported by an emanation from the spirit which is called the law matter consists of the forms that perish divinity is the supreme self and he who inspires the spirit of sacrifice in man o noblest of thy race is i myself who now stand in human form before thee whosoever at the time of death thinks only of me and thinking thus leaves the body and goes forth assuredly he will know me on whatever sphere of being the mind of a man may be intent at the time of death thither he will go therefore meditate always on me and fight if thy mind and thy reason be fixed on me to me shalt thou surely come he whose mind does not wander and who is engaged in constant meditation attains the supreme spirit whoso meditates on the omniscient the ancient more minute than the atom yet the ruler and upholder of all unimaginable brilliant like the sun beyond the reach of darkness he who leaves the body with mind unmoved and filled with devotion by the power of his meditation gathering between his eyebrows his whole vital energy attains the supreme now i will speak briefly of the imperishable goal proclaimed by those versed in the scriptures which the mystic attains when free from passion and for which he is content to undergo the vow of continence closing the gates of the body drawing the forces of his mind into the heart and by the power of meditation concentrating his vital energy in the brain repeating om the symbol of eternity holding me always in remembrance he who thus leaves his body and goes forth reaches the spirit supreme to him who thinks constantly of me and of nothing else to such an ever faithful devotee o arjuna am i ever accessible coming thus unto me these great souls go no more to the misery and death of earthly life for they have gained perfection the worlds with the whole realm of creation come and go but o arjuna whoso comes to me for him there is nor rebirth those who understand the cosmic day and cosmic night know that one day of creation is a thousand cycles and that the night is of equal length at the dawning of that day all objects in manifestation stream forth from the unmanifest and when evening falls they are dissolved into it again the same multitude of beings which have lived on earth so often all are dissolved as the night of the universe approaches to issue forth anew when morning breaks thus is it ordained in truth therefore there is the eternal unmanifest which is beyond and above the unmanifest spirit of creation which is never destroyed when all these being perish the wise say that the unmanifest and indestructible is the highest goal of all when once that is reached there is no return that is my blessed home o arjuna that highest god in whom all beings abide and who pervades the entire universe is reached only by wholehearted devotion the following material between the asterisks is an example of what may be a doctored inclusion it does not jibe with the rest of the material because it is not presented as metaphor and clearly implies that worldly phenomena are spiritually determining maybe it was added by an individual or individuals who were less cognizant than the originating author or maybe was craftily inserted to function as a sort of litmus test those who get taken in by it may be recognized as not having spiritual discernment now i will tell thee o arjuna of the times at which if the mystics go forth they do not return and at which they go forth only to return if knowing the supreme spirit the sage goes forth with fire and light in the daytime in the fortnight of the waxing moon and in the six months before the northern summer solstice he will attain the supreme but if he departs in gloom at night during the fortnight of the waning moon and in the six months before the southern solstice then he reaches but lunar light and he will be born again these bright and dark paths out of the world have always existed whoso takes the former returns not he who chooses the latter returns o arjuna the saint knowing these paths is not confused therefore meditate perpetually the sage who knows this passes beyond all merit that comes from the study of the scriptures from sacrifice from austerities and charity and reaches the supreme primeval abode thus in the holy book the bhagavad gita one of the upanishads in the science of the supreme spirit in the art of self knowledge in the colloquy between the divine lord shri krishna and the prince arjuna stand the eight chapter entitled the life everlasting nine the science of sciences and the mystery of mysteries lord shri krishna said i will now reveal to thee since thou doubtest not that profound mysticism which when followed by experience shall liberate thee from sin this is the premier science the sovereign secret the purest and best intuitional righteous and to him who practiseth it pleasant beyond measure they who have no faith in this teaching cannot find me but remain lost in the purlieus of this perishable world the whole world is pervaded by me yet my form is not seen all living things have their being in me yet i am not limited by them nevertheless they do not consciously abide in me such is my divine sovereignty that though i the supreme self am the cause and upholder of all yet i remain outside as the mighty wind though moving everywhere has no resting place but space so have all these beings no home but me all beings o arjuna return at the close of every cosmic cycle into the realm of nature which is a part of me and at the beginning of the next i send them forth again with the help of nature again and again i pour forth the whole multitude of beings whether they will or no for they are ruled by my will but these acts of mine do not bind me i remain outside and unattached under my guidance nature produces all things movable and immovable thus it is o arjuna that this universe revolves fools disregard me seeing me clad in human form they know not that in my higher nature i am the lord god of all their hopes are vain their actions worthless their knowledge futile they are without sense deceitful barbarous and godless but the great souls o arjuna filled with my divine spirit they worship me they fix their minds on me and on me alone for they know that i am the imperishable source of being always extolling me strenuous firm in their vows prostrating themselves before me they worship me continually with concentrated devotion others worship me with full consciousness as the one the manifold the omnipresent the universal i am the oblation the sacrifice and the worship i am the fuel and the chant i am the butter offered to the fire i am the fire itself and i am the act of offering i am the father of the universe and its mother i am its nourisher and its grandfather i am the knowable and the pure i am om and i am the sacred scriptures i am the goal the sustainer the lord the witness the home the shelter the lover and the origin i am life and death i am the fountain and the seed imperishable i am the heat of the sun i release and hold back the rains i am death and immortality i am being and not being those who are versed in the scriptures who drink the mystic soma juice and are purified from sin but who while worshipping me with sacrifices pray that i will lead them to heaven they reach the holy world where lives the controller of the powers of nature and they enjoy the feasts of paradise yet although they enjoy the spacious glories of paradise nevertheless when their merit is exhausted they are born again into this world of mortals they have followed the letter of the scriptures yet because they have sought but to fulfill their own desires they must depart and return again and again but if a man will meditate on me and me alone and will worship me always and everywhere i will take upon myself the fulfillment of his aspiration and i will safeguard whatsoever he shall attain even those who worship the lesser powers if they do so with faith they thereby worship me though not in the right way i am the willing recipient of sacrifice and i am its true lord but these do not know me in truth and so they sink back the votaries of the lesser powers go to them the devotees of spirits go to them they who worship the powers of darkness to such powers shall they go and so too those who worship me shall come to me whatever a man offers to me whether it be a leaf or a flower of fruit or water i accept it for it is offered with devotion and purity of mind whatever thou doest whatever thou dost eat whatever thou dost sacrifice and give whatever austerities thou practisest do all as an offering to me so shall thy action be attended by no result either good or bad but through the spirit of renunciation thou shalt come to me and be free i am the same to all beings i favour none and i hate none but those who worship me devotedly they live in me and i in them even the most sinful if he worship me with his whole heart shalt be considered righteous for he is treading the right path he shall attain spirituality ere long and eternal peace shall be his o arjuna believe me my devotee is never lost for even the children of sinful parents and those miscalled the weaker sex and merchants and labourers if only they will make me their refuge they shall attain the highest what need then to mention the holy ministers of god the devotees and the saintly rulers do thou therefore born in this changing and miserable world do thou too worship me fix thy mind on me devote thyself to me sacrifice for me surrender to me make me the object of thy aspirations and thou shalt assuredly become one with me who am thine own self thus in the holy book the bhagavad gita one of the upanishads in the science of the supreme spirit in the art of self knowledge in the colloquy between the divine lord shri krishna and the prince arjuna stands the ninth chapter entitled the science of sciences and the mystery of mysteries ten the divine manifestations lord shri krishna said now o prince listen to my supreme advice which i give thee for the sake of thy welfare for thou art my beloved neither the professors of divinity nor the great ascetics know my origin for i am the source of them all he who knows me as the unborn without beginning the lord of the universe he stripped of his delusion becomes free from all conceivable sin intelligence wisdom non illusion forgiveness truth self control calmness pleasure pain birth death fear and fearlessness harmlessness equanimity contentment austerity beneficence fame and failure all these the characteristics of beings spring from me only the seven great seers the progenitors of mankind the ancient four and the lawgivers were born of my will and come forth direct from me the race of mankind has sprung from them mareechi atri angira pulah kratu pulastya vahishta the masters sanak sanandan sanatan sanatkumar he who rightly understands my manifested glory and my creative power beyond doubt attains perfect peace i am the source of all from me everything flows therefore the wise worship me with unchanging devotion with minds concentrated on me with lives absorbed in me and enlightening each other they ever feel content and happy to those who are always devout and who worship me with love i give the power of discrimination which leads them to me by my grace i live in their hearts and i dispel the darkness of ignorance by the shining light of wisdom arjuna asked thou art the supreme spirit the eternal home the holiest of the holy the eternal divine self the primal god the unborn and the omnipresent so have said the seers and the divine sage narada as well as asita devala and vyasa and thou thyself also sayest it i believe in what thou hast said my lord for neither the godly not the godless comprehend thy manifestation thou alone knowest thyself by the power of thy self thou the supreme spirit the source and master of all being the lord of lords the ruler of the universe please tell me all about thy glorious manifestations by means of which thou pervadest the world o master how shall i by constant meditation know thee my lord what are thy various manifestations through which i am to mediate on thee tell me again i pray about the fullness of thy power and thy glory for i feel that i am never satisfied when i listen to thy immortal words lord shri krishna replied so be it my beloved fried i will unfold to thee some of the chief aspects of my glory of its full extent there is no end o

crocodile among the fishes and i am the ganges among rivers i am the beginning the middle and the end in creation among sciences i am the science of spirituality i am the discussion among disputants

i am shukracharya among the sages i am the sceptre of rulers the strategy of the conquerors the silence of mystery the wisdom of the wise i am the seed of all being o arjuna no creature moving or unmoving can live without me o arjuna the aspects of my divine life are endless i have mentioned but a few by way of illustration whatever is glorious excellent beautiful and mighty be assured that it comes from a fragment of my splendour but what is the use of all these details to thee o arjuna i sustain this universe with only small part of myself thus in the holy book the bhagavad gita one of the upanishads in the science of the supreme spirit in the art of self knowledge in the colloquy between the divine lord shri krishna and the prince arjuna stands the tenth chapter entitled the divine manifestations eleven the cosmic vision arjuna said my lord thy words concerning the supreme secret of self given for my blessing have dispelled the illusions which surrounded me o lord whose eyes are like the lotus petal thou hast described in detail the origin and the dissolution of being and thine own eternal majesty i believe all as thou hast declared it i long now to have a vision of thy divine form o thou most high if thou thinkest that it can be made possible for me to see it show me o lord of lords thine own eternal self lord shri krishna replied behold o arjuna my celestial forms by hundred and thousands various in kind in colour and in shape behold thou the powers of nature fire earth wind and sky the sun the heavens the moon the stars all forces of vitality and of healing and the roving winds see the myriad wonders revealed to none but thee here in me living as one o arjuna behold the whole universe movable and immovable and anything else that thou wouldst see yet since with mortal eyes thou canst not see me lo i give thee the divine sight see now the glory of my sovereignty sanjaya continued having thus spoken o king the lord shri krishna the almighty prince of wisdom showed to arjuna the supreme form of the great god there were countless eyes and mouths and mystic forms innumerable with shining ornaments and flaming celestial weapons crowned with heavenly garlands clothed in shining garments anointed with divine unctions he showed himself as the resplendent one marvellous boundless omnipresent could a thousand suns blaze forth together it would be but a faint reflection of the radiance of the lord god in that vision arjuna saw the universe with its manifold shapes all embraced in one its supreme lord thereupon arjuna dumb with awe his hair on end his head bowed his hands clasped in salutation addressed the lord thus arjuna said o almighty god i see in thee the powers of nature the various creatures of the world the progenitor on his lotus throne the sages and the shining angels i see thee infinite in form with as it were faces eyes and limbs everywhere no beginning no middle no end o thou lord of the universe whose form is universal i see thee with the crown the sceptre and the discus a blaze of splendour scarce can i gaze on thee so radiant thou art glowing like the blazing fire brilliant as the sun immeasurable imperishable art thou the sole one worthy to be known the priceless treasure house of the universe the immortal guardian of the life eternal the spirit everlasting without beginning without middle and without end infinite in power thine arms all embracing the sun and moon thine eyes thy face beaming with the fire of sacrifice flooding the whole universe with light alone thou fillest all the quarters of the sky earth and heaven and the regions between o almighty lord seeing thy marvellous and awe inspiring form the spheres tremble with fear the troops of celestial beings enter into thee some invoking thee in fear with folded palms the great seers and adepts sing hymns to thy glory saying all hail the vital forces the major stars fire earth air sky sun heaven moon and planets the angels the guardians of the universe the divine healers the winds the fathers the heavenly singers and hosts of mammon worshippers demons as well as saints are amazed seeing thy stupendous form o most mighty with its myriad faces its innumerable eyes and limbs and terrible jaws i myself and all the worlds are overwhelmed with awe when i see thee touching the heavens glowing with colour with open mouth and wide open fiery eyes i am terrified o my lord my courage and peace of mind desert me when i see thy mouths with their fearful jaws like glowing fires at the dissolution of creation i lose all sense of place i find no rest be merciful o lord in whom this universe abides all these sons of dhritarashtra with the hosts of princes bheeshma drona and karna as well as the other warrior chiefs belonging to our side i see them all rushing headlong into thy mouths with terrible tusks horrible to behold some are mangled between thy jaws with their heads crushed to atoms as rivers in flood surge furiously to the ocean so these heroes the greatest among men fling themselves into thy flaming mouths as moths fly impetuously to the flame only to be killed so these men rush into thy mouths to court their own destruction thou seemest to swallow up the worlds to lap them in flame thy glory fills the universe thy fierce rays beat down upon it irresistibly tell me then who thou art that wearest this dreadful form i bow before thee o mighty one have mercy i pray and let me see thee as thou wert at first i do not know what thou intendest lord shri krishna replied i have shown myself to thee as the destroyer who lays waste the world and whose purpose is destruction in spite of thy efforts all these warriors gathered for battle shall not escape death then gird up thy loins and conquer subdue thy foes and enjoy the kingdom in prosperity i have already doomed them be thou my instrument arjuna drona and bheeshma jayadratha and karna and other brave warriors i have condemned them all destroy them fight and fear not thy foes shall be crushed sanjaya continued having heard these words from the lord shri krishna the prince arjuna with folded hands trembling prostrated himself and with choking voice bowing down again and again and overwhelmed with awe once more addressed the lord arjuna said my lord it is natural that the world revels and rejoices when it sings the praises of thy glory the demons fly in fear and the saints offer thee their salutations how should they do otherwise o thou supremest self greater than the powers of creation the first cause infinite the lord of lords the home of the universe imperishable being and not being yet transcending both thou art the primal god the ancient the supreme abode of this universe the knower the knowledge and the final home thou fillest everything thy form is infinite thou art the wind thou art death thou art the fire the water the moon the father and the grandfather honour and glory to thee a thousand and a thousand times again and again salutation be to thee o my lord salutations to thee in front and on every side thou who encompasseth me round about thy power is infinite thy majesty immeasurable thou upholdest all things yea thou thyself art all whatever i have said unto thee in rashness taking thee only for a friend and addressing thee as o krishna o yadava o friend in thoughtless familiarity no understanding thy greatness whatever insult i have offered to thee in jest in sport or in repose in conversation or at the banquet alone or in a multitude i ask thy forgiveness for them all o thou who art without an equal for thou art the father of all things movable and immovable the worshipful the master of masters in all the worlds there is none equal to thee how then superior o thou who standeth alone supreme therefore i prostrate myself before thee o lord most adorable i salute thee i ask thy blessing only thou canst be trusted to bear with me as father to son as friend to friend as lover to his beloved i rejoice that i have seen what never man saw before yet o lord i am overwhelmed with fear please take again the form i know be merciful o lord thou who are the home of the whole universe i long to see thee as thou wert before with the crown the sceptre and the discus in thy hands in thy other form with thy four hands o thou whose arms are countless and whose forms are infinite lord shri krishna replied my beloved friend it is only through my grace and power that thou hast been able to see this vision of splendour the universal the infinite the original never has it been seen by any but thee not by study of the scriptures not by sacrifice or gift not by ritual or rigorous austerity is it possible for man on earth to see what thou hast seen o thou foremost hero of the kuru clan be not afraid or bewildered by the terrible vision put away thy fear and with joyful mind see me once again in my usual form sanjaya continued having thus spoken to arjuna lord shri krishna showed himself again in his accustomed form and the mighty lord in gentle tones softly consoled him who lately trembled with fear arjuna said seeing thee in thy gentle human form my lord i am myself again calm once more lord shri krishna replied it is hard to see this vision of me that thou hast seen even the most powerful have longed for it in vain not by study of the scriptures or by austerities not by gifts or sacrifices is it possible to see me as thou hast done only by tireless devotion can i be seen and known only thus can a man become one with me o arjuna he whose every action is done for my sake to whom i am the final goal who loves me only and hates no one o my dearest son only he can realize me thus in the holy book the bhagavad gita one of the upanishads in the science of the supreme spirit in the art of self knowledge in the colloquy between the divine lord shri krishna and the prince arjuna stands the eleventh chapter entitled the cosmic vision twelve bhakti yoga the path of love arjuna asked my lord which are the better devotees who worship thee those who try to know thee as a personal god or those who worship thee as impersonal and indestructible lord shri krishna replied those who keep their minds fixed on me who worship me always with unwavering faith and concentration these are the very best those who worship me as the indestructible the undefinable the omnipresent the unthinkable the primeval the immutable and the eternal subduing their senses viewing all conditions of life with the same eye and working for the welfare of all beings assuredly they come to me but they who thus fix their attention on the absolute and impersonal encounter greater hardships for it is difficult for those who possess a body to realise me as without one verily those who surrender their actions to me who muse on me worship me and meditate on me alone with no thought save of me o arjuna i rescue them from the ocean of life and death for their minds are fixed on me then let thy mind cling only to me let thy intellect abide in me and without doubt thou shalt live hereafter in me alone but if thou canst not fix thy mind firmly on me then my beloved friend try to do so by constant practice and if thou are not strong enough to practise concentration then devote thyself to my service do all thine acts for my sake and thou shalt still attain the goal and if thou art too weak even for this then seek refuge in union with me and with perfect self control renounce the fruit of thy action knowledge is superior to blind action meditation to mere knowledge renunciation of the fruit of action to meditation and where there is renunciation peace will follow he who is incapable of hatred towards any being who is kind and compassionate free from selfishness without pride equable in pleasure and in pain and forgiving always contented self centred self controlled resolute with mind and reason dedicated to me such a devotee of mine is my beloved he who does not harm the world and whom the world cannot harm who is not carried away by any impulse of joy anger or fear such a one is my beloved he who expects nothing who is pure watchful indifferent unruffled and who renounces all initiative such a one is my beloved he who is beyond joy and hate who neither laments nor desires to whom good and evil fortunes are the same such a one is my beloved he to whom friend and foe are alike who welcomes equally honour and dishonour heat and cold pleasure and pain who is enamoured of nothing who is indifferent to praise and censure who enjoys silence who is contented with every fate who has no fixed abode who is steadfast in mind and filled with devotion such a one is my beloved verily those who love the spiritual wisdom as i have taught whose faith never fails and who concentrate their whole nature on me they indeed are my most beloved thus in the holy book the bhagavad gita one of the upanishads in the science of the supreme spirit in the art of self knowledge in the colloquy between the divine lord shri krishna and the prince arjuna stands the twelfth chapter entitled bhakti yoga or the path of love thirteen spirit and matter arjuna asked my lord who is god and what is nature what is matter and what is the self what is that they call wisdom and what is it that is worth knowing i wish to have this explained lord shri krishna replied o arjuna the body of man is the playground of the self and that which knows the activities of matter sages call the self i am the omniscient self that abides in the playground of matter knowledge of matter and of the all knowing self is wisdom what is called matter of what it is composed whence it came and why it changes what the self is and what its power this i will now briefly set forth seers have sung of it in various ways in many hymns and sacred vedic songs weighty in thought and convincing in argument the five great fundamentals earth fire air water and ether personality intellect the mysterious life force the ten organs of perception and action the mind and the five domains of sensation desire aversion pleasure pain sympathy vitality and the persistent clinging to life these are in brief the constituents of changing matter humility sincerity harmlessness forgiveness rectitude service of the master purity steadfastness self control renunciation of the delights of sense absence of pride right understanding of the painful problem of birth and death of age and sickness indifference non attachment to sex progeny or home equanimity in good fortune and in bad unswerving devotion to me by concentration on me and me alone a love for solitude indifference to social life constant yearning for the knowledge of self and pondering over the lessons of the great truth this is wisdom all else ignorance i will speak to thee now of that great truth which man ought to know since by its means he will win immortal bliss that which is without beginning the eternal spirit which dwells in me neither with form nor yet without it everywhere are its hands and its feet everywhere it has eyes that see heads that think and mouths that speak everywhere it listens it dwells in all the worlds it envelops them all beyond the senses it yet shines through every sense perception bound to nothing it yet sustains everything unaffected by the qualities it still enjoys them all it is within all beings yet outside motionless yet moving too subtle to be perceived far away yet always near in all beings undivided yet living in division it is the upholder of all creator and destroyer alike it is the light of lights beyond the reach of darkness the wisdom the only thing that is worth knowing or that wisdom can teach the presence in the hearts of all thus i have told thee in brief what matter is and the self worth realising and what is wisdom he who is devoted to me knows and assuredly he will enter into me know thou further that nature and god have no beginning and that differences of character and quality have their origin in nature only nature is the law which generates cause and effect god is the source of the enjoyment of all pleasure and pain god dwelling in the heart of nature experiences the qualities which nature brings forth and his affinity towards the qualities is the reason for his living in a good or evil body thus in the body of man dwells the supreme god he who sees and permits upholds and enjoys the highest god and the highest self he who understands god and nature along with her qualities whatever be his condition in life he comes not again to earth some realise the supreme by meditating by its aid on the self within others by pure reason others by right action others again having no direct knowledge but only hearing from others nevertheless worship and they too if true to the teachings cross the sea of death wherever life is seen in things movable or immovable it is the joint product of matter and spirit he who can see the supreme lord in all beings the imperishable amidst the perishable he it is who really sees beholding the lord in all things equally his actions do not mar his spiritual life but lead him to the height of bliss he who understands that it is only the law of nature that brings action to fruition and that the self never acts alone knows the truth he who sees the diverse forms of life all rooted in one and growing forth from him he shall indeed find the absolute the supreme spirit o prince is without beginning without qualities and imperishable and though it be within the body yet it does not act nor is it affected by action as space though present everywhere remains by reason of its subtlety unaffected so the self though present in all forms retains its purity unalloyed as the one sun illuminates the whole earth so the lord illumines the whole universe those who with the eyes of wisdom thus see the difference between matter and spirit and know how to liberate life from the law of nature they attain the supreme thus in the holy book the bhagavad gita one of the upanishads in the science of the supreme spirit in the art of self knowledge in the colloquy between the divine lord shri krishna and the prince arjuna stands the thirteenth chapter entitled spirit and matter fourteen the three qualities lord shri krishna continued now i will reveal unto the wisdom which is beyond knowledge by attaining which the sages have reached perfection dwelling in wisdom and realising my divinity they are not born again when the universe is re created at the beginning of every cycle nor are they affected when it is dissolved the eternal cosmos is my womb in which i plant the seed from which all beings are born o prince o illustrious son of kunti through whatever wombs men are born it is the spirit itself that conceives and i am their father purity passion and ignorance are the qualities which the law of nature bringeth forth they fetter the free spirit in all beings o sinless one of these purity being luminous strong and invulnerable binds one by its yearning for happiness and illumination passion engendered by thirst for pleasure and attachment binds the soul through its fondness for activity but ignorance the product of darkness stupefies the senses in all embodied beings binding them by chains of folly indolence and lethargy purity brings happiness passion commotion and ignorance which obscures wisdom leads to a life of failure o prince purity prevails when passion and ignorance are overcome passion when purity and ignorance are overcome and ignorance when it overcomes purity and passion when the light of knowledge gleams forth from all the gates of the body then be sure that purity prevails o best of indians avarice the impulse to act and the beginning of action itself are all due to the dominance of passion darkness stagnation folly and infatuation are the result of the dominance of ignorance o joy of the kuru clan when purity prevails the soul on quitting the body passes on to the pure regions where live those who know the highest when passion prevails the soul is reborn among those who love activity when ignorance rules it enters the wombs of the ignorant they say the fruit of a meritorious action is spotless and full of purity the outcome of passion is misery and of ignorance darkness purity engenders wisdom passion avarice and ignorance folly infatuation and darkness when purity is in the ascendant the man evolves when passion he neither evolves nor degenerates when ignorance he is lost as soon as man understands that it is only the qualities which act and nothing else and perceives that which is beyond he attains my divine nature when the soul transcends the qualities which are the real cause of physical existence then freed from birth and death from old age and misery he quaffs the nectar of immortality arjuna asked my lord by what signs can he who has transcended the qualities be recognized how does he act how does he live beyond them lord shri krishna replied o prince he who shuns not the quality which is present and longs not for that which is absent he who maintains an attitude of indifference who is not disturbed by the qualities who realises that it is only they who act and remains calm who accepts pain and pleasure as it comes is centred in his self to whom a piece of clay or stone or gold are the same who neither likes nor dislikes who is steadfast indifferent alike to praise or censure who looks equally upon honour and dishonour loves friends and foes alike abandons all initiative such is he who transcends the qualities and he who serves me and only me with unfaltering devotion shall overcome the qualities and become one with the eternal for i am the home of the spirit the continual source of immortality of eternal righteousness and of infinite joy thus in the holy book the bhagavad gita one of the upanishads in the science of the supreme spirit in the art of self knowledge in the colloquy between the divine lord shri krishna and the prince arjuna stands the fourteenth chapter entitled the three qualities fifteen the lord god lord shri krishna continued this phenomenal creation which is both ephemeral and eternal is like a tree but having its seed above in the highest and its ramifications on this earth below the scriptures are its leaves and he who understands this knows its branches shoot upwards and downwards deriving their nourishment from the qualities its buds are the objects of sense and its roots which follow the law causing man s regeneration and degeneration pierce downwards into the soil in this world its true form is not known neither its origin nor its end and its strength is not understood until the tree with its roots striking deep into the earth is hewn down by the sharp axe of non attachment beyond lies the path from which when found there is no return this is the primal god from whence this ancient creation has sprung the wise attain eternity when freed from pride and delusion they have conquered their love for the things of sense when renouncing desire and fixing their gaze on the self they have ceased to be tossed to and fro by the opposing sensations like pleasure and pain neither sun moon nor fire shines there those who go thither never come back for o arjuna that is my celestial home it is only a very small part of my eternal self which is the life of the universe drawing round itself the six senses the mind the last which have their source in nature when the supreme lord enters a body or leaves it he gathers these senses together and travels on with them as the wind gathers perfume while passing through the flowers he is the perception of the ear the eye the touch the taste and the smell yea and of the mind also and the enjoyment the things which they perceive is also his the ignorant do not see that it is he who is present in life and who departs at death or even that it is he who enjoys pleasure through the qualities only the eye of wisdom sees the saints with great effort find him within themselves but not the unintelligent who in spite of every effort cannot control their minds remember that the light which proceeding from the sun illumines the whole world and the light which is in the moon and that which is in the fire also all are born of me i enter this world and animate all my creatures with my vitality and by my cool moonbeams i nourish the plants becoming the fire of life i pass into their bodies and uniting with the vital streams of prana and apana i digest the various kinds of food i am enthroned in the hearts of all memory wisdom and discrimination owe their origins to me i am he who is to be realised in the scriptures i inspire their wisdom and i know their truth there are two aspects in nature the perishable and the imperishable all life in this world belongs to the former the unchanging element belongs to the latter but higher than all am i the supreme god the absolute self the eternal lord who pervades the worlds and upholds them all beyond comparison of the eternal with the non eternal am i who am called by scriptures and sages the supreme personality the highest god he who with unclouded vision sees me as the lord god knows all there is to be known and always shall worship me with his whole heart thus o sinless one i have revealed to thee this most mystic knowledge he who understands gains wisdom and attains the consummation of life thus in the holy book the bhagavad gita one of the upanishads in the science of the supreme spirit in the art of self knowledge in the colloquy between the divine lord shri krishna and the prince arjuna stands the fifteenth chapter entitled the lord god sixteen divine and demonic civilization lord shri krishna continued fearlessness clean living unceasing concentration on wisdom readiness to give self control a spirit of sacrifice regular study of the scriptures austerities candour harmlessness truth absence of wrath renunciation contentment straightforwardness compassion towards all uncovetousness courtesy modesty constancy valour forgiveness fortitude purity freedom from hate and vanity these are his who possesses the godly qualities o arjuna hypocrisy pride insolence cruelty ignorance belong to him who is born of the godless qualities godly qualities lead to liberation godless to bondage do not be anxious prince thou hast the godly qualities all beings are of two classes godly and godless the godly i have described i will now describe the other the godless do not know how to act or how to renounce they have neither purity nor truth they do not understand the right principles of conduct they say the universe is an accident with no purpose and no god life is created by sexual union a product of lust and nothing else thinking thus these degraded souls these enemies of mankind whose intelligence is negligible and whose deeds are monstrous come into the world only to destroy giving themselves up to insatiable passions hypocritical self sufficient and arrogant cherishing false conception founded on delusion they work only to carry out their own unholy purposes poring anxiously over evil resolutions which only end in death seeking only the gratification of desire as the highest goal seeing nothing beyond caught in the toils of a hundred vain hopes the slaves of passion and wrath they accumulate hoards of unjust wealth only to pander to their sensual desire this i have gained today tomorrow i will gratify another desire this wealth is mine now the rest shall be mine ere long i have slain one enemy i will slay the others also i am worthy to enjoy i am the almighty i am perfect powerful and happy i am rich i am well bred who is there to compare with me i will sacrifice i will give i will pay and i will enjoy thus blinded by ignorance perplexed by discordant thoughts entangled in the snares of desire infatuated by passion they sink into the horrors of hell self conceited stubborn rich proud and insolent they make a display of their patronage disregarding the rules of decency puffed up by power and inordinate conceit swayed by lust and wrath these wicked people hate me who am within them as i am within all those who thus hate me who are cruel the dregs of mankind i condemn them to a continuous miserable and godless rebirth so reborn they spend life after life enveloped in delusion and they never reach me o prince but degenerate into still lower forms of life the gates of hell are three lust wrath and avarice they destroy the self avoid them these are the gates which lead to darkness if a man avoid them he will ensure his own welfare and in the end will attain his liberation but he who neglects the commands of the scriptures and follows the promptings of passion he does not attain perfection happiness or the final goal therefore whenever there is doubt whether thou shouldst do a thing or not let the scriptures guide thy conduct in the light of the scriptures shouldst thou labour the whole of thy life thus in the holy book the bhagavad gita one of the upanishads in the science of the supreme spirit in the art of self knowledge in the colloquy between the divine lord shri krishna and the prince arjuna stands the sixteenth chapter entitled divine and demonic civilization seventeen the threefold faith arjuna asked my lord those who do acts of sacrifice not according to the scriptures but nevertheless with implicit faith what is their condition is it one of purity of passion or of ignorance lord shri krishna replied man has an inherent faith in one or another of the qualities purity passion and ignorance now listen the faith of every man conforms to his nature by nature he is full of faith he is in fact what his faith makes him the pure worship the true god the passionate the powers of wealth and magic the ignorant the spirits of the dead and of the lower orders of nature those who practise austerities not commanded by scripture who are slaves to hypocrisy and egotism who are carried away by the fury of desire and passion they are ignorant they torment the organs of the body and they harass me also who lives within know that they are devoted to evil the food which men enjoy is also threefold like the ways of sacrifice austerity and almsgiving listen to the distinction the foods that prolong life and increase purity vigour health cheerfulness and happiness are those that are delicious soothing substantial and agreeable these are loved by the pure those in whom passion is dominant like foods that are bitter sour salty over hot pungent dry and burning these produce unhappiness repentance and disease the ignorant love food which is stale not nourishing putrid and corrupt the leavings of others and unclean sacrifice is pure when it is offered by one who does not covet the fruit thereof when it is done according to the commands of scripture and with implicit faith that the sacrifice is a duty sacrifice which is performed for the sake of its results or for self glorification that o best of aryans is the product of passion sacrifice that is contrary to scriptural command that is unaccompanied by prayers or gifts of food or money and is without faith that is the product of ignorance worship of god and the master respect for the preacher and the philosopher purity rectitude continence and harmlessness all this is physical austerity speech that hurts no one that is true is pleasant to listen to and beneficial and the constant study of the scriptures this is austerity in speech serenity kindness silence self control and purity this is austerity of mind these threefold austerities performed with faith and without thought of reward may truly be accounted pure austerity coupled with hypocrisy or performed for the sake of self glorification popularity or vanity comes from passion and its result is always doubtful and temporary austerity done under delusion and accompanied with sorcery or torture to oneself or another may be assumed to spring from ignorance the gift which is given without thought of recompense in the belief that it ought to be made in a fit place at an opportune time and to a deserving person such a gift is pure that which is given for the sake of the results it will produce or with the hope of recompense or grudgingly that may truly be said to be the outcome of passion and that which is given at an unsuitable place or time or to one who is unworthy or with disrespect or contempt such a gift is the result of ignorance om tat sat is the triple designation of the eternal spirit by which of old the vedic scriptures the ceremonials and the sacrifices were ordained therefore all acts of sacrifice gifts and austerities prescribed by the scriptures are always begun by those who understand the spirit with the word om those who desire deliverance begin their acts of sacrifice austerity or gift with the word tat meaning that without thought of reward sat means reality or the highest good and also o arjuna it is used to mean an action of exceptional merit conviction in sacrifice in austerity and in giving is also called sat so too an action done only for the lord s sake whatsoever is done without faith whether it be sacrifice austerity or gift or anything else as called asat meaning unreal for it is the negation of sat o arjuna such an act has no significance here or hereafter thus in the holy book the bhagavad gita one of the upanishads in the science of the supreme spirit in the art of self knowledge in the colloquy between the divine lord shri krishna and the prince arjuna stands the seventeenth chapter entitled the threefold faith eighteen the spirit of renunciation arjuna asked o mighty one i desire to know how relinquishment is distinguished from renunciation lord shri krishna replied the sages say that renunciation means forgoing an action which springs from desire and relinquishing means the surrender of its fruit some philosophers say that all action is evil and should be abandoned others that acts of sacrifice benevolence and austerity should not be given up o best of indians listen to my judgment as regards this problem it has a threefold aspect acts of sacrifice benevolence and austerity should not be given up but should be performed for they purify the aspiring soul but they should be done with detachment and without thought of recompense this is my final judgment it is not right to give up actions which are obligatory and if they are misunderstood it is the result of sheer ignorance to avoid an action through fear of physical suffering because it is likely to be painful is to act from passion and the benefit of renunciation will not follow he who performs an obligatory action because he believes it to be a duty which ought to be done without any personal desire to do the act or to receive any return such renunciation is pure the wise man who has attained purity whose doubts are solved who is filled with the spirit of self abnegation does not shrink from action because it brings pain nor does he desire it because it brings pleasure but since those still in the body cannot entirely avoid action in their case abandonment of the fruit of action is considered as complete renunciation for those who cannot renounce all desire the fruit of action hereafter is threefold good evil and partly good and partly evil but for him who has renounced there is none i will tell thee now o mighty man the five causes which according to the final decision of philosophy must concur before an action can be accomplished they are a body a personality physical organs their manifold activity and destiny whatever action a man performs whether by muscular effort or by speech or by thought and whether it be right or wrong these five are the essential causes but the fool who supposes because of his immature judgment that it is his own self alone that acts he perverts the truth and does not see rightly he who has no pride and whose intellect is unalloyed by attachment even though he kill these people yet he does not kill them and his act does not bind him knowledge the knower and the object of knowledge these are the three incentives to action and the act the actor and the instrument are the threefold constituents the knowledge the act and the doer differ according to the qualities listen to this too that knowledge which sees the one indestructible in all beings the one indivisible in all separate lives may be truly called pure knowledge the knowledge which thinks of the manifold existence in all beings as separate that comes from passion but that which clings blindly to one idea as if it were all without logic truth or insight that has its origin in darkness an obligatory action done by one who is disinterested who neither likes nor dislikes it and gives no thought to the consequences that follow such an action is pure but even though an action involve the most strenuous endeavour yet if the doer is seeking to gratify his desires and is filled with personal vanity it may be assumed to originate in passion an action undertaken through delusion and with no regard to the spiritual issues involved or the real capacity of the doer or to the injury which may follow such an act may be assumed to be the product of ignorance but when a man has no sentiment and no personal vanity when he possesses courage and confidence cares not whether he succeeds or fails then his action arises from purity in him who is impulsive greedy looking for reward violent impure torn between joy and sorrow it may be assumed that in him passion is predominant while he whose purpose is infirm who is low minded stubborn dishonest malicious indolent despondent procrastinating he may be assumed to be in darkness reason and conviction are threefold according to the quality which is dominant i will explain them fully and severally o arjuna that intellect which understands the creation and dissolution of life what actions should be done and what not which discriminates between fear and fearlessness bondage and deliverance that is pure the intellect which does not understand what is right and what is wrong and what should be done and what not is under the sway of passion and that which shrouded in ignorance thinks wrong right and sees everything perversely o arjuna that intellect is ruled by darkness the conviction and steady concentration by which the mind the vitality and the senses are controlled o arjuna they are the product of purity the conviction which always holds fast to rituals to self interest and wealth for the sake of what they may bring forth that comes from passion and that which clings perversely to false idealism fear grief despair and vanity is the product of ignorance hear further the three kinds of pleasure that which increases day after day delivers one from misery which at first seems like poison but afterwards acts like nectar that pleasure is pure for it is born of wisdom that which as first is like nectar because the senses revel in their objects but in the end acts like poison that pleasure arises from passion while the pleasure which from first to last merely drugs the senses which springs from indolence lethargy and folly that pleasure flows from ignorance there is nothing anywhere on earth or in the higher worlds which is free from the three qualities for they are born of nature o arjuna the duties of spiritual teachers the soldiers the traders and the servants have all been fixed according to the dominant quality in their nature serenity self restraint austerity purity forgiveness as well as uprightness knowledge wisdom and faith in god these constitute the duty of a spiritual teacher valour glory firmness skill generosity steadiness in battle and ability to rule these constitute the duty of a soldier they flow from his own nature agriculture protection of the cow and trade are the duty of a trader again in accordance with his nature the duty of a servant is to serve and that too agrees with his nature perfection is attained when each attends diligently to his duty listen and i will tell you how it is attained by him who always minds his own duty man reaches perfection by dedicating his actions to god who is the source of all being and fills everything it is better to do one s own duty however defective it may be than to follow the duty of another however well one may perform it he who does his duty as his own nature reveals it never sins the duty that of itself falls to one s lot should not be abandoned though it may have its defects all acts are marred by defects as fire is obscured by smoke he whose mind is entirely detached who has conquered himself whose desires have vanished by his renunciation reaches that stage of perfect freedom where action completes itself and leaves no seed i will now state briefly how he who has reached perfection finds the eternal spirit the state of supreme wisdom guided always by pure reason bravely restraining himself renouncing the objects of sense and giving up attachment and hatred enjoying solitude abstemiousness his body mind and speech under perfect control absorbed in meditation he becomes free always filled with the spirit of renunciation having abandoned selfishness power arrogance anger and desire possessing nothing of his own and having attained peace he is fit to join the eternal spirit and when he becomes one with the eternal and his soul knows the bliss that belongs to the self he feels no desire and no regret he regards all beings equally and enjoys the blessing of supreme devotion to me by such devotion he sees me who i am and what i am and thus realising the truth he enters my kingdom relying on me in all his action and doing them for my sake he attains by my grace eternal and unchangeable life surrender then thy actions unto me live in me concentrate thine intellect on me and think always of me fix but thy mind on me and by my grace thou shalt overcome the obstacles in thy path but if misled by pride thou wilt not listen then indeed thou shalt be lost if thou in thy vanity thinkest of avoiding this fight thy will shall not be fulfilled for nature herself will compel thee o arjuna thy duty binds thee from thine own nature has it arisen and that which in thy delusion thou desire not to do that very thing thou shalt do thou art helpless god dwells in the hearts of all beings o arjuna he causes them to revolve as it were on a wheel by his mystic power with all thy strength fly unto him and surrender thyself and by his grace shalt thou attain supreme peace and reach the eternal home thus have i revealed to thee the truth the mystery of mysteries having thought it over thou art free to act as thou wilt only listen once more to my last word the deepest secret of all thou art my beloved thou are my friend and i speak for thy welfare dedicate thyself to me worship me sacrifice all for me prostrate thyself before me and to me thou shalt surely come truly do i pledge thee thou art my own beloved give up then thy earthly duties surrender thyself to me only do not be anxious i will absolve thee from all thy sin speak not this to one who has not practised austerities or to him who does not love or who will not listen or who mocks but he who teaches this great secret to my devotees his is the highest devotion and verily he shall come unto me nor is there among men any who can perform a service dearer to me than this or any man on earth more beloved by me than he he who will study this spiritual discourse of ours i assure thee he shall thereby worship me at the altar of wisdom yea he who listens to it with faith and without doubt even he freed from evil shalt rise to the worlds which the virtuous attain through righteous deeds o arjuna hast thou listened attentively to my words has thy ignorance and thy delusion gone arjuna replied my lord o immutable one my delusion has fled by thy grace o changeless one the light has dawned my doubts are gone and i stand before thee ready to do thy will sanjaya told thus have i heard this rare wonderful and soul stirring discourse of the lord shri krishna and the great souled arjuna through the blessing of the sage vyasa i listened to this secret and noble science from the lips of its master the lord shri krishna o king the more i think of that marvellous and holy discourse the more i lose myself in joy as memory recalls again and again the exceeding beauty of the lord i am filled with amazement and happiness wherever is the lord shri krishna the prince of wisdom and wherever is arjuna the great archer i am more than convinced that good fortune victory happiness and righteousness will follow thus in the holy book the bhagavad gita one of the upanishads in the science of the supreme spirit in the art of self knowledge in the colloquy between the divine lord shri krishna and the prince arjuna stands the eighteenth chapter entitled the spirit of renunciation may the lord shri krishna bless you
