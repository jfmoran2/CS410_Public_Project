now these are the names of the sons of israel who came into egypt with jacob every man came with his household reuben simeon levi and judah issachar zebulun and benjamin dan and naphtali gad and asher and all the souls that came out of the loins of jacob were seventy souls and joseph was in egypt already and joseph died and all his brethren and all that generation and the children of israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceeding mighty and the land was filled with them now there arose a new king over egypt who knew not joseph and he said unto his people behold the people of the children of israel are too many and too mighty for us come let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when there befalleth us any war they also join themselves unto our enemies and fight against us and get them up out of the land therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens and they built for pharaoh store cities pithom and raamses but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad and they were adread because of the children of israel and the egyptians made the children of israel to serve with rigour and they made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and in brick and in all manner of service in the field in all their service wherein they made them serve with rigour and the king of egypt spoke to the hebrew midwives of whom the name of the one was shiphrah and the name of the other puah and he said when ye do the office of a midwife to the hebrew women ye shall look upon the birthstool if it be a son then ye shall kill him but if it be a daughter then she shall live but the midwives feared god and did not as the king of egypt commanded them but saved the men children alive and the king of egypt called for the midwives and said unto them why have ye done this thing and have saved the men children alive and the midwives said unto pharaoh because the hebrew women are not as the egyptian women for they are lively and are delivered ere the midwife come unto them and god dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty and it came to pass because the midwives feared god that he made them houses and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son that is born ye shall cast into the river and every daughter ye shall save alive and there went a man of the house of levi and took to wife a daughter of levi and the woman conceived and bore a son and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hid him three months and when she could not longer hide him she took for him an ark of bulrushes and daubed it with slime and with pitch and she put the child therein and laid it in the flags by the river s brink and his sister stood afar off to know what would be done to him and the daughter of pharaoh came down to bathe in the river and her maidens walked along by the river side and she saw the ark among the flags and sent her handmaid to fetch it and she opened it and saw it even the child and behold a boy that wept and she had compassion on him and said this is one of the hebrews children then said his sister to pharaoh s daughter shall i go and call thee a nurse of the hebrew women that she may nurse the child for thee and pharaoh s daughter said to her go and the maiden went and called the child s mother and pharaoh s daughter said unto her take this child away and nurse it for me and i will give thee thy wages and the woman took the child and nursed it and the child grew and she brought him unto pharaoh s daughter and he became her son and she called his name moses and said because i drew him out of the water and it came to pass in those days when moses was grown up that he went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens and he saw an egyptian smiting a hebrew one of his brethren and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there was no man he smote the egyptian and hid him in the sand and he went out the second day and behold two men of the hebrews were striving together and he said to him that did the wrong wherefore smitest thou thy fellow and he said who made thee a ruler and a judge over us thinkest thou to kill me as thou didst kill the egyptian and moses feared and said surely the thing is known now when pharaoh heard this thing he sought to slay moses but moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of midian and he sat down by a well now the priest of midian had seven daughters and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father s flock and the shepherds came and drove them away but moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock and when they came to reuel their father he said how is it that ye are come so soon to day and they said an egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and moreover he drew water for us and watered the flock and he said unto his daughters and where is he why is it that ye have left the man call him that he may eat bread and moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave moses zipporah his daughter and she bore a son and he called his name gershom for he said i have been a stranger in a strange land and it came to pass in the course of those many days that the king of egypt died and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto god by reason of the bondage and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and with jacob and god saw the children of israel and god took cognizance of them s now moses was keeping the flock of jethro his father in law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the farthest end of the wilderness and came to the mountain of god unto horeb and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will turn aside now and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people that are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for i know their pains and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the canaanite and the hittite and the amorite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite and now behold the cry of the children of israel is come unto me moreover i have seen the oppression wherewith the egyptians oppress them come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt and moses said unto god who am i that i should go unto pharaoh and that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be the token unto thee that i have sent thee when thou hast brought forth the people out of egypt ye shall serve god upon this mountain and moses said unto god behold when i come unto the children of israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say unto them and god said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me unto you and god said moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel the lord the god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name for ever and this is my memorial unto all generations go and gather the elders of israel together and say unto them the lord the god of your fathers the god of abraham of isaac and of jacob hath appeared unto me saying i have surely remembered you and seen that which is done to you in egypt and i have said i will bring you up out of the affliction of egypt unto the land of the canaanite and the hittite and the amorite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite unto a land flowing with milk and honey and they shall hearken to thy voice and thou shalt come thou and the elders of israel unto the king of egypt and ye shall say unto him the lord the god of the hebrews hath met with us and now let us go we pray thee three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the lord our god and i know that the king of egypt will not give you leave to go except by a mighty hand and i will put forth my hand and smite egypt with all my wonders which i will do in the midst thereof and after that he will let you go and i will give this people favour in the sight of the egyptians and it shall come to pass that when ye go ye shall not go empty but every woman shall ask of her neighbour and of her that sojourneth in her house jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters and ye shall spoil the egyptians and moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the lord hath not appeared unto thee and the lord said unto him what is that in thy hand and he said a rod and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and moses fled from before it and the lord said unto moses put forth thy hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and laid hold of it and it became a rod in his hand that they may believe that the lord the god of their fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath appeared unto thee and the lord said furthermore unto him put now thy hand into thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was leprous as white as snow and he said put thy hand back into thy bosom and he put his hand back into his bosom and when he took it out of his bosom behold it was turned again as his other flesh and it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign and it shall come to pass if they will not believe even these two signs neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land and moses said unto the lord oh lord i am not a man of words neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant for i am slow of speech and of a slow tongue and the lord said unto him who hath made man s mouth or who maketh a man dumb or deaf or seeing or blind is it not i the lord now therefore go and i will be with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt speak and he said oh lord send i pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt send and the anger of the lord was kindled against moses and he said is there not aaron thy brother the levite i know that he can speak well and also behold he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart and thou shalt speak unto him and put the words in his mouth and i will be with thy mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what ye shall do and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and it shall come to pass that he shall be to thee a mouth and thou shalt be to him in god s stead and thou shalt take in thy hand this rod wherewith thou shalt do the signs and moses went and returned to jethro his father in law and said unto him let me go i pray thee and return unto my brethren that are in egypt and see whether they be yet alive and jethro said to moses go in peace and the lord said unto moses in midian go return into egypt for all the men are dead that sought thy life and moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and he returned to the land of egypt and moses took the rod of god in his hand and the lord said unto moses when thou goest back into egypt see that thou do before pharaoh all the wonders which i have put in thy hand but i will harden his heart and he will not let the people go and thou shalt say unto pharaoh thus saith the lord israel is my son my first born and i have said unto thee let my son go that he may serve me and thou hast refused to let him go behold i will slay thy son thy first born and it came to pass on the way at the lodging place that the lord met him and sought to kill him then zipporah took a flint and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at his feet and she said surely a bridegroom of blood art thou to me so he let him alone then she said a bridegroom of blood in regard of the circumcision and the lord said to aaron go into the wilderness to meet moses and he went and met him in the mountain of god and kissed him and moses told aaron all the words of the lord wherewith he had sent him and all the signs wherewith he had charged him and moses and aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of israel and aaron spoke all the words which the lord had spoken unto moses and did the signs in the sight of the people and the people believed and when they heard that the lord had remembered the children of israel and that he had seen their affliction then they bowed their heads and worshipped and afterward moses and aaron came and said unto pharaoh thus saith the lord the god of israel let my people go that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness and pharaoh said who is the lord that i should hearken unto his voice to let israel go i know not the lord and moreover i will not let israel go and they said the god of the hebrews hath met with us let us go we pray thee three days journey into the wilderness and sacrifice unto the lord our god lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword and the king of egypt said unto them wherefore do ye moses and aaron cause the people to break loose from their work get you unto your burdens and pharaoh said behold the people of the land are now many and will ye make them rest from their burdens and the same day pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers saying ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick as heretofore let them go and gather straw for themselves and the tale of the bricks which they did make heretofore ye shall lay upon them ye shall not diminish aught thereof for they are idle therefore they cry saying let us go and sacrifice to our god let heavier work be laid upon the men that they may labour therein and let them not regard lying words and the taskmasters of the people went out and their officers and they spoke to the people saying thus saith pharaoh i will not give you straw go yourselves get you straw where ye can find it for nought of your work shall be diminished so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of egypt to gather stubble for straw and the taskmasters were urgent saying fulfil your work your daily task as when there was straw and the officers of the children of israel whom pharaoh s taskmasters had set over them were beaten saying wherefore have ye not fulfilled your appointed task in making brick both yesterday and today as heretofore then the officers of the children of israel came and cried unto pharaoh saying wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants there is no straw given unto thy servants and they say to us make brick and behold thy servants are beaten but the fault is in thine own people but he said ye are idle ye are idle therefore ye say let us go and sacrifice to the lord go therefore now and work for there shall no straw be given you yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks and the officers of the children of israel did see that they were set on mischief when they said ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks your daily task and they met moses and aaron who stood in the way as they came forth from pharaoh and they said unto them the lord look upon you and judge because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword in their hand to slay us and moses returned unto the lord and said lord wherefore hast thou dealt ill with this people why is it that thou hast sent me for since i came to pharaoh to speak in thy name he hath dealt ill with this people neither hast thou delivered thy people at all and the lord said unto moses now shalt thou see what i will do to pharaoh for by a strong hand shall he let them go and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land s and god spoke unto moses and said unto him i am the lord and i appeared unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob as god almighty but by my name yhwh i made me not known to them and i have also established my covenant with them to give them the land of canaan the land of their sojournings wherein they sojourned and moreover i have heard the groaning of the children of israel whom the egyptians keep in bondage and i have remembered my covenant wherefore say unto the children of israel i am the lord and i will bring you out from under the burdens of the egyptians and i will deliver you from their bondage and i will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments and i will take you to me for a people and i will be to you a god and ye shall know that i am the lord your god who brought you out from under the burdens of the egyptians and i will bring you in unto the land concerning which i lifted up my hand to give it to abraham to isaac and to jacob and i will give it you for a heritage i am the lord and moses spoke so unto the children of israel but they hearkened not unto moses for impatience of spirit and for cruel bondage and the lord spoke unto moses saying go in speak unto pharaoh king of egypt that he let the children of israel go out of his land and moses spoke before the lord saying behold the children of israel have not hearkened unto me how then shall pharaoh hear me who am of uncircumcised lips and the lord spoke unto moses and unto aaron and gave them a charge unto the children of israel and unto pharaoh king of egypt to bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt s these are the heads of their fathers houses the sons of reuben the first born of israel hanoch and pallu hezron and carmi these are the families of reuben and the sons of simeon jemuel and jamin and ohad and jachin and zohar and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman these are the families of simeon and these are the names of the sons of levi according to their generations gershon and kohath and merari and the years of the life of levi were a hundred thirty and seven years the sons of gershon libni and shimei according to their families and the sons of kohath amram and izhar and hebron and uzziel and the years of the life of kohath were a hundred thirty and three years and the sons of merari mahli and mushi these are the families of the levites according to their generations and amram took him jochebed his father s sister to wife and she bore him aaron and moses and the years of the life of amram were a hundred and thirty and seven years and the sons of izhar korah and nepheg and zichri and the sons of uzziel mishael and elzaphan and sithri and aaron took him elisheba the daughter of amminadab the sister of nahshon to wife and she bore him nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar and the sons of korah assir and elkanah and abiasaph these are the families of the korahites and eleazar aaron s son took him one of the daughters of putiel to wife and she bore him phinehas these are the heads of the fathers houses of the levites according to their families these are that aaron and moses to whom the lord said bring out the children of israel from the land of egypt according to their hosts these are they that spoke to pharaoh king of egypt to bring out the children of israel from egypt these are that moses and aaron and it came to pass on the day when the lord spoke unto moses in the land of egypt s that the lord spoke unto moses saying i am the lord speak thou unto pharaoh king of egypt all that i speak unto thee and moses said before the lord behold i am of uncircumcised lips and how shall pharaoh hearken unto me and the lord said unto moses see i have set thee in god s stead to pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet thou shalt speak all that i command thee and aaron thy brother shall speak unto pharaoh that he let the children of israel go out of his land and i will harden pharaoh s heart and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of egypt but pharaoh will not hearken unto you and i will lay my hand upon egypt and bring forth my hosts my people the children of israel out of the land of egypt by great judgments and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i stretch forth my hand upon egypt and bring out the children of israel from among them and moses and aaron did so as the lord commanded them so did they and moses was fourscore years old and aaron fourscore and three years old when they spoke unto pharaoh and the lord spoke unto moses and unto aaron saying when pharaoh shall speak unto you saying show a wonder for you then thou shalt say unto aaron take thy rod and cast it down before pharaoh that it become a serpent and moses and aaron went in unto pharaoh and they did so as the lord had commanded and aaron cast down his rod before pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent then pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers and they also the magicians of egypt did in like manner with their secret arts for they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents but aaron s rod swallowed up their rods and pharaoh s heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them as the lord had spoken s and the lord said unto moses pharaoh s heart is stubborn he refuseth to let the people go get thee unto pharaoh in the morning lo he goeth out unto the water and thou shalt stand by the river s brink to meet him and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand and thou shalt say unto him the lord the god of the hebrews hath sent me unto thee saying let my people go that they may serve me in the wilderness and behold hitherto thou hast not hearkened thus saith the lord in this thou shalt know that i am the lord behold i will smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river and they shall be turned to blood and the fish that are in the river shall die and the river shall become foul and the egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river s and the lord said unto moses say unto aaron take thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the waters of egypt over their rivers over their streams and over their pools and over all their ponds of water that they may become blood and there shall be blood throughout all the land of egypt both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone and moses and aaron did so as the lord commanded and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river in the sight of pharaoh and in the sight of his servants and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood and the fish that were in the river died and the river became foul and the egyptians could not drink water from the river and the blood was throughout all the land of egypt and the magicians of egypt did in like manner with their secret arts and pharaoh s heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them as the lord had spoken and pharaoh turned and went into his house neither did he lay even this to heart and all the egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink for they could not drink of the water of the river and seven days were fulfilled after that the lord had smitten the river and the lord spoke unto moses go in unto pharaoh and say unto him thus saith the lord let my people go that they may serve me and if thou refuse to let them go behold i will smite all thy borders with frogs and the river shall swarm with frogs which shall go up and come into thy house and into thy bed chamber and upon thy bed and into the house of thy servants and upon thy people and into thine ovens and into thy kneading troughs and the frogs shall come up both upon thee and upon thy people and upon all thy servants and the lord said unto moses say unto aaron stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers over the canals and over the pools and cause frogs to come up upon the land of egypt and aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt and the frogs came up and covered the land of egypt and the magicians did in like manner with their secret arts and brought up frogs upon the land of egypt then pharaoh called for moses and aaron and said entreat the lord that he take away the frogs from me and from my people and i will let the people go that they may sacrifice unto the lord and moses said unto pharaoh have thou this glory over me against what time shall i entreat for thee and for thy servants and for thy people that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses and remain in the river only and he said against to morrow and he said be it according to thy word that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the lord our god and the frogs shall depart from thee and from thy houses and from thy servants and from thy people they shall remain in the river only and moses and aaron went out from pharaoh and moses cried unto the lord concerning the frogs which he had brought upon pharaoh and the lord did according to the word of moses and the frogs died out of the houses out of the courts and out of the fields and they gathered them together in heaps and the land stank but when pharaoh saw that there was respite he hardened his heart and hearkened not unto them as the lord had spoken s and the lord said unto moses say unto aaron stretch out thy rod and smite the dust of the earth that it may become gnats throughout all the land of egypt and they did so and aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and smote the dust of the earth and there were gnats upon man and upon beast all the dust of the earth became gnats throughout all the land of egypt and the magicians did so with their secret arts to bring forth gnats but they could not and there were gnats upon man and upon beast then the magicians said unto pharaoh this is the finger of god and pharaoh s heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them as the lord had spoken s and the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning and stand before pharaoh lo he cometh forth to the water and say unto him thus saith the lord let my people go that they may serve me else if thou wilt not let my people go behold i will send swarms of flies upon thee and upon thy servants and upon thy people and into thy houses and the houses of the egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies and also the ground whereon they are and i will set apart in that day the land of goshen in which my people dwell that no swarms of flies shall be there to the end that thou mayest know that i am the lord in the midst of the earth and i will put a division between my people and thy people by to morrow shall this sign be and the lord did so and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of pharaoh and into his servants houses and in all the land of egypt the land was ruined by reason of the swarms of flies and pharaoh called for moses and for aaron and said go ye sacrifice to your god in the land and moses said it is not meet so to do for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians to the lord our god lo if we sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians before their eyes will they not stone us we will go three days journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the lord our god as he shall command us and pharaoh said i will let you go that ye may sacrifice to the lord your god in the wilderness only ye shall not go very far away entreat for me and moses said behold i go out from thee and i will entreat the lord that the swarms of flies may depart from pharaoh from his servants and from his people tomorrow only let not pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the lord and moses went out from pharaoh and entreated the lord and the lord did according to the word of moses and he removed the swarms of flies from pharaoh from his servants and from his people there remained not one and pharaoh hardened his heart this time also and he did not let the people go then the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh and tell him thus saith the lord the god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me for if thou refuse to let them go and wilt hold them still behold the hand of the lord is upon thy cattle which are in the field upon the horses upon the asses upon the camels upon the herds and upon the flocks there shall be a very grievous murrain and the lord shall make a division between the cattle of israel and the cattle of egypt and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the children of israel and the lord appointed a set time saying tomorrow the lord shall do this thing in the land and the lord did that thing on the morrow and all the cattle of egypt died but of the cattle of the children of israel died not one and pharaoh sent and behold there was not so much as one of the cattle of the israelites dead but the heart of pharaoh was stubborn and he did not let the people go and the lord said unto moses and unto aaron take to you handfuls of soot of the furnace and let moses throw it heavenward in the sight of pharaoh and it shall become small dust over all the land of egypt and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast throughout all the land of egypt and they took soot of the furnace and stood before pharaoh and moses threw it up heavenward and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast and the magicians could not stand before moses because of the boils for the boils were upon the magicians and upon all the egyptians and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh and he hearkened not unto them as the lord had spoken unto moses s and the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning and stand before pharaoh and say unto him thus saith the lord the god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me for i will this time send all my plagues upon thy person and upon thy servants and upon thy people that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth surely now i had put forth my hand and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence and thou hadst been cut off from the earth but in very deed for this cause have i made thee to stand to show thee my power and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people that thou wilt not let them go behold tomorrow about this time i will cause it to rain a very grievous hail such as hath not been in egypt since the day it was founded even until now now therefore send hasten in thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field for every man and beast that shall be found in the field and shall not be brought home the hail shall come down upon them and they shall die he that feared the word of the lord among the servants of pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses and he that regarded not the word of the lord left his servants and his cattle in the field and the lord said unto moses stretch forth thy hand toward heaven that there may be hail in all the land of egypt upon man and upon beast and upon every herb of the field throughout the land of egypt and moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven and the lord sent thunder and hail and fire ran down unto the earth and the lord caused to hail upon the land of egypt so there was hail and fire flashing up amidst the hail very grievous such as had not been in all the land of egypt since it became a nation and the hail smote throughout all the land of egypt all that was in the field both man and beast and the hail smote every herb of the field and broke every tree of the field only in the land of goshen where the children of israel were was there no hail and pharaoh sent and called for moses and aaron and said unto them i have sinned this time the lord is righteous and i and my people are wicked entreat the lord and let there be enough of these mighty thunderings and hail and i will let you go and ye shall stay no longer and moses said unto him as soon as i am gone out of the city i will spread forth my hands unto the lord the thunders shall cease neither shall there be any more hail that thou mayest know that the earth is the lord s but as for thee and thy servants i know that ye will not yet fear the lord god and the flax and the barley were smitten for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bloom but the wheat and the spelt were not smitten for they ripen late and moses went out of the city from pharaoh and spread forth his hands unto the lord and the thunders and hail ceased and the rain was not poured upon the earth and when pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased he sinned yet more and hardened his heart he and his servants and the heart of pharaoh was hardened and he did not let the children of israel go as the lord had spoken by moses and the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh for i have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants that i might show these my signs in the midst of them and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son and of thy son s son what i have wrought upon egypt and my signs which i have done among them that ye may know that i am the lord and moses and aaron went in unto pharaoh and said unto him thus saith the lord the god of the hebrews how long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me let my people go that they may serve me else if thou refuse to let my people go behold to morrow will i bring locusts into thy border and they shall cover the face of the earth that one shall not be able to see the earth and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped which remaineth unto you from the hail and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field and thy houses shall be filled and the houses of all thy servants and the houses of all the egyptians as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers fathers have seen since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day and he turned and went out from pharaoh and pharaoh s servants said unto him how long shall this man be a snare unto us let the men go that they may serve the lord their god knowest thou not yet that egypt is destroyed and moses and aaron were brought again unto pharaoh and he said unto them go serve the lord your god but who are they that shall go and moses said we will go with our young and with our old with our sons and with our daughters with our flocks and with our herds we will go for we must hold a feast unto the lord and he said unto them so be the lord with you as i will let you go and your little ones see ye that evil is before your face not so go now ye that are men and serve the lord for that is what ye desire and they were driven out from pharaoh s presence s and the lord said unto moses stretch out thy hand over the land of egypt for the locusts that they may come up upon the land of egypt and eat every herb of the land even all that the hail hath left and moses stretched forth his rod over the land of egypt and the lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all the night and when it was morning the east wind brought the locusts and the locusts went up over all the land of egypt and rested in all the borders of egypt very grievous were they before them there were no such locusts as they neither after them shall be such for they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land was darkened and they did eat every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left and there remained not any green thing either tree or herb of the field through all the land of egypt then pharaoh called for moses and aaron in haste and he said i have sinned against the lord your god and against you now therefore forgive i pray thee my sin only this once and entreat the lord your god that he may take away from me this death only and he went out from pharaoh and entreated the lord and the lord turned an exceeding strong west wind which took up the locusts and drove them into the red sea there remained not one locust in all the border of egypt but the lord hardened pharaoh s heart and he did not let the children of israel go and the lord said unto moses stretch out thy hand toward heaven that there may be darkness over the land of egypt even darkness which may be felt and moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven and there was a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three days they saw not one another neither rose any from his place for three days but all the children of israel had light in their dwellings and pharaoh called unto moses and said go ye serve the lord only let your flocks and your herds be stayed let your little ones also go with you and moses said thou must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings that we may sacrifice unto the lord our god our cattle also shall go with us there shall not a hoof be left behind for thereof must we take to serve the lord our god and we know not with what we must serve the lord until we come thither but the lord hardened pharaoh s heart and he would not let them go and pharaoh said unto him get thee from me take heed to thyself see my face no more for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die and moses said thou hast spoken well i will see thy face again no more and the lord said unto moses yet one plague more will i bring upon pharaoh and upon egypt afterwards he will let you go hence when he shall let you go he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether speak now in the ears of the people and let them ask every man of his neighbour and every woman of her neighbour jewels of silver and jewels of gold and the lord gave the people favour in the sight of the egyptians moreover the man moses was very great in the land of egypt in the sight of pharaoh s servants and in the sight of the people s and moses said thus saith the lord about midnight will i go out into the midst of egypt and all the first born in the land of egypt shall die from the first born of pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne even unto the first born of the maid servant that is behind the mill and all the first born of cattle and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of egypt such as there hath been none like it nor shall be like it any more but against any of the children of israel shall not a dog whet his tongue against man or beast that ye may know how that the lord doth put a difference between the egyptians and israel and all these thy servants shall come down unto me and bow down unto me saying get thee out and all the people that follow thee and after that i will go out and he went out from pharaoh in hot anger s and the lord said unto moses pharaoh will not hearken unto you that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of egypt and moses and aaron did all these wonders before pharaoh and the lord hardened pharaoh s heart and he did not let the children of israel go out of his land s and the lord spoke unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speak ye unto all the congregation of israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to their fathers houses a lamb for a household and if the household be too little for a lamb then shall he and his neighbour next unto his house take one according to the number of the souls according to every man s eating ye shall make your count for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye shall take it from the sheep or from the goats and ye shall keep it unto the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it at dusk and they shall take of the blood and put it on the two side posts and on the lintel upon the houses wherein they shall eat it and they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast with fire its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning but that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire and thus shall ye eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it is the lord s passover for i will go through the land of egypt in that night and will smite all the first born in the land of egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgments i am the lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and ye shall keep it a feast to the lord throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread howbeit the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day that soul shall be cut off from israel and in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation and in the seventh day a holy convocation no manner of work shall be done in them save that which every man must eat that only may be done by you and ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread for in this selfsame day have i brought your hosts out of the land of egypt therefore shall ye observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance for ever in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at even ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the month at even seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses for whosoever eateth that which is leavened that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of israel whether he be a sojourner or one that is born in the land ye shall eat nothing leavened in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread then moses called for all the elders of israel and said unto them draw out and take you lambs according to your families and kill the passover lamb and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning for the lord will pass through to smite the egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel and on the two side posts the lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you and ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever and it shall come to pass when ye be come to the land which the lord will give you according as he hath promised that ye shall keep this service and it shall come to pass when your children shall say unto you what mean ye by this service that ye shall say it is the sacrifice of the lord s passover for that he passed over the houses of the children of israel in egypt when he smote the egyptians and delivered our houses and the people bowed the head and worshipped and the children of israel went and did so as the lord had commanded moses and aaron so did they s and it came to pass at midnight that the lord smote all the firstborn in the land of egypt from the first born of pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the first born of the captive that was in the dungeon and all the first born of cattle and pharaoh rose up in the night he and all his servants and all the egyptians and there was a great cry in egypt for there was not a house where there was not one dead and he called for moses and aaron by night and said rise up get you forth from among my people both ye and the children of israel and go serve the lord as ye have said take both your flocks and your herds as ye have said and be gone and bless me also and the egyptians were urgent upon the people to send them out of the land in haste for they said we are all dead men and the people took their dough before it was leavened their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders and the children of israel did according to the word of moses and they asked of the egyptians jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and the lord gave the people favour in the sight of the egyptians so that they let them have what they asked and they despoiled the egyptians and the children of israel journeyed from rameses to succoth about six hundred thousand men on foot beside children and a mixed multitude went up also with them and flocks and herds even very much cattle and they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of egypt for it was not leavened because they were thrust out of egypt and could not tarry neither had they prepared for themselves any victual now the time that the children of israel dwelt in egypt was four hundred and thirty years and it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years even the selfsame day it came to pass that all the host of the lord went out from the land of egypt it was a night of watching unto the lord for bringing them out from the land of egypt this same night is a night of watching unto the lord for all the children of israel throughout their generations and the lord said unto moses and aaron this is the ordinance of the passover there shall no alien eat thereof but every man s servant that is bought for money when thou hast circumcised him then shall he eat thereof a sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof in one house shall it be eaten thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house neither shall ye break a bone thereof all the congregation of israel shall keep it and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the passover to the lord let all his males be circumcised and then let him come near and keep it and he shall be as one that is born in the land but no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof one law shall be to him that is homeborn and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you thus did all the children of israel as the lord commanded moses and aaron so did they s and it came to pass the selfsame day that the lord did bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt by their hosts and the lord spoke unto moses saying sanctify unto me all the first born whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of israel both of man and of beast it is mine and moses said unto the people remember this day in which ye came out from egypt out of the house of bondage for by strength of hand the lord brought you out from this place there shall no leavened bread be eaten this day ye go forth in the month abib and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanite and the hittite and the amorite and the hivite and the jebusite which he swore unto thy fathers to give thee a land flowing with milk and honey that thou shalt keep this service in this month seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the lord unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy borders and thou shalt tell thy son in that day saying it is because of that which the lord did for me when i came forth out of egypt and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand and for a memorial between thine eyes that the law of the lord may be in thy mouth for with a strong hand hath the lord brought thee out of egypt thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanite as he swore unto thee and to thy fathers and shall give it thee that thou shalt set apart unto the lord all that openeth the womb every firstling that is a male which thou hast coming of a beast shall be the lord s and every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou wilt not redeem it then thou shalt break its neck and all the first born of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying what is this that thou shalt say unto him by strength of hand the lord brought us out from egypt from the house of bondage and it came to pass when pharaoh would hardly let us go that the lord slew all the firstborn in the land of egypt both the first born of man and the first born of beast therefore i sacrifice to the lord all that openeth the womb being males but all the first born of my sons i redeem and it shall be for a sign upon thy hand and for frontlets between thine eyes for by strength of hand the lord brought us forth out of egypt s and it came to pass when pharaoh had let the people go that god led them not by the way of the land of the philistines although that was near for god said lest peradventure the people repent when they see war and they return to egypt but god led the people about by the way of the wilderness by the red sea and the children of israel went up armed out of the land of egypt and moses took the bones of joseph with him for he had straitly sworn the children of israel saying god will surely remember you and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you and they took their journey from succoth and encamped in etham in the edge of the wilderness and the lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light that they might go by day and by night the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night departed not from before the people and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel that they turn back and encamp before pi hahiroth between migdol and the sea before baal zephon over against it shall ye encamp by the sea and pharaoh will say of the children of israel they are entangled in the land the wilderness hath shut them in and i will harden pharaoh s heart and he shall follow after them and i will get me honour upon pharaoh and upon all his host and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord and they did so and it was told the king of egypt that the people were fled and the heart of pharaoh and of his servants was turned towards the people and they said what is this we have done that we have let israel go from serving us and he made ready his chariots and took his people with him and he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the chariots of egypt and captains over all of them and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of egypt and he pursued after the children of israel for the children of israel went out with a high hand and the egyptians pursued after them all the horses and chariots of pharaoh and his horsemen and his army and overtook them encamping by the sea beside pi hahiroth in front of baal zephon and when pharaoh drew nigh the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians were marching after them and they were sore afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the lord and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to bring us forth out of egypt is not this the word that we spoke unto thee in egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it were better for us to serve the egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will work for you to day for whereas ye have seen the egyptians to day ye shall see them again no more for ever the lord will fight for you and ye shall hold your peace and the lord said unto moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak unto the children of israel that they go forward and lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground and i behold i will harden the hearts of the egyptians and they shall go in after them and i will get me honour upon pharaoh and upon all his host upon his chariots and upon his horsemen and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i have gotten me honour upon pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his horsemen and the angel of god who went before the camp of israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of cloud removed from before them and stood behind them and it came between the camp of egypt and the camp of israel and there was the cloud and the darkness here yet gave it light by night there and the one came not near the other all the night and moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left and the egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea all pharaoh s horses his chariots and his horsemen and it came to pass in the morning watch that the lord looked forth upon the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud and discomfited the host of the egyptians and he took off their chariot wheels and made them to drive heavily so that the egyptians said let us flee from the face of israel for the lord fighteth for them against the egyptians and the lord said unto moses stretch out thy hand over the sea that the waters may come back upon the egyptians upon their chariots and upon their horsemen and moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared and the egyptians fled against it and the lord overthrew the egyptians in the midst of the sea and the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen even all the host of pharaoh that went in after them into the sea there remained not so much as one of them but the children of israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left thus the lord saved israel that day out of the hand of the egyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the sea shore and israel saw the great work which the lord did upon the egyptians and the people feared the lord and they believed in the lord and in his servant moses then sang moses and the children of israel this song unto the lord and spoke saying i will sing unto the lord for he is highly exalted the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea the lord is my strength and song and he is become my salvation this is my god and i will glorify him my father s god and i will exalt him the lord is a man of war the lord is his name pharaoh s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea and his chosen captains are sunk in the red sea the deeps cover them they went down into the depths like a stone thy right hand o lord glorious in power thy right hand o lord dasheth in pieces the enemy and in the greatness of thine excellency thou overthrowest them that rise up against thee thou sendest forth thy wrath it consumeth them as stubble and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were piled up the floods stood upright as a heap the deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea the enemy said i will pursue i will overtake i will divide the spoil my lust shall be satisfied upon them i will draw my sword my hand shall destroy them thou didst blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sank as lead in the mighty waters who is like unto thee o lord among the mighty who is like unto thee glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders thou stretchedst out thy right hand the earth swallowed them thou in thy love hast led the people that thou hast redeemed thou hast guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation the peoples have heard they tremble pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of philistia then were the chiefs of edom affrighted the mighty men of moab trembling taketh hold upon them all the inhabitants of canaan are melted away terror and dread falleth upon them by the greatness of thine arm they are as still as a stone till thy people pass over o lord till the people pass over that thou hast gotten thou bringest them in and plantest them in the mountain of thine inheritance the place o lord which thou hast made for thee to dwell in the sanctuary o lord which thy hands have established the lord shall reign for ever and ever for the horses of pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea and the lord brought back the waters of the sea upon them but the children of israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea and miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances and miriam sang unto them sing ye to the lord for he is highly exalted the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea s and moses led israel onward from the red sea and they went out into the wilderness of shur and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water and when they came to marah they could not drink of the waters of marah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called marah and the people murmured against moses saying what shall we drink and he cried unto the lord and the lord showed him a tree and he cast it into the waters and the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he proved them and he said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the lord thy god and wilt do that which is right in his eyes and wilt give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes i will put none of the diseases upon thee which i have put upon the egyptians for i am the lord that healeth thee s and they came to elim where were twelve springs of water and three score and ten palm trees and they encamped there by the waters and they took their journey from elim and all the congregation of the children of israel came unto the wilderness of sin which is between elim and sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of egypt and the whole congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron in the wilderness and the children of israel said unto them would that we had died by the hand of the lord in the land of egypt when we sat by the flesh pots when we did eat bread to the full for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger s then said the lord unto moses behold i will cause to rain bread from heaven for you and the people shall go out and gather a day s portion every day that i may prove them whether they will walk in my law or not and it shall come to pass on the sixth day that they shall prepare that which they bring in and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily and moses and aaron said unto all the children of israel at even then ye shall know that the lord hath brought you out from the land of egypt and in the morning then ye shall see the glory of the lord for that he hath heard your murmurings against the lord and what are we that ye murmur against us and moses said this shall be when the lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat and in the morning bread to the full for that the lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him and what are we your murmurings are not against us but against the lord and moses said unto aaron say unto all the congregation of the children of israel come near before the lord for he hath heard your murmurings and it came to pass as aaron spoke unto the whole congregation of the children of israel that they looked toward the wilderness and behold the glory of the lord appeared in the cloud and the lord spoke unto moses saying i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel speak unto them saying at dusk ye shall eat flesh and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread and ye shall know that i am the lord your god and it came to pass at even that the quails came up and covered the camp and in the morning there was a layer of dew round about the camp and when the layer of dew was gone up behold upon the face of the wilderness a fine scale like thing fine as the hoar frost on the ground and when the children of israel saw it they said one to another what is it for they knew not what it was and moses said unto them it is the bread which the lord hath given you to eat this is the thing which the lord hath commanded gather ye of it every man according to his eating an omer a head according to the number of your persons shall ye take it every man for them that are in his tent and the children of israel did so and gathered some more some less and when they did mete it with an omer he that gathered much had nothing over and he that gathered little had no lack they gathered every man according to his eating and moses said unto them let no man leave of it till the morning notwithstanding they hearkened not unto moses but some of them left of it until the morning and it bred worms and rotted and moses was wroth with them and they gathered it morning by morning every man according to his eating and as the sun waxed hot it melted and it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread two omers for each one and all the rulers of the congregation came and told moses and he said unto them this is that which the lord hath spoken to morrow is a solemn rest a holy sabbath unto the lord bake that which ye will bake and seethe that which ye will seethe and all that remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning and they laid it up till the morning as moses bade and it did not rot neither was there any worm therein and moses said eat that to day for to day is a sabbath unto the lord to day ye shall not find it in the field six days ye shall gather it but on the seventh day is the sabbath in it there shall be none and it came to pass on the seventh day that there went out some of the people to gather and they found none s and the lord said unto moses how long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws see that the lord hath given you the sabbath therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days abide ye every man in his place let no man go out of his place on the seventh day so the people rested on the seventh day and the house of israel called the name thereof manna and it was like coriander seed white and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey and moses said this is the thing which the lord hath commanded let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations that they may see the bread wherewith i fed you in the wilderness when i brought you forth from the land of egypt and moses said unto aaron take a jar and put an omerful of manna therein and lay it up before the lord to be kept throughout your generations as the lord commanded moses so aaron laid it up before the testimony to be kept and the children of israel did eat the manna forty years until they came to a land inhabited they did eat the manna until they came unto the borders of the land of canaan now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah and all the congregation of the children of israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin by their stages according to the commandment of the lord and encamped in rephidim and there was no water for the people to drink wherefore the people strove with moses and said give us water that we may drink and moses said unto them why strive ye with me wherefore do ye try the lord and the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against moses and said wherefore hast thou brought us up out of egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst and moses cried unto the lord saying what shall i do unto this people they are almost ready to stone me and the lord said unto moses pass on before the people and take with thee of the elders of israel and thy rod wherewith thou smotest the river take in thy hand and go behold i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeb and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel and the name of the place was called massah and meribah because of the striving of the children of israel and because they tried the lord saying is the lord among us or not then came amalek and fought with israel in rephidim and moses said unto joshua choose us out men and go out fight with amalek tomorrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of god in my hand so joshua did as moses had said to him and fought with amalek and moses aaron and hur went up to the top of the hill and it came to pass when moses held up his hand that israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed but moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat thereon and aaron and hur stayed up his hands the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun and joshua discomfited amalek and his people with the edge of the sword and the lord said unto moses write this for a memorial in the book and rehearse it in the ears of joshua for i will utterly blot out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven and moses built an altar and called the name of it adonai nissi and he said the hand upon the throne of the lord the lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation now jethro the priest of midian moses father in law heard of all that god had done for moses and for israel his people how that the lord had brought israel out of egypt and jethro moses father in law took zipporah moses wife after he had sent her away and her two sons of whom the name of the one was gershom for he said i have been a stranger in a strange land and the name of the other was eliezer for the god of my father was my help and delivered me from the sword of pharaoh and jethro moses father in law came with his sons and his wife unto moses into the wilderness where he was encamped at the mount of god and he said unto moses i thy father in law jethro am coming unto thee and thy wife and her two sons with her and moses went out to meet his father in law and bowed down and kissed him and they asked each other of their welfare and they came into the tent and moses told his father in law all that the lord had done unto pharaoh and to the egyptians for israel s sake all the travail that had come upon them by the way and how the lord delivered them and jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the lord had done to israel in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the egyptians and jethro said blessed be the lord who hath delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of pharaoh who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the egyptians now i know that the lord is greater than all gods yea for that they dealt proudly against them and jethro moses father in law took a burnt offering and sacrifices for god and aaron came and all the elders of israel to eat bread with moses father in law before god and it came to pass on the morrow that moses sat to judge the people and the people stood about moses from the morning unto the evening and when moses father in law saw all that he did to the people he said what is this thing that thou doest to the people why sittest thou thyself alone and all the people stand about thee from morning unto even and moses said unto his father in law because the people come unto me to inquire of god when they have a matter it cometh unto me and i judge between a man and his neighbour and i make them know the statutes of god and his laws and moses father in law said unto him the thing that thou doest is not good thou wilt surely wear away both thou and this people that is with thee for the thing is too heavy for thee thou art not able to perform it thyself alone hearken now unto my voice i will give thee counsel and god be with thee be thou for the people before god and bring thou the causes unto god and thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk and the work that they must do moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men such as fear god men of truth hating unjust gain and place such over them to be rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tens and let them judge the people at all seasons and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring unto thee but every small matter they shall judge themselves so shall they make it easier for thee and bear the burden with thee if thou shalt do this thing and god command thee so then thou shalt be able to endure and all this people also shall go to their place in peace so moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law and did all that he had said and moses chose able men out of all israel and made them heads over the people rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tens and they judged the people at all seasons the hard causes they brought unto moses but every small matter they judged themselves and moses let his father in law depart and he went his way into his own land in the third month after the children of israel were gone forth out of the land of egypt the same day came they into the wilderness of sinai and when they were departed from rephidim and were come to the wilderness of sinai they encamped in the wilderness and there israel encamped before the mount and moses went up unto god and the lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob and tell the children of israel ye have seen what i did unto the egyptians and how i bore you on eagles wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if ye will hearken unto my voice indeed and keep my covenant then ye shall be mine own treasure from among all peoples for all the earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel and moses came and called for the elders of the people and set before them all these words which the lord commanded him and all the people answered together and said all that the lord hath spoken we will do and moses reported the words of the people unto the lord and the lord said unto moses lo i come unto thee in a thick cloud that the people may hear when i speak with thee and may also believe thee for ever and moses told the words of the people unto the lord and the lord said unto moses go unto the people and sanctify them to day and to morrow and let them wash their garments and be ready against the third day for the third day the lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about saying take heed to yourselves that ye go not up into the mount or touch the border of it whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death no hand shall touch him but he shall surely be stoned or shot through whether it be beast or man it shall not live when the ram s horn soundeth long they shall come up to the mount and moses went down from the mount unto the people and sanctified the people and they washed their garments and he said unto the people be ready against the third day come not near a woman and it came to pass on the third day when it was morning that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount and the voice of a horn exceeding loud and all the people that were in the camp trembled and moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet god and they stood at the nether part of the mount now mount sinai was altogether on smoke because the lord descended upon it in fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole mount quaked greatly and when the voice of the horn waxed louder and louder moses spoke and god answered him by a voice and the lord came down upon mount sinai to the top of the mount and the lord called moses to the top of the mount and moses went up and the lord said unto moses go down charge the people lest they break through unto the lord to gaze and many of them perish and let the priests also that come near to the lord sanctify themselves lest the lord break forth upon them and moses said unto the lord the people cannot come up to mount sinai for thou didst charge us saying set bounds about the mount and sanctify it and the lord said unto him go get thee down and thou shalt come up thou and aaron with thee but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the lord lest he break forth upon them so moses went down unto the people and told them s and god spoke all these words saying s i am the lord thy god who brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage thou shalt have no other gods before me thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image nor any manner of likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth thou

thunderings and the lightnings and the voice of the horn and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they trembled and stood afar off and they said unto moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not god speak with us lest we die and moses said unto the people fear not for god is come to prove you and that his fear may be before you that ye sin not and the people stood afar off but moses drew near unto the thick darkness where god was s and the lord said unto moses thus thou shalt say unto the children of israel ye yourselves have seen that i have talked with you from heaven

have filled him with the spirit of god in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship to devise skilful works to work in gold and in silver and in brass and in cutting of stones for setting and in carving of wood to work in all manner of workmanship and i behold i have appointed with him oholiab the son of ahisamach of the tribe of dan and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted i have put wisdom that they may make all that i have commanded thee the tent of meeting and the ark of the testimony and the ark cover that is thereupon and all the furniture of the tent and the table and its vessels and the pure candlestick with all its vessels and the altar of incense and the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels and the laver and its base and the plaited garments and the holy garments for aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to minister in the priest s office and the anointing oil and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place according to all that i have commanded thee shall they do and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak thou also unto the children of israel saying verily ye shall keep my sabbaths for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations that ye may know that i am the lord who sanctify you ye shall keep the sabbath therefore for it is holy unto you every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death for whosoever doeth any work therein that soul shall be cut off from among his people six days shall work be done but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest holy to the lord whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day he shall surely be put to death wherefore the children of israel shall keep the sabbath to observe the sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant it is a sign between me and the children of israel for ever for in six days the lord made heaven and earth and on the seventh day he ceased from work and rested s and he gave unto moses when he had made an end of speaking with him upon mount sinai the two tables of the testimony tables of stone written with the finger of god and when the people saw that moses delayed to come down from the mount the people gathered themselves together unto aaron and said unto him up make us a god who shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we know not what is become of him and aaron said unto them break off the golden rings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto me and all the people broke off the golden rings which were in their ears and brought them unto aaron and he received it at their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool and made it a molten calf and they said this is thy god o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt and when aaron saw this he built an altar before it and aaron made proclamation and said to morrow shall be a feast to the lord and they rose up early on the morrow and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to make merry and the lord spoke unto moses go get thee down for thy people that thou broughtest up out of the land of egypt have dealt corruptly they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten calf and have worshipped it and have sacrificed unto it and said this is thy god o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt and the lord said unto moses i have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked people now therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax hot against them and that i may consume them and i will make of thee a great nation and moses besought the lord his god and said lord why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people that thou hast brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand wherefore should the egyptians speak saying for evil did he bring them forth to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people remember abraham isaac and israel thy servants to whom thou didst swear by thine own self and saidst unto them i will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that i have spoken of will i give unto your seed and they shall inherit it for ever and the lord repented of the evil which he said he would do unto his people and moses turned and went down from the mount with the two tables of the testimony in his hand tables that were written on both their sides on the one side and on the other were they written and the tables were the work of god and the writing was the writing of god graven upon the tables and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said unto moses there is a noise of war in the camp and he said it is not the voice of them that shout for mastery neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the noise of them that sing do i hear and it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and moses anger waxed hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and broke them beneath the mount and he took the calf which they had made and burnt it with fire and ground it to powder and strewed it upon the water and made the children of israel drink of it and moses said unto aaron what did this people unto thee that thou hast brought a great sin upon them and aaron said let not the anger of my lord wax hot thou knowest the people that they are set on evil so they said unto me make us a god which shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we know not what is become of him and i said unto them whosoever hath any gold let them break it off so they gave it me and i cast it into the fire and there came out this calf and when moses saw that the people were broken loose for aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies then moses stood in the gate of the camp and said whoso is on the lord s side let him come unto me and all the sons of levi gathered themselves together unto him and he said unto them thus saith the lord the god of israel put ye every man his sword upon his thigh and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man his companion and every man his neighbour and the sons of levi did according to the word of moses and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men and moses said consecrate yourselves to day to the lord for every man hath been against his son and against his brother that he may also bestow upon you a blessing this day and it came to pass on the morrow that moses said unto the people ye have sinned a great sin and now i will go up unto the lord peradventure i shall make atonement for your sin and moses returned unto the lord and said oh this people have sinned a great sin and have made them a god of gold yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin and if not blot me i pray thee out of thy book which thou hast written and the lord said unto moses whosoever hath sinned against me him will i blot out of my book and now go lead the people unto the place of which i have spoken unto thee behold mine angel shall go before thee nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit their sin upon them and the lord smote the people because they made the calf which aaron made s and the lord spoke unto moses depart go up hence thou and the people that thou hast brought up out of the land of egypt unto the land of which i swore unto abraham to isaac and to jacob saying unto thy seed will i give it and i will send an angel before thee and i will drive out the canaanite the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite unto a land flowing with milk and honey for i will not go up in the midst of thee for thou art a stiffnecked people lest i consume thee in the way and when the people heard these evil tidings they mourned and no man did put on him his ornaments and the lord said unto moses say unto the children of israel ye are a stiffnecked people if i go up into the midst of thee for one moment i shall consume thee therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee that i may know what to do unto thee and the children of israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount horeb onward now moses used to take the tent and to pitch it without the camp afar off from the camp and he called it the tent of meeting and it came to pass that every one that sought the lord went out unto the tent of meeting which was without the camp and it came to pass when moses went out unto the tent that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and looked after moses until he was gone into the tent and it came to pass when moses entered into the tent the pillar of cloud descended and stood at the door of the tent and the lord spoke with moses and when all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the tent all the people rose up and worshipped every man at his tent door and the lord spoke unto moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he would return into the camp but his minister joshua the son of nun a young man departed not out of the tent and moses said unto the lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me yet thou hast said i know thee by name and thou hast also found grace in my sight now therefore i pray thee if i have found grace in thy sight show me now thy ways that i may know thee to the end that i may find grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people and he said my presence shall go with thee and i will give thee rest and he said unto him if thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence for wherein now shall it be known that i have found grace in thy sight i and thy people is it not in that thou goest with us so that we are distinguished i and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth and the lord said unto moses i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight and i know thee by name and he said show me i pray thee thy glory and he said i will make all my goodness pass before thee and will proclaim the name of the lord before thee and i will be gracious to whom i will be gracious and will show mercy on whom i will show mercy and he said thou canst not see my face for man shall not see me and live and the lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon the rock and it shall come to pass while my glory passeth by that i will put thee in a cleft of the rock and will cover thee with my hand until i have passed by and i will take away my hand and thou shalt see my back but my face shall not be seen and the lord said unto moses hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first and i will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou didst break and be ready by the morning and come up in the morning unto mount sinai and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount and no man shall come up with thee neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and moses rose up early in the morning and went up unto mount sinai as the lord had commanded him and took in his hand two tables of stone and the lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the lord and the lord passed by before him and proclaimed the lord the lord god merciful and gracious long suffering and abundant in goodness and truth keeping mercy unto the thousandth generation forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the children s children unto the third and unto the fourth generation and moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped and he said if now i have found grace in thy sight o lord let the lord i pray thee go in the midst of us for it is a stiffnecked people and pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for thine inheritance and he said behold i make a covenant before all thy people i will do marvels such as have not been wrought in all the earth nor in any nation and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the lord that i am about to do with thee that it is tremendous observe thou that which i am commanding thee this day behold i am driving out before thee the amorite and the canaanite and the hittite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite take heed to thyself lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest lest they be for a snare in the midst of thee but ye shall break down their altars and dash in pieces their pillars and ye shall cut down their asherim for thou shalt bow down to no other god for the lord whose name is jealous is a jealous god lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they go astray after their gods and do sacrifice unto their gods and they call thee and thou eat of their sacrifice and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons and their daughters go astray after their gods and make thy sons go astray after their gods thou shalt make thee no molten gods the feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread as i commanded thee at the time appointed in the month abib for in the month abib thou camest out from egypt all that openeth the womb is mine and of all thy cattle thou shalt sanctify the males the firstlings of ox and sheep and the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou wilt not redeem it then thou shalt break its neck all the first born of thy sons thou shalt redeem and none shall appear before me empty six days thou shalt work but on the seventh day thou shalt rest in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest and thou shalt observe the feast of weeks even of the first fruits of wheat harvest and the feast of ingathering at the turn of the year three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the lord god the god of israel for i will cast out nations before thee and enlarge thy borders neither shall any man covet thy land when thou goest up to appear before the lord thy god three times in the year thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning the choicest first fruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the lord thy god thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother s milk and the lord said unto moses write thou these words for after the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with thee and with israel and he was there with the lord forty days and forty nights he did neither eat bread nor drink water and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant the ten words and it came to pass when moses came down from mount sinai with the two tables of the testimony in moses hand when he came down from the mount that moses knew not that the skin of his face sent forth beams while he talked with him and when aaron and all the children of israel saw moses behold the skin of his face sent forth beams and they were afraid to come nigh him and moses called unto them and aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him and moses spoke to them and afterward all the children of israel came nigh and he gave them in commandment all that the lord had spoken with him in mount sinai and when moses had done speaking with them he put a veil on his face but when moses went in before the lord that he might speak with him he took the veil off until he came out and he came out and spoke unto the children of israel that which he was commanded and the children of israel saw the face of moses that the skin of moses face sent forth beams and moses put the veil back upon his face until he went in to speak with him s and moses assembled all the congregation of the children of israel and said unto them these are the words which the lord hath commanded that ye should do them six days shall work be done but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day a sabbath of solemn rest to the lord whosoever doeth any work therein shall be put to death ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day and moses spoke unto all the congregation of the children of israel saying this is the thing which the lord commanded saying take ye from among you an offering unto the lord whosoever is of a willing heart let him bring it the lord s offering gold and silver and brass and blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and goats hair and rams skins dyed red and sealskins and acacia wood and oil for the light and spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense and onyx stones and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate and let every wise hearted man

the tent of meeting and for all the service thereof and for the holy garments and they came both men and women as many as were willing hearted and brought nose rings and ear rings and signet rings and girdles all jewels of gold even every man that brought an offering of gold unto the lord and every man with whom was found blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and goats hair and rams skins dyed

commanded by the hand of moses to be made and moses said unto the children of israel see the lord hath called by name bezalel the son of uri the son of hur of the tribe of judah and he hath filled him with the spirit of god in wisdom in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship and to devise skilful works to work in gold and in silver and in brass and in cutting of stones for setting and in carving of wood to work in all manner of skilful workmanship and he hath put in his heart that he may teach both he and oholiab the son of ahisamach of the tribe of dan them hath he

weaver even of them that do any workmanship and of those that devise skilful works and bezalel and oholiab shall work and every wise hearted man in whom the lord hath put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary according to all that the lord hath commanded and moses called bezalel and oholiab and every wise hearted man in whose heart the lord had put wisdom even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it and they received of moses all the offering which the children of israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary wherewith to make it and they brought yet unto him freewill offerings every morning and all the wise men that wrought all the work of the sanctuary came every man from his work which they wrought and they spoke unto moses saying the people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which the lord commanded to make and moses gave commandment and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp saying let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary so the people were restrained from bringing for the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it and too much s and every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet with cherubim the work of the skilful workman made he them the length of each curtain was eight and twenty cubits and the breadth of each curtain four cubits all the curtains had one measure and he coupled
