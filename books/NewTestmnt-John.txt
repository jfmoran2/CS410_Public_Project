in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth john bare witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom i spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me and of his fulness have all we received and grace for grace for the law was given by moses but grace and truth came by jesus christ no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him and this is the record of john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him who art thou and he confessed and denied not but confessed i am not the christ and they asked him what then art thou elias and he saith i am not art thou that prophet and he answered no then said they unto him who art thou that we may give an answer to them that sent us what sayest thou of thyself he said i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the lord as said the prophet esaias and they which were sent were of the pharisees and they asked him and said unto him why baptizest thou then if thou be not that christ nor elias neither that prophet john answered them saying i baptize with water but there standeth one among you whom ye know not he it is who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoe s latchet i am not worthy to unloose these things were done in bethabara beyond jordan where john was baptizing the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore am i come baptizing with water and john bare record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost and i saw and bare record that this is the son of god again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples and looking upon jesus as he walked he saith behold the lamb of god and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed jesus then jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto them what seek ye they said unto him rabbi which is to say being interpreted master where dwellest thou he saith unto them come and see they came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hour one of the two which heard john speak and followed him was andrew simon peter s brother he first findeth his own brother simon and saith unto him we have found the messias which is being interpreted the christ and he brought him to jesus and when jesus beheld him he said thou art simon the son of jona thou shalt be called cephas which is by interpretation a stone the day following jesus would go forth into galilee and findeth philip and saith unto him follow me now philip was of bethsaida the city of andrew and peter philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him of whom moses in the law and the prophets did write jesus of nazareth the son of joseph and nathanael said unto him can there any good thing come out of nazareth philip saith unto him come and see jesus saw nathanael coming to him and saith of him behold an israelite indeed in whom is no guile nathanael saith unto him whence knowest thou me jesus answered and said unto him before that philip called thee when thou wast under the fig tree i saw thee nathanael answered and saith unto him rabbi thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel jesus answered and said unto him because i said unto thee i saw thee under the fig tree believest thou thou shalt see greater things than these and he saith unto him verily verily i say unto you hereafter ye shall see heaven open and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee and the mother of jesus was there and both jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage and when they wanted wine the mother of jesus saith unto him they have no wine jesus saith unto her woman what have i to do with thee mine hour is not yet come his mother saith unto the servants whatsoever he saith unto you do it and there were set there six waterpots of stone after the manner of the purifying of the jews containing two or three firkins apiece jesus saith unto them fill the waterpots with water and they filled them up to the brim and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast and they bare it when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not whence it was but the servants which drew the water knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroom and saith unto him every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine and when men have well drunk then that which is worse but thou hast kept the good wine until now this beginning of miracles did jesus in cana of galilee and manifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on him after this he went down to capernaum he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples and they continued there not many days and the jews passover was at hand and jesus went up to jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the changers of money sitting and when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the tables and said unto them that sold doves take these things hence make not my father s house an house of merchandise and his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up then answered the jews and said unto him what sign shewest thou unto us seeing that thou doest these things jesus answered and said unto them destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up then said the jews forty and six years was this temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in three days but he spake of the temple of his body when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them and they believed the scripture and the word which jesus had said now when he was in jerusalem at the passover in the feast day many believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he did but jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew all men and needed not that any should testify of man for he knew what was in man there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother s womb and be born jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is every one that is born of the spirit nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be jesus answered and said unto him art thou a master of israel and knowest not these things verily verily i say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye receive not our witness if i have told you earthly things and ye believe not how shall ye believe if i tell you of heavenly things and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of judaea and there he tarried with them and baptized and john also was baptizing in aenon near to salim because there was much water there and they came and were baptized for john was not yet cast into prison then there arose a question between some of john s disciples and the jews about purifying and they came unto john and said unto him rabbi he that was with thee beyond jordan to whom thou barest witness behold the same baptizeth and all men come to him john answered and said a man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven ye yourselves bear me witness that i said i am not the christ but that i am sent before him he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom s voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled he must increase but i must decrease he that cometh from above is above all he that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from heaven is above all and what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth and no man receiveth his testimony he that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that god is true for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god for god giveth not the spirit by measure unto him the father loveth the son and hath given all things into his hand he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard that jesus made and baptized more disciples than john though jesus himself baptized not but his disciples he left judaea and departed again into galilee and he must needs go through samaria then cometh he to a city of samaria which is called sychar near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph now jacob s well was there jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her give me to drink for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat then saith the woman of samaria unto him how is it that thou being a jew askest drink of me which am a woman of samaria for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living water the woman saith unto him sir thou hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water art thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that i thirst not neither come hither to draw jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said i have no husband jesus said unto her thou hast well said i have no husband for thou hast had five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband in that saidst thou truly the woman saith unto him sir i perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshipped in this mountain and ye say that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth the woman saith unto him i know that messias cometh which is called christ when he is come he will tell us all things jesus saith unto her i that speak unto thee am he and upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why talkest thou with her the woman then left her waterpot and went her way into the city and saith to the men come see a man which told me all things that ever i did is not this the christ then they went out of the city and came unto him in the mean while his disciples prayed him saying master eat but he said unto them i have meat to eat that ye know not of therefore said the disciples one to another hath any man brought him ought to eat jesus saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work say not ye there are yet four months and then cometh harvest behold i say unto you lift up your eyes and look on the fields for they are white already to harvest and he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life eternal that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together and herein is that saying true one soweth and another reapeth i sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour other men laboured and ye are entered into their labours and many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that ever i did so when the samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he would tarry with them and he abode there two days and many more believed because of his own word and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the christ the saviour of the world now after two days he departed thence and went into galilee for jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honour in his own country then when he was come into galilee the galilaeans received him having seen all the things that he did at jerusalem at the feast for they also went unto the feast so jesus came again into cana of galilee where he made the water wine and there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at capernaum when he heard that jesus was come out of judaea into galilee he went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death then said jesus unto him except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe the nobleman saith unto him sir come down ere my child die jesus saith unto him go thy way thy son liveth and the man believed the word that jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way and as he was now going down his servants met him and told him saying thy son liveth then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend and they said unto him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him so the father knew that it was at the same hour in the which jesus said unto him thy son liveth and himself believed and his whole house this is again the second miracle that jesus did when he was come out of judaea into galilee after this there was a feast of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is called in the hebrew tongue bethesda having five porches in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had and a certain man was there which had an infirmity thirty and eight years when jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole the impotent man answered him sir i have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while i am coming another steppeth down before me jesus saith unto him rise take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the sabbath the jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed he answered them he that made me whole the same said unto me take up thy bed and walk then asked they him what man is that which said unto thee take up thy bed and walk and he that was healed wist not who it was for jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in that place afterward jesus findeth him in the temple and said unto him behold thou art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing come unto thee the man departed and told the jews that it was jesus which had made him whole and therefore did the jews persecute jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the sabbath day but jesus answered them my father worketh hitherto and i work therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath but said also that god was his father making himself equal with god then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise for the father loveth the son and sheweth him all things that himself doeth and he will shew him greater works than these that ye may marvel for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the son quickeneth whom he will for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son that all men should honour the son even as they honour the father he that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath sent him verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself and hath given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation i can of mine own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which hath sent me if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true there is another that beareth witness of me and i know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true ye sent unto john and he bare witness unto the truth but i receive not testimony from man but these things i say that ye might be saved he was a burning and a shining light and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light but i have greater witness than that of john for the works which the father hath given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me and the father himself which hath sent me hath borne witness of me ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape and ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath sent him ye believe not search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of me and ye will not come to me that ye might have life i receive not honour from men but i know you that ye have not the love of god in you i am come in my father s name and ye receive me not if another shall come in his own name him ye will receive how can ye believe which receive honour one of another and seek not the honour that cometh from god only do not think that i will accuse you to the father there is one that accuseth you even moses in whom ye trust for had ye believed moses ye would have believed me for he wrote of me but if ye believe not his writings how shall ye believe my words after these things jesus went over the sea of galilee which is the sea of tiberias and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased and jesus went up into a mountain and there he sat with his disciples and the passover a feast of the jews was nigh when jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him he saith unto philip whence shall we buy bread that these may eat and this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do philip answered him two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little one of his disciples andrew simon peter s brother saith unto him there is a lad here which hath five barley loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many and jesus said make the men sit down now there was much grass in the place so the men sat down in number about five thousand and jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were set down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would when they were filled he said unto his disciples gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost therefore they gathered them together and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eaten then those men when they had seen the miracle that jesus did said this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world when jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself alone and when even was now come his disciples went down unto the sea and entered into a ship and went over the sea toward capernaum and it was now dark and jesus was not come to them and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew so when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs they see jesus walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship and they were afraid but he saith unto them it is i be not afraid then they willingly received him into the ship and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went the day following when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there save that one whereinto his disciples were entered and that jesus went not with his disciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away alone howbeit there came other boats from tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread after that the lord had given thanks when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took shipping and came to capernaum seeking for jesus and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him rabbi when camest thou hither jesus answered them and said verily verily i say unto you ye seek me not because ye saw the miracles but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent they said therefore unto him what sign shewest thou then that we may see and believe thee what dost thou work our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world then said they unto him lord evermore give us this bread and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst but i said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the father s will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day the jews then murmured at him because he said i am the bread which came down from heaven and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith i came down from heaven jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of god he hath seen the father verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life i am that bread of life your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world the jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him as the living father hath sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernaum many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is an hard saying who can hear it when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them doth this offend you what and if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him then said jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art that christ the son of the living god jesus answered them have not i chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil he spake of judas iscariot the son of simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve after these things jesus walked in galilee for he would not walk in jewry because the jews sought to kill him now the jews feast of tabernacles was at hand his brethren therefore said unto him depart hence and go into judaea that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly if thou do these things shew thyself to the world for neither did his brethren believe in him then jesus said unto them my time is not yet come but your time is alway ready the world cannot hate you but me it hateth because i testify of it that the works thereof are evil go ye up unto this feast i go not up yet unto this feast for my time is not yet full come when he had said these words unto them he abode still in galilee but when his brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the feast not openly but as it were in secret then the jews sought him at the feast and said where is he and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him for some said he is a good man others said nay but he deceiveth the people howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple and taught and the jews marvelled saying how knoweth this man letters having never learned jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him did not moses give you the law and yet none of you keepeth the law why go ye about to kill me the people answered and said thou hast a devil who goeth about to kill thee jesus answered and said unto them i have done one work and ye all marvel moses therefore gave unto you circumcision not because it is of moses but of the fathers and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man if a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision that the law of moses should not be broken are ye angry at me because i have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment then said some of them of jerusalem is not this he whom they seek to kill but lo he speaketh boldly and they say nothing unto him do the rulers know indeed that this is the very christ howbeit we know this man whence he is but when christ cometh no man knoweth whence he is then cried jesus in the temple as he taught saying ye both know me and ye know whence i am and i am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom ye know not but i know him for i am from him and he hath sent me then they sought to take him but no man laid hands on him because his hour was not yet come and many of the people believed on him and said when christ cometh will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done the pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him and the pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him then said jesus unto them yet a little while am i with you and then i go unto him that sent me ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither ye cannot come then said the jews among themselves whither will he go that we shall not find him will he go unto the dispersed among the gentiles and teach the gentiles what manner of saying is this that he said ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither ye cannot come in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified many of the people therefore when they heard this saying said of a truth this is the prophet others said this is the christ but some said shall christ come out of galilee hath not the scripture said that christ cometh of the seed of david and out of the town of bethlehem where david was so there was a division among the people because of him and some of them would have taken him but no man laid hands on him then came the officers to the chief priests and pharisees and they said unto them why have ye not brought him the officers answered never man spake like this man then answered them the pharisees are ye also deceived have any of the rulers or of the pharisees believed on him but this people who knoweth not the law are cursed nicodemus saith unto them he that came to jesus by night being one of them doth our law judge any man before it hear him and know what he doeth they answered and said unto him art thou also of galilee search and look for out of galilee ariseth no prophet and every man went unto his own house jesus went unto the mount of olives and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst they say unto him master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act now moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst when jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee she said no man lord and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more then spake jesus again unto them saying i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life the pharisees therefore said unto him thou bearest record of thyself thy record is not true jesus answered and said unto them though i bear record of myself yet my record is true for i know whence i came and whither i go but ye cannot tell whence i come and whither i go ye judge after the flesh i judge no man and yet if i judge my judgment is true for i am not alone but i and the father that sent me it is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true i am one that bear witness of myself and the father that sent me beareth witness of me then said they unto him where is thy father jesus answered ye neither know me nor my father if ye had known me ye should have known my father also these words spake jesus in the treasury as he taught in the temple and no man laid hands on him for his hour was not yet come then said jesus again unto them i go my way and ye shall seek me and shall die in your sins whither i go ye cannot come then said the jews will he kill himself because he saith whither i go ye cannot come and he said unto them ye are from beneath i am from above ye are of this world i am not of this world i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins then said they unto him who art thou and jesus saith unto them even the same that i said unto you from the beginning i have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sent me is true and i speak to the world those things which i have heard of him they understood not that he spake to them of the father then said jesus unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall ye know that i am he and that i do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for i do always those things that please him as he spake these words many believed on him then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be abraham s seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house for ever but the son abideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed i know that ye are abraham s seed but ye seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you i speak that which i have seen with my father and ye do that which ye have seen with your father they answered and said unto him abraham is our father jesus saith unto them if ye were abraham s children ye would do the works of abraham but now ye seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham ye do the deeds of your father then said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even god jesus said unto them if god were your father ye would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me why do ye not understand my speech even because ye cannot hear my word ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because i tell you the truth ye believe me not which of you convinceth me of sin and if i say the truth why do ye not believe me he that is of god heareth god s words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of god then answered the jews and said unto him say we not well that thou art a samaritan and hast a devil jesus answered i have not a devil but i honour my father and ye do dishonour me and i seek not mine own glory there is one that seeketh and judgeth verily verily i say unto you if a man keep my saying he shall never see death then said the jews unto him now we know that thou hast a devil abraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayest if a man keep my saying he shall never taste of death art thou greater than our father abraham which is dead and the prophets are dead whom makest thou thyself jesus answered if i honour myself my honour is nothing it is my father that honoureth me of whom ye say that he is your god yet ye have not known him but i know him and if i should say i know him not i shall be a liar like unto you but i know him and keep his saying your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad then said the jews unto him thou art not yet fifty years old and hast thou seen abraham jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you before abraham was i am then took they up stones to cast at him but jesus hid himself and went out of the temple going through the midst of them and so passed by and as jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind jesus answered neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him i must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world when he had thus spoken he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay and said unto him go wash in the pool of siloam which is by interpretation sent he went his way therefore and washed and came seeing the neighbours therefore and they which before had seen him that he was blind said is not this he that sat and begged some said this is he others said he is like him but he said i am he therefore said they unto him how were thine eyes opened he answered and said a man that is called jesus made clay and anointed mine eyes and said unto me go to the pool of siloam and wash and i went and washed and i received sight then said they unto him where is he he said i know not they brought to the pharisees him that aforetime was blind and it was the sabbath day when jesus made the clay and opened his eyes then again the pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight he said unto them he put clay upon mine eyes and i washed and do see therefore said some of the pharisees this man is not of god because he keepeth not the sabbath day others said how can a man that is a sinner do such miracles and there was a division among them they say unto the blind man again what sayest thou of him that he hath opened thine eyes he said he is a prophet but the jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received his sight until they called the parents of him that had received his sight and they asked them saying is this your son who ye say was born blind how then doth he now see his parents answered them and said we know that this is our son and that he was born blind but by what means he now seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak for himself these words spake his parents because they feared the jews for the jews had agreed already that if any man did confess that he was christ he should be put out of the synagogue therefore said his parents he is of age ask him then again called they the man that was blind and said unto him give god the praise we know that this man is a sinner he answered and said whether he be a sinner or no i know not one thing i know that whereas i was blind now i see then said they to him again what did he to thee how opened he thine eyes he answered them i have told you already and ye did not hear wherefore would ye hear it again will ye also be his disciples then they reviled him and said thou art his disciple but we are moses disciples we know that god spake unto moses as for this fellow we know not from whence he is the man answered and said unto them why herein is a marvellous thing that ye know not from whence he is and yet he hath opened mine eyes now we know that god heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshipper of god and doeth his will him he heareth since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind if this man were not of god he could do nothing they answered and said unto him thou wast altogether born in sins and dost thou teach us and they cast him out jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him dost thou believe on the son of god he answered and said who is he lord that i might believe on him and jesus said unto him thou hast both seen him and it is he that talketh with thee and he said lord i believe and he worshipped him and jesus said for judgment i am come into this world that they which see not might see and that they which see might be made blind and some of the pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him are we blind also jesus said unto them if ye were blind ye should have no sin but now ye say we see therefore your sin remaineth verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers this parable spake jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them then said jesus unto them again verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy i am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep but he that is an hireling and not the shepherd whose own the sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep the hireling fleeth because he is an hireling and careth not for the sheep i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine as the father knoweth me even so know i the father and i lay down my life for the sheep and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it again no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again this commandment have i received of my father there was a division therefore again among the jews for these sayings and many of them said he hath a devil and is mad why hear ye him others said these are not the words of him that hath a devil can a devil open the eyes of the blind and it was at jerusalem the feast of the dedication and it was winter and jesus walked in the temple in solomon s porch then came the jews round about him and said unto him how long dost thou make us to doubt if thou be the christ tell us plainly jesus answered them i told you and ye believed not the works that i do in my father s name they bear witness of me but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as i said unto you my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father s hand i and my father are one then the jews took up stones again to stone him jesus answered them many good works have i shewed you from my father for which of those works do ye stone me the jews answered him saying for a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy and because that thou being a man makest thyself god jesus answered them is it not written in your law i said ye are gods if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken say ye of him whom the father hath sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemest because i said i am the son of god if i do not the works of my father believe me not but if i do though ye believe not me believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and i in him therefore they sought again to take him but he escaped out of their hand and went away again beyond jordan into the place where john at first baptized and there he abode and many resorted unto him and said john did no miracle but all things that john spake of this man were true and many believed on him there now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany the town of mary and her sister martha it was that mary which anointed the lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick therefore his sisters sent unto him saying lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick when jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby now jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus when he had heard therefore that he was sick he abode two days still in the same place where he was then after that saith he to his disciples let us go into judaea again his disciples say unto him master the jews of late sought to stone thee and goest thou thither again jesus answered are there not twelve hours in the day if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him these things said he and after that he saith unto them our friend lazarus sleepeth but i go that i may awake him out of sleep then said his disciples lord if he sleep he shall do well howbeit jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep then said jesus unto them plainly lazarus is dead and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there to the intent ye may believe nevertheless let us go unto him then said thomas which is called didymus unto his fellowdisciples let us also go that we may die with him then when jesus came he found that he had lain in the grave four days already now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem about fifteen furlongs off and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort them concerning their brother then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but mary sat still in the house then said martha unto jesus lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died but i know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of god god will give it thee jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this she saith unto him yea lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world and when she had so said she went her way and called mary her sister secretly saying the master is come and calleth for thee as soon as she heard that she arose quickly and came unto him now jesus was not yet come into the town but was in that place where martha met him the jews then which were with her in the house and comforted her when they saw mary that she rose up hastily and went out followed her saying she goeth unto the grave to weep there then when mary was come where jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died when jesus therefore saw her weeping and the jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said where have ye laid him they said unto him lord come and see jesus wept then said the jews behold how he loved him and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it jesus said take ye away the stone martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been dead four days jesus saith unto her said i not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of god then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid and jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee that thou hast heard me and i knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by i said it that they may believe that thou hast sent me and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with graveclothes and his face was bound about with a napkin jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go then many of the jews which came to mary and had seen the things which jesus did believed on him but some of them went their ways to the pharisees and told them what things jesus had done then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees a council and said what do we for this man doeth many miracles if we let him thus alone all men will believe on him and the romans shall come and take away both our place and nation and one of them named caiaphas being the high priest that same year said unto them ye know nothing at all nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not and this spake he not of himself but being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus should die for that nation and not for that nation only but that also he should gather together in one the children of god that were scattered abroad then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness into a city called ephraim and there continued with his disciples and the jews passover was nigh at hand and many went out of the country up to jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves then sought they for jesus and spake among themselves as they stood in the temple what think ye that he will not come to the feast now both the chief priests and the pharisees had given a commandment that if any man knew where he were he should shew it that they might take him then jesus six days before the passover came to bethany where lazarus was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead there they made him a supper and martha served but lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him then took mary a pound of ointment of spikenard very costly and anointed the feet of jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment then saith one of his disciples judas iscariot simon s son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bare what was put therein then said jesus let her alone against the day of my burying hath she kept this for the poor always ye have with you but me ye have not always much people of the jews therefore knew that he was there and they came not for jesus sake only but that they might see lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead but the chief priests consulted that they might put lazarus also to death because that by reason of him many of the jews went away and believed on jesus on the next day much people that were come to the feast when they heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried hosanna blessed is the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord and jesus when he had found a young ass sat thereon as it is written fear not daughter of sion behold thy king cometh sitting on an ass s colt these things understood not his disciples at the first but when jesus was glorified then remembered they that these things were written of him and that they had done these things unto him the people therefore that was with him when he called lazarus out of his grave and raised him from the dead bare record for this cause the people also met him for that they heard that he had done this miracle the pharisees therefore said among themselves perceive ye how ye prevail nothing behold the world is gone after him and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast the same came therefore to philip which was of bethsaida of galilee and desired him saying sir we would see jesus philip cometh and telleth andrew and again andrew and philip tell jesus and jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal if any man serve me let him follow me and where i am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honour now is my soul troubled and what shall i say father save me from this hour but for this cause came i unto this hour father glorify thy name then came there a voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and will glorify it again the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said an angel spake to him jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me this he said signifying what death he should die the people answered him we have heard out of the law that christ abideth for ever and how sayest thou the son of man must be lifted up who is this son of man then jesus said unto them yet a little while is the light with you walk while ye have the light lest darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth while ye have light believe in the light that ye may be the children of light these things spake jesus and departed and did hide himself from them but though he had done so many miracles before them yet they believed not on him that the saying of esaias the prophet might be fulfilled which he spake lord who hath believed our report and to whom hath the arm of the lord been revealed therefore they could not believe because that esaias said again he hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart and be converted and i should heal them these things said esaias when he saw his glory and spake of him nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him but because of the pharisees they did not confess him lest they should be put out of the synagogue for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of god jesus cried and said he that believeth on me believeth not on me but on him that sent me and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me i am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness and if any man hear my words and believe not i judge him not for i came not to judge the world but to save the world he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day for i have not spoken of myself but the father which sent me he gave me a commandment what i should say and what i should speak and i know that his commandment is life everlasting whatsoever i speak therefore even as the father said unto me so i speak now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simon s son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poureth water into a bason and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to simon peter and peter saith unto him lord dost thou wash my feet jesus answered and said unto him what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every whit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to you ye call me master and lord and ye say well for so i am if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another s feet for i have given you an example that ye should do as i have done to you verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them i speak not of you all i know whom i have chosen but that the scripture may be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me now i tell you before it come that when it is come to pass ye may believe that i am he verily verily i say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me when jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit and testified and said verily verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me then the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spake now there was leaning on jesus bosom one of his disciples whom jesus loved simon peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake he then lying on jesus breast saith unto him lord who is it jesus answered he it is to whom i shall give a sop when i have dipped it and when he had dipped the sop he gave it to judas iscariot the son of simon and after the sop satan entered into him then said jesus unto him that thou doest do quickly now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him for some of them thought because judas had the bag that jesus had said unto him buy those things that we have need of against the feast or that he should give something to the poor he then having received the sop went immediately out and it was night therefore when he was gone out jesus said now is the son of man glorified and god is glorified in him if god be glorified in him god shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him little children yet a little while i am with you ye shall seek me and as i said unto the jews whither i go ye cannot come so now i say to you a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another simon peter said unto him lord whither goest thou jesus answered him whither i go thou canst not follow me now but thou shalt follow me afterwards peter said unto him lord why cannot i follow thee now i will lay down my life for thy sake jesus answered him wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake verily verily i say unto thee the cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me in my father s house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also and whither i go ye know and the way ye know thomas saith unto him lord we know not whither thou goest and how can we know the way jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if ye had known me ye should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him philip saith unto him lord shew us the father and it sufficeth us jesus saith unto him have i been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou then shew us the father believest thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if ye shall ask any thing in my name i will do it if ye love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for ever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye in me and i in you he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him judas saith unto him not iscariot lord how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which ye hear is not mine but the father s which sent me these things have i spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid ye have heard how i said unto you i go away and come again unto you if ye loved me ye would rejoice because i said i go unto the father for my father is greater than i and now i have told you before it come to pass that when it is come to pass ye might believe hereafter i will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me but that the world may know that i love the father and as the father gave me commandment even so i do arise let us go hence i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples as the father hath loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love if ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father s commandments and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever i command you henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you these things i command you that ye love one another if the world hate you ye know that it hated me before it hated you if ye were of the world the world would love his own but because ye are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you remember the word that i said unto you the servant is not greater than his lord if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you if they have kept my saying they will keep yours also but all these things will they do unto you for my name s sake because they know not him that sent me if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin but now they have no cloak for their sin he that hateth me hateth my father also if i had not done among them the works which none other man did they had not had sin but now have they both seen and hated both me and my father but this cometh to pass that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law they hated me without a cause but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning these things have i spoken unto you that ye should not be offended they shall put you out of the synagogues yea the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth god service and these things will they do unto you because they have not known the father nor me but these things have i told you that when the time shall come ye may remember that i told you of them and these things i said not unto you at the beginning because i was with you but now i go my way to him that sent me and none of you asketh me whither goest thou but because i have said these things unto you sorrow hath filled your heart nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because i go to my father and ye see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will shew you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall shew it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall shew it unto you a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me because i go to the father then said some of his disciples among themselves what is this that he saith unto us a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me and because i go to the father they said therefore what is this that he saith a little while we cannot tell what he saith now jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them do ye enquire among yourselves of that i said a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world and ye now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you and in that day ye shall ask me nothing verily verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name he will give it you hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be full these things have i spoken unto you in proverbs but the time cometh when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs but i shall shew you plainly of the father at that day ye shall ask in my name and i say not unto you that i will pray the father for you for the father himself loveth you because ye have loved me and have believed that i came out from god i came forth from the father and am come into the world again i leave the world and go to the father his disciples said unto him lo now speakest thou plainly and speakest no proverb now are we sure that thou knowest all things and needest not that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou camest forth from god jesus answered them do ye now believe behold the hour cometh yea is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet i am not alone because the father is with me these things i have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world these words spake jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee as thou hast given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do and now o father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept thy word now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee for i have given unto them the words which thou gavest me and they have received them and have known surely that i came out from thee and they have believed that thou didst send me i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou hast given me for they are thine and all mine are thine and thine are mine and i am glorified in them and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i come to thee holy father keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are while i was with them in the world i kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me i have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled and now come i to thee and these things i speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves i have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world i pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as i am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth as thou hast sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me father i will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where i am that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world o righteous father the world hath not known thee but i have known thee and these have known that thou hast sent me and i have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and i in them when jesus had spoken these words he went forth with his disciples over the brook cedron where was a garden into the which he entered and his disciples and judas also which betrayed him knew the place for jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples judas then having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and pharisees cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons jesus therefore knowing all things that should come upon him went forth and said unto them whom seek ye they answered him jesus of nazareth jesus saith unto them i am he and judas also which betrayed him stood with them as soon then as he had said unto them i am he they went backward and fell to the ground then asked he them again whom seek ye and they said jesus of nazareth jesus answered i have told you that i am he if therefore ye seek me let these go their way that the saying might be fulfilled which he spake of them which thou gavest me have i lost none then simon peter having a sword drew it and smote the high priest s servant and cut off his right ear the servant s name was malchus then said jesus unto peter put up thy sword into the sheath the cup which my father hath given me shall i not drink it then the band and the captain and officers of the jews took jesus and bound him and led him away to annas first for he was father in law to caiaphas which was the high priest that same year now caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people and simon peter followed jesus and so did another disciple that disciple was known unto the high priest and went in with jesus into the palace of the high priest but peter stood at the door without then went out that other disciple which was known unto the high priest and spake unto her that kept the door and brought in peter then saith the damsel that kept the door unto peter art not thou also one of this man s disciples he saith i am not and the servants and officers stood there who had made a fire of coals for it was cold and they warmed themselves and peter stood with them and warmed himself the high priest then asked jesus of his disciples and of his doctrine jesus answered him i spake openly to the world i ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple whither the jews always resort and in secret have i said nothing why askest thou me ask them which heard me what i have said unto them behold they know what i said and when he had thus spoken one of the officers which stood by struck jesus with the palm of his hand saying answerest thou the high priest so jesus answered him if i have spoken evil bear witness of the evil but if well why smitest thou me now annas had sent him bound unto caiaphas the high priest and simon peter stood and warmed himself they said therefore unto him art not thou also one of his disciples he denied it and said i am not one of the servants of the high priest being his kinsman whose ear peter cut off saith did not i see thee in the garden with him peter then denied again and immediately the cock crew then led they jesus from caiaphas unto the hall of judgment and it was early and they themselves went not into the judgment hall lest they should be defiled but that they might eat the passover pilate then went out unto them and said what accusation bring ye against this man they answered and said unto him if he were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him up unto thee then said pilate unto them take ye him and judge him according to your law the jews therefore said unto him it is not lawful for us to put any man to death that the saying of jesus might be fulfilled which he spake signifying what death he should die then pilate entered into the judgment hall again and called jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the jews jesus answered him sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it thee of me pilate answered am i a jew thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then jesus answered thou sayest that i am a king to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth every one that is of the truth heareth my voice pilate saith unto him what is truth and when he had said this he went out again unto the jews and saith unto them i find in him no fault at all but ye have a custom that i should release unto you one at the passover will ye therefore that i release unto you the king of the jews then cried they all again saying not this man but barabbas now barabbas was a robber then pilate therefore took jesus and scourged him and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they put on him a purple robe and said hail king of the jews and they smote him with their hands pilate therefore went forth again and saith unto them behold i bring him forth to you that ye may know that i find no fault in him then came jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe and pilate saith unto them behold the man when the chief priests therefore and officers saw him they cried out saying crucify him crucify him pilate saith unto them take ye him and crucify him for i find no fault in him the jews answered him we have a law and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the son of god when pilate therefore heard that saying he was the more afraid and went again into the judgment hall and saith unto jesus whence art thou but jesus gave him no answer then saith pilate unto him speakest thou not unto me knowest thou not that i have power to crucify thee and have power to release thee jesus answered thou couldest have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin and from thenceforth pilate sought to release him but the jews cried out saying if thou let this man go thou art not caesar s friend whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar when pilate therefore heard that saying he brought jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement but in the hebrew gabbatha and it was the preparation of the passover and about the sixth hour and he saith unto the jews behold your king but they cried out away with him away with him crucify him pilate saith unto them shall i crucify your king the chief priests answered we have no king but caesar then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified and they took jesus and led him away and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull which is called in the hebrew golgotha where they crucified him and two other with him on either side one and jesus in the midst and pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross and the writing was jesus of nazareth the king of the jews this title then read many of the jews for the place where jesus was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in hebrew and greek and latin then said the chief priests of the jews to pilate write not the king of the jews but that he said i am king of the jews pilate answered what i have written i have written then the soldiers when they had crucified jesus took his garments and made four parts to every soldier a part and also his coat now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout they said therefore among themselves let us not rend it but cast lots for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith they parted my raiment among them and for my vesture they did cast lots these things therefore the soldiers did now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother and his mother s sister mary the wife of cleophas and mary magdalene when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a spunge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost the jews therefore because it was the preparation that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day for that sabbath day was an high day besought pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away then came the soldiers and brake the legs of the first and of the other which was crucified with him but when they came to jesus and saw that he was dead already they brake not his legs but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forthwith came there out blood and water and he that saw it bare record and his record is true and he knoweth that he saith true that ye might believe for these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled a bone of him shall not be broken and again another scripture saith they shall look on him whom they pierced and after this joseph of arimathaea being a disciple of jesus but secretly for fear of the jews besought pilate that he might take away the body of jesus and pilate gave him leave he came therefore and took the body of jesus and there came also nicodemus which at the first came to jesus by night and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound weight then took they the body of jesus and wound it in linen clothes with the spices as the manner of the jews is to bury now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new sepulchre wherein was never man yet laid there laid they jesus therefore because of the jews preparation day for the sepulchre was nigh at hand the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre then she runneth and cometh to simon peter and to the other disciple whom jesus loved and saith unto them they have taken away the lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid him peter therefore went forth and that other disciple and came to the sepulchre so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun peter and came first to the sepulchre and he stooping down and looking in saw the linen clothes lying yet went he not in then cometh simon peter following him and went into the sepulchre and seeth the linen clothes lie and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself then went in also that other disciple which came first to the sepulchre and he saw and believed for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead then the disciples went away again unto their own home but mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus had lain and they say unto her woman why weepest thou she saith unto them because they have taken away my lord and i know not where they have laid him and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus jesus saith unto her woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou she supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and i will take him away jesus saith unto her mary she turned herself and saith unto him rabboni which is to say master jesus saith unto her touch me not for i am not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my father and your father and to my god and your god mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord and that he had spoken these things unto her then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you and when he had so said he shewed unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the lord then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send i you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the holy ghost whose soever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whose soever sins ye retain they are retained but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them when jesus came the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the lord but he said unto them except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side i will not believe and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas with them then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you then saith he to thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god jesus saith unto him thomas because thou hast seen me thou hast believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing ye might have life through his name after these things jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias and on this wise shewed he himself there were together simon peter and thomas called didymus and nathanael of cana in galilee and the sons of zebedee and two other of his disciples simon peter saith unto them i go a fishing they say unto him we also go with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing but when the morning was now come jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was jesus then jesus saith unto them children have ye any meat they answered him no and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter it is the lord now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he girt his fisher s coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were two hundred cubits dragging the net with fishes as soon then as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid thereon and bread jesus saith unto them bring of the fish which ye have now caught simon peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes an hundred and fifty and three and for all there were so many yet was not the net broken jesus saith unto them come and dine and none of the disciples durst ask him who art thou knowing that it was the lord jesus then cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fish likewise this is now the third time that jesus shewed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead so when they had dined jesus saith to simon peter simon son of jonas lovest thou me more than these he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my lambs he saith to him again the second time simon son of jonas lovest thou me he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my sheep he saith unto him the third time simon son of jonas lovest thou me peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee jesus saith unto him feed my sheep verily verily i say unto thee when thou wast young thou girdedst thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest not this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify god and when he had spoken this he saith unto him follow me then peter turning about seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said lord which is he that betrayeth thee peter seeing him saith to jesus lord and what shall this man do jesus saith unto him if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee follow thou me then went this saying abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die yet jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee this is the disciple which testifieth of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true and there are also many other things which jesus did the which if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written amen
