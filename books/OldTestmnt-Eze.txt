now it came to pass in the thirtieth year in the fourth month in the fifth day of the month as i was among the captives by the river of chebar that the heavens were opened and i saw visions of god in the fifth day of the month which was the fifth year of king jehoiachin s captivity the word of the lord came expressly unto ezekiel the priest the son of buzi in the land of the chaldeans by the river chebar and the hand of the lord was there upon him and i looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the north a great cloud and a fire infolding itself and a brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber out of the midst of the fire also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man and every one had four faces and every one had four wings and their feet were straight feet and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf s foot and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass and they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides and they four had their faces and their wings their wings were joined one to another they turned not when they went they went every one straight forward as for the likeness of their faces they four had the face of a man and the face of a lion on the right side and they four had the face of an ox on the left side they four also had the face of an eagle thus were their faces and their wings were stretched upward two wings of every one were joined one to another and two covered their bodies and they went every one straight forward whither the spirit was to go they went and they turned not when they went as for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance was like burning coals of fire and like the appearance of lamps it went up and down among the living creatures and the fire was bright and out of the fire went forth lightning and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning now as i beheld the living creatures behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures with his four faces the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl and they four had one likeness and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel when they went they went upon their four sides and they turned not when they went as for their rings they were so high that they were dreadful and their rings were full of eyes round about them four and when the living creatures went the wheels went by them and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up whithersoever the spirit was to go they went thither was their spirit to go and the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels when those went these went and when those stood these stood and when those were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels and the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal stretched forth over their heads above and under the firmament were their wings straight the one toward the other every one had two which covered on this side and every one had two which covered on that side their bodies and when they went i heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters as the voice of the almighty the voice of speech as the noise of an host when they stood they let down their wings and there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads when they stood and had let down their wings and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it and i saw as the colour of amber as the appearance of fire round about within it from the appearance of his loins even upward and from the appearance of his loins even downward i saw as it were the appearance of fire and it had brightness round about as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain so was the appearance of the brightness round about this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the lord and when i saw it i fell upon my face and i heard a voice of one that spake and he said unto me son of man stand upon thy feet and i will speak unto thee and the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me and set me upon my feet that i heard him that spake unto me and he said unto me son of man i send thee to the children of israel to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day for they are impudent children and stiffhearted i do send thee unto them and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord god and they whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are a rebellious house yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them and thou son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of their words though briers and thorns be with thee and thou dost dwell among scorpions be not afraid of their words nor be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious house and thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are most rebellious but thou son of man hear what i say unto thee be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat that i give thee and when i looked behold an hand was sent unto me and lo a roll of a book was therein and he spread it before me and it was written within and without and there was written therein lamentations and mourning and woe moreover he said unto me son of man eat that thou findest eat this roll and go speak unto the house of israel so i opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that roll and he said unto me son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill thy bowels with this roll that i give thee then did i eat it and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness and he said unto me son of man go get thee unto the house of israel and speak with my words unto them for thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language but to the house of israel not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language whose words thou canst not understand surely had i sent thee to them they would have hearkened unto thee but the house of israel will not hearken unto thee for they will not hearken unto me for all the house of israel are impudent and hardhearted behold i have made thy face strong against their faces and thy forehead strong against their foreheads as an adamant harder than flint have i made thy forehead fear them not neither be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious house moreover he said unto me son of man all my words that i shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart and hear with thine ears and go get thee to them of the captivity unto the children of thy people and speak unto them and tell them thus saith the lord god whether they will hear or whether they will forbear then the spirit took me up and i heard behind me a voice of a great rushing saying blessed be the glory of the lord from his place i heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another and the noise of the wheels over against them and a noise of a great rushing so the spirit lifted me up and took me away and i went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit but the hand of the lord was strong upon me then i came to them of the captivity at telabib that dwelt by the river of chebar and i sat where they sat and remained there astonished among them seven days and it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man i have made thee a watchman unto the house of israel therefore hear the word at my mouth and give them warning from me when i say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die and thou givest him not warning nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will i require at thine hand yet if thou warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickedness nor from his wicked way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soul again when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness and commit iniquity and i lay a stumbling block before him he shall die because thou hast not given him warning he shall die in his sin and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered but his blood will i require at thine hand nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man that the righteous sin not and he doth not sin he shall surely live because he is warned also thou hast delivered thy soul and the hand of the lord was there upon me and he said unto me arise go forth into the plain and i will there talk with thee then i arose and went forth into the plain and behold the glory of the lord stood there as the glory which i saw by the river of chebar and i fell on my face then the spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet and spake with me and said unto me go shut thyself within thine house but thou o son of man behold they shall put bands upon thee and shall bind thee with them and thou shalt not go out among them and i will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth that thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be to them a reprover for they are a rebellious house but when i speak with thee i will open thy mouth and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord god he that heareth let him hear and he that forbeareth let him forbear for they are a rebellious house thou also son of man take thee a tile and lay it before thee and pourtray upon it the city even jerusalem and lay siege against it and build a fort against it and cast a mount against it set the camp also against it and set battering rams against it round about moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city and set thy face against it and it shall be besieged and thou shalt lay siege against it this shall be a sign to the house of israel lie thou also upon thy left side and lay the iniquity of the house of israel upon it according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity for i have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity according to the number of the days three hundred and ninety days so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of israel and when thou hast accomplished them lie again on thy right side and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of judah forty days i have appointed thee each day for a year therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of jerusalem and thine arm shall be uncovered and thou shalt prophesy against it and behold i will lay bands upon thee and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another till thou hast ended the days of thy siege take thou also unto thee wheat and barley and beans and lentiles and millet and fitches and put them in one vessel and make thee bread thereof according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof and thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight twenty shekels a day from time to time shalt thou eat it thou shalt drink also water by measure the sixth part of an hin from time to time shalt thou drink and thou shalt eat it as barley cakes and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man in their sight and the lord said even thus shall the children of israel eat their defiled bread among the gentiles whither i will drive them then said i ah lord god behold my soul hath not been polluted for from my youth up even till now have i not eaten of that which dieth of itself or is torn in pieces neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth then he said unto me lo i have given thee cow s dung for man s dung and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith moreover he said unto me son of man behold i will break the staff of bread in jerusalem and they shall eat bread by weight and with care and they shall drink water by measure and with astonishment that they may want bread and water and be astonied one with another and consume away for their iniquity and thou son of man take thee a sharp knife take thee a barber s razor and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard then take thee balances to weigh and divide the hair thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city when the days of the siege are fulfilled and thou shalt take a third part and smite about it with a knife and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind and i will draw out a sword after them thou shalt also take thereof a few in number and bind them in thy skirts then take of them again and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of israel thus saith the lord god this is jerusalem i have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her and she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her for they have refused my judgments and my statutes they have not walked in them therefore thus saith the lord god because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you and have not walked in my statutes neither have kept my judgments neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you therefore thus saith the lord god behold i even i am against thee and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations and i will do in thee that which i have not done and whereunto i will not do any more the like because of all thine abominations therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee and the sons shall eat their fathers and i will execute judgments in thee and the whole remnant of thee will i scatter into all the winds wherefore as i live saith the lord god surely because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things and with all thine abominations therefore will i also diminish thee neither shall mine eye spare neither will i have any pity a third part of thee shall die with the pestilence and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee and i will scatter a third part into all the winds and i will draw out a sword after them thus shall mine anger be accomplished and i will cause my fury to rest upon them and i will be comforted and they shall know that i the lord have spoken it in my zeal when i have accomplished my fury in them moreover i will make thee waste and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee in the sight of all that pass by so it shall be a reproach and a taunt an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee when i shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes i the lord have spoken it when i shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine which shall be for their destruction and which i will send to destroy you and i will increase the famine upon you and will break your staff of bread so will i send upon you famine and evil beasts and they shall bereave thee and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee and i will bring the sword upon thee i the lord have spoken it and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man set thy face toward the mountains of israel and prophesy against them and say ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord god thus saith the lord god to the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys behold i even i will bring a sword upon you and i will destroy your high places and your altars shall be desolate and your images shall be broken and i will cast down your slain men before your idols and i will lay the dead carcases of the children of israel before their idols and i will scatter your bones round about your altars in all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste and the high places shall be desolate that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate and your idols may be broken and cease and your images may be cut down and your works may be abolished and the slain shall fall in the midst of you and ye shall know that i am the lord yet will i leave a remnant that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations when ye shall be scattered through the countries and they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives because i am broken with their whorish heart which hath departed from me and with their eyes which go a whoring after their idols and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations and they shall know that i am the lord and that i have not said in vain that i would do this evil unto them thus saith the lord god smite with thine hand and stamp with thy foot and say alas for all the evil abominations of the house of israel for they shall fall by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence he that is far off shall die of the pestilence and he that is near shall fall by the sword and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine thus will i accomplish my fury upon them then shall ye know that i am the lord when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars upon every high hill in all the tops of the mountains and under every green tree and under every thick oak the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols so will i stretch out my hand upon them and make the land desolate yea more desolate than the wilderness toward diblath in all their habitations and they shall know that i am the lord moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying also thou son of man thus saith the lord god unto the land of israel an end the end is come upon the four corners of the land now is the end come upon thee and i will send mine anger upon thee and will judge thee according to thy ways and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations and mine eye shall not spare thee neither will i have pity but i will recompense thy ways upon thee and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee and ye shall know that i am the lord thus saith the lord god an evil an only evil behold is come an end is come the end is come it watcheth for thee behold it is come the morning is come unto thee o thou that dwellest in the land the time is come the day of trouble is near and not the sounding again of the mountains now will i shortly pour out my fury upon thee and accomplish mine anger upon thee and i will judge thee according to thy ways and will recompense thee for all thine abominations and mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity i will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee and ye shall know that i am the lord that smiteth behold the day behold it is come the morning is gone forth the rod hath blossomed pride hath budded violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness none of them shall remain nor of their multitude nor of any of theirs neither shall there be wailing for them the time is come the day draweth near let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller mourn for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof for the seller shall not return to that which is sold although they were yet alive for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof which shall not return neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life they have blown the trumpet even to make all ready but none goeth to the battle for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof the sword is without and the pestilence and the famine within he that is in the field shall die with the sword and he that is in the city famine and pestilence shall devour him but they that escape of them shall escape and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys all of them mourning every one for his iniquity all hands shall be feeble and all knees shall be weak as water they shall also gird themselves with sackcloth and horror shall cover them and shame shall be upon all faces and baldness upon all their heads they shall cast their silver in the streets and their gold shall be removed their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the lord they shall not satisfy their souls neither fill their bowels because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity as for the beauty of his ornament he set it in majesty but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein therefore have i set it far from them and i will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil and they shall pollute it my face will i turn also from them and they shall pollute my secret place for the robbers shall enter into it and defile it make a chain for the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence wherefore i will bring the worst of the heathen and they shall possess their houses i will also make the pomp of the strong to cease and their holy places shall be defiled destruction cometh and they shall seek peace and there shall be none mischief shall come upon mischief and rumour shall be upon rumour then shall they seek a vision of the prophet but the law shall perish from the priest and counsel from the ancients the king shall mourn and the prince shall be clothed with desolation and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled i will do unto them after their way and according to their deserts will i judge them and they shall know that i am the lord and it came to pass in the sixth year in the sixth month in the fifth day of the month as i sat in mine house and the elders of judah sat before me that the hand of the lord god fell there upon me then i beheld and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire from the appearance of his loins even downward fire and from his loins even upward as the appearance of brightness as the colour of amber and he put forth the form of an hand and took me by a lock of mine head and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven and brought me in the visions of god to jerusalem to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north where was the seat of the image of jealousy which provoketh to jealousy and behold the glory of the god of israel was there according to the vision that i saw in the plain then said he unto me son of man lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north so i lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry he said furthermore unto me son of man seest thou what they do even the great abominations that the house of israel committeth here that i should go far off from my sanctuary but turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations and he brought me to the door of the court and when i looked behold a hole in the wall then said he unto me son of man dig now in the wall and when i had digged in the wall behold a door and he said unto me go in and behold the wicked abominations that they do here so i went in and saw and behold every form of creeping things and abominable beasts and all the idols of the house of israel pourtrayed upon the wall round about and there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of israel and in the midst of them stood jaazaniah the son of shaphan with every man his censer in his hand and a thick cloud of incense went up then said he unto me son of man hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of israel do in the dark every man in the chambers of his imagery for they say the lord seeth us not the lord hath forsaken the earth he said also unto me turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do then he brought me to the door of the gate of the lord s house which was toward the north and behold there sat women weeping for tammuz then said he unto me hast thou seen this o son of man turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations than these and he brought me into the inner court of the lord s house and behold at the door of the temple of the lord between the porch and the altar were about five and twenty men with their backs toward the temple of the lord and their faces toward the east and they worshipped the sun toward the east then he said unto me hast thou seen this o son of man is it a light thing to the house of judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here for they have filled the land with violence and have returned to provoke me to anger and lo they put the branch to their nose therefore will i also deal in fury mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice yet will i not hear them he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying cause them that have charge over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lieth toward the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writer s inkhorn by his side and they went in and stood beside the brasen altar and the glory of the god of israel was gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writer s inkhorn by his side and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in mine hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eye spare neither have ye pity slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house and he said unto them defile the house and fill the courts with the slain go ye forth and they went forth and slew in the city and it came to pass while they were slaying them and i was left that i fell upon my face and cried and said ah lord god wilt thou destroy all the residue of israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon jerusalem then said he unto me the iniquity of the house of israel and judah is exceeding great and the land is full of blood and the city full of perverseness for they say the lord hath forsaken the earth and the lord seeth not and as for me also mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity but i will recompense their way upon their head and behold the man clothed with linen which had the inkhorn by his side reported the matter saying i have done as thou hast commanded me then i looked and behold in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone as the appearance of the likeness of a throne and he spake unto the man clothed with linen and said go in between the wheels even under the cherub and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims and scatter them over the city and he went in in my sight now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house when the man went in and the cloud filled the inner court then the glory of the lord went up from the cherub and stood over the threshold of the house and the house was filled with the cloud and the court was full of the brightness of the lord s glory and the sound of the cherubims wings was heard even to the outer court as the voice of the almighty god when he speaketh and it came to pass that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen saying take fire from between the wheels from between the cherubims then he went in and stood beside the wheels and one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims and took thereof and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen who took it and went out and there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man s hand under their wings and when i looked behold the four wheels by the cherubims one wheel by one cherub and another wheel by another cherub and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone and as for their appearances they four had one likeness as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel when they went they went upon their four sides they turned not as they went but to the place whither the head looked they followed it they turned not as they went and their whole body and their backs and their hands and their wings and the wheels were full of eyes round about even the wheels that they four had as for the wheels it was cried unto them in my hearing o wheel and every one had four faces the first face was the face of a cherub and the second face was the face of a man and the third the face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle and the cherubims were lifted up this is the living creature that i saw by the river of chebar and when the cherubims went the wheels went by them and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth the same wheels also turned not from beside them when they stood these stood and when they were lifted up these lifted up themselves also for the spirit of the living creature was in them then the glory of the lord departed from off the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubims and the cherubims lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went out the wheels also were beside them and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the lord s house and the glory of the god of israel was over them above this is the living creature that i saw under the god of israel by the river of chebar and i knew that they were the cherubims every one had four faces apiece and every one four wings and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings and the likeness of their faces was the same faces which i saw by the river of chebar their appearances and themselves they went every one straight forward moreover the spirit lifted me up and brought me unto the east gate of the lord s house which looketh eastward and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men among whom i saw jaazaniah the son of azur and pelatiah the son of benaiah princes of the people then said he unto me son of man these are the men that devise mischief and give wicked counsel in this city which say it is not near let us build houses this city is the caldron and we be the flesh therefore prophesy against them prophesy o son of man and the spirit of the lord fell upon me and said unto me speak thus saith the lord thus have ye said o house of israel for i know the things that come into your mind every one of them ye have multiplied your slain in this city and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain therefore thus saith the lord god your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it they are the flesh and this city is the caldron but i will bring you forth out of the midst of it ye have feared the sword and i will bring a sword upon you saith the lord god and i will bring you out of the midst thereof and deliver you into the hands of strangers and will execute judgments among you ye shall fall by the sword i will judge you in the border of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord this city shall not be your caldron neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof but i will judge you in the border of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord for ye have not walked in my statutes neither executed my judgments but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you and it came to pass when i prophesied that pelatiah the son of benaiah died then fell i down upon my face and cried with a loud voice and said ah lord god wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of israel again the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man thy brethren even thy brethren the men of thy kindred and all the house of israel wholly are they unto whom the inhabitants of jerusalem have said get you far from the lord unto us is this land given in possession therefore say thus saith the lord god although i have cast them far off among the heathen and although i have scattered them among the countries yet will i be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come therefore say thus saith the lord god i will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered and i will give you the land of israel and they shall come thither and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence and i will give them one heart and i will put a new spirit within you and i will take the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them an heart of flesh that they may walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances and do them and they shall be my people and i will be their god but as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations i will recompense their way upon their own heads saith the lord god then did the cherubims lift up their wings and the wheels beside them and the glory of the god of israel was over them above and the glory of the lord went up from the midst of the city and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city afterwards the spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the spirit of god into chaldea to them of the captivity so the vision that i had seen went up from me then i spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the lord had shewed me the word of the lord also came unto me saying son of man thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house which have eyes to see and see not they have ears to hear and hear not for they are a rebellious house therefore thou son of man prepare thee stuff for removing and remove by day in their sight and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight it may be they will consider though they be a rebellious house then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight as stuff for removing and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight as they that go forth into captivity dig thou through the wall in their sight and carry out thereby in their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders and carry it forth in the twilight thou shalt cover thy face that thou see not the ground for i have set thee for a sign unto the house of israel and i did so as i was commanded i brought forth my stuff by day as stuff for captivity and in the even i digged through the wall with mine hand i brought it forth in the twilight and i bare it upon my shoulder in their sight and in the morning came the word of the lord unto me saying son of man hath not the house of israel the rebellious house said unto thee what doest thou say thou unto them thus saith the lord god this burden concerneth the prince in jerusalem and all the house of israel that are among them say i am your sign like as i have done so shall it be done unto them they shall remove and go into captivity and the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight and shall go forth they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby he shall cover his face that he see not the ground with his eyes my net also will i spread upon him and he shall be taken in my snare and i will bring him to babylon to the land of the chaldeans yet shall he not see it though he shall die there and i will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him and all his bands and i will draw out the sword after them and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall scatter them among the nations and disperse them in the countries but i will leave a few men of them from the sword from the famine and from the pestilence that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come and they shall know that i am the lord moreover the word of the lord came to me saying son of man eat thy bread with quaking and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness and say unto the people of the land thus saith the lord god of the inhabitants of jerusalem and of the land of israel they shall eat their bread with carefulness and drink their water with astonishment that her land may be desolate from all that is therein because of the violence of all them that dwell therein and the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste and the land shall be desolate and ye shall know that i am the lord and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man what is that proverb that ye have in the land of israel saying the days are prolonged and every vision faileth tell them therefore thus saith the lord god i will make this proverb to cease and they shall no more use it as a proverb in israel but say unto them the days are at hand and the effect of every vision for there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of israel for i am the lord i will speak and the word that i shall speak shall come to pass it shall be no more prolonged for in your days o rebellious house will i say the word and will perform it saith the lord god again the word of the lord came to me saying son of man behold they of the house of israel say the vision that he seeth is for many days to come and he prophesieth of the times that are far off therefore say unto them thus saith the lord god there shall none of my words be prolonged any more but the word which i have spoken shall be done saith the lord god and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man prophesy against the prophets of israel that prophesy and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts hear ye the word of the lord thus saith the lord god woe unto the foolish prophets that follow their own spirit and have seen nothing o israel thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts ye have not gone up into the gaps neither made up the hedge for the house of israel to stand in the battle in the day of the lord they have seen vanity and lying divination saying the lord saith and the lord hath not sent them and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word have ye not seen a vain vision and have ye not spoken a lying divination whereas ye say the lord saith it albeit i have not spoken therefore thus saith the lord god because ye have spoken vanity and seen lies therefore behold i am against you saith the lord god and mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity and that divine lies they shall not be in the assembly of my people neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of israel neither shall they enter into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord god because even because they have seduced my people saying peace and there was no peace and one built up a wall and lo others daubed it with untempered morter say unto them which daub it with untempered morter that it shall fall there shall be an overflowing shower and ye o great hailstones shall fall and a stormy wind shall rend it lo when the wall is fallen shall it not be said unto you where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it therefore thus saith the lord god i will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger and great hailstones in my fury to consume it so will i break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter and bring it down to the ground so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered and it shall fall and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof and ye shall know that i am the lord thus will i accomplish my wrath upon the wall and upon them that have daubed it with untempered morter and will say unto you the wall is no more neither they that daubed it to wit the prophets of israel which prophesy concerning jerusalem and which see visions of peace for her and there is no peace saith the lord god likewise thou son of man set thy face against the daughters of thy people which prophesy out of their own heart and prophesy thou against them and say thus saith the lord god woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls will ye hunt the souls of my people and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you and will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread to slay the souls that should not die and to save the souls alive that should not live by your lying to my people that hear your lies wherefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against your pillows wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly and i will tear them from your arms and will let the souls go even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly your kerchiefs also will i tear and deliver my people out of your hand and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted and ye shall know that i am the lord because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad whom i have not made sad and strengthened the hands of the wicked that he should not return from his wicked way by promising him life therefore ye shall see no more vanity nor divine divinations for i will deliver my people out of your hand and ye shall know that i am the lord then came certain of the elders of israel unto me and sat before me and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man these men have set up their idols in their heart and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face should i be enquired of at all by them therefore speak unto them and say unto them thus saith the lord god every man of the house of israel that setteth up his idols in his heart and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and cometh to the prophet i the lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols that i may take the house of israel in their own heart because they are all estranged from me through their idols therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god repent and turn yourselves from your idols and turn away your faces from all your abominations for every one of the house of israel or of the stranger that sojourneth in israel which separateth himself from me and setteth up his idols in his heart and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me i the lord will answer him by myself and i will set my face against that man and will make him a sign and a proverb and i will cut him off from the midst of my people and ye shall know that i am the lord and if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing i the lord have deceived that prophet and i will stretch out my hand upon him and will destroy him from the midst of my people israel and they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him that the house of israel may go no more astray from me neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions but that they may be my people and i may be their god saith the lord god the word of the lord came again to me saying son of man when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously then will i stretch out mine hand upon it and will break the staff of the bread thereof and will send famine upon it and will cut off man and beast from it though these three men noah daniel and job were in it they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness saith the lord god if i cause noisome beasts to pass through the land and they spoil it so that it be desolate that no man may pass through because of the beasts though these three men were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters they only shall be delivered but the land shall be desolate or if i bring a sword upon that land and say sword go through the land so that i cut off man and beast from it though these three men were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters but they only shall be delivered themselves or if i send a pestilence into that land and pour out my fury upon it in blood to cut off from it man and beast though noah daniel and job were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither son nor daughter they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness for thus saith the lord god how much more when i send my four sore judgments upon jerusalem the sword and the famine and the noisome beast and the pestilence to cut off from it man and beast yet behold therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth both sons and daughters behold they shall come forth unto you and ye shall see their way and their doings and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem even concerning all that i have brought upon it and they shall comfort you when ye see their ways and their doings and ye shall know that i have not done without cause all that i have done in it saith the lord god and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man what is the vine tree more than any tree or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest shall wood be taken thereof to do any work or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon behold it is cast into the fire for fuel the fire devoureth both the ends of it and the midst of it is burned is it meet for any work behold when it was whole it was meet for no work how much less shall it be meet yet for any work when the fire hath devoured it and it is burned therefore thus saith the lord god as the vine tree among the trees of the forest which i have given to the fire for fuel so will i give the inhabitants of jerusalem and i will set my face against them they shall go out from one fire and another fire shall devour them and ye shall know that i am the lord when i set my face against them and i will make the land desolate because they have committed a trespass saith the lord god again the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man cause jerusalem to know her abominations and say thus saith the lord god unto jerusalem thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of canaan thy father was an amorite and thy mother an hittite and as for thy nativity in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee thou wast not salted at all nor swaddled at all none eye pitied thee to do any of these unto thee to have compassion upon thee but thou wast cast out in the open field to the lothing of thy person in the day that thou wast born and when i passed by thee and saw thee polluted in thine own blood i said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood live yea i said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood live i have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field and thou hast increased and waxen great and thou art come to excellent ornaments thy breasts are fashioned and thine hair is grown whereas thou wast naked and bare now when i passed by thee and looked upon thee behold thy time was the time of love and i spread my skirt over thee and covered thy nakedness yea i sware unto thee and entered into a covenant with thee saith the lord god and thou becamest mine then washed i thee with water yea i throughly washed away thy blood from thee and i anointed thee with oil i clothed thee also with broidered work and shod thee with badgers skin and i girded thee about with fine linen and i covered thee with silk i decked thee also with ornaments and i put bracelets upon thy hands and a chain on thy neck and i put a jewel on thy forehead and earrings in thine ears and a beautiful crown upon thine head thus wast thou decked with gold and silver and thy raiment was of fine linen and silk and broidered work thou didst eat fine flour and honey and oil and thou wast exceeding beautiful and thou didst prosper into a kingdom and thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty for it was perfect through my comeliness which i had put upon thee saith the lord god but thou didst trust in thine own beauty and playedst the harlot because of thy renown and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by his it was and of thy garments thou didst take and deckedst thy high places with divers colours and playedst the harlot thereupon the like things shall not come neither shall it be so thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver which i had given thee and madest to thyself images of men and didst commit whoredom with them and tookest thy broidered garments and coveredst them and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them my meat also which i gave thee fine flour and oil and honey wherewith i fed thee thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour and thus it was saith the lord god moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters whom thou hast borne unto me and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured is this of thy whoredoms a small matter that thou hast slain my children and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them and in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth when thou wast naked and bare and wast polluted in thy blood and it came to pass after all thy wickedness woe woe unto thee saith the lord god that thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place and hast made thee an high place in every street thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by and multiplied thy whoredoms thou hast also committed fornication with the egyptians thy neighbours great of flesh and hast increased thy whoredoms to provoke me to anger behold therefore i have stretched out my hand over thee and have diminished thine ordinary food and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee the daughters of the philistines which are ashamed of thy lewd way thou hast played the whore also with the assyrians because thou wast unsatiable yea thou hast played the harlot with them and yet couldest not be satisfied thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of canaan unto chaldea and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith how weak is thine heart saith the lord god seeing thou doest all these things the work of an imperious whorish woman in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way and makest thine high place in every street and hast not been as an harlot in that thou scornest hire but as a wife that committeth adultery which taketh strangers instead of her husband they give gifts to all whores but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers and hirest them that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom and the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms and in that thou givest a reward and no reward is given unto thee therefore thou art contrary wherefore o harlot hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god because thy filthiness was poured out and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers and with all the idols of thy abominations and by the blood of thy children which thou didst give unto them behold therefore i will gather all thy lovers with whom thou hast taken pleasure and all them that thou hast loved with all them that thou hast hated i will even gather them round about against thee and will discover thy nakedness unto them that they may see all thy nakedness and i will judge thee as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged and i will give thee blood in fury and jealousy and i will also give thee into their hand and they shall throw down thine eminent place and shall break down thy high places they shall strip thee also of thy clothes and shall take thy fair jewels and leave thee naked and bare they shall also bring up a company against thee and they shall stone thee with stones and thrust thee through with their swords and they shall burn thine houses with fire and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women and i will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot and thou also shalt give no hire any more so will i make my fury toward thee to rest and my jealousy shall depart from thee and i will be quiet and will be no more angry because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth but hast fretted me in all these things behold therefore i also will recompense thy way upon thine head saith the lord god and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations behold every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee saying as is the mother so is her daughter thou art thy mother s daughter that lotheth her husband and her children and thou art the sister of thy sisters which lothed their husbands and their children your mother was an hittite and your father an amorite and thine elder sister is samaria she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy right hand is sodom and her daughters yet hast thou not walked after their ways nor done after their abominations but as if that were a very little thing thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways as i live saith the lord god sodom thy sister hath not done she nor her daughters as thou hast done thou and thy daughters behold this was the iniquity of thy sister sodom pride fulness of bread and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy and they were haughty and committed abomination before me therefore i took them away as i saw good neither hath samaria committed half of thy sins but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done thou also which hast judged thy sisters bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they they are more righteous than thou yea be thou confounded also and bear thy shame in that thou hast justified thy sisters when i shall bring again their captivity the captivity of sodom and her daughters and the captivity of samaria and her daughters then will i bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them that thou mayest bear thine own shame and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done in that thou art a comfort unto them when thy sisters sodom and her daughters shall return to their former estate and samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate for thy sister sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride before thy wickedness was discovered as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of syria and all that are round about her the daughters of the philistines which despise thee round about thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations saith the lord for thus saith the lord god i will even deal with thee as thou hast done which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant nevertheless i will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth and i will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant then thou shalt remember thy ways and be ashamed when thou shalt receive thy sisters thine elder and thy younger and i will give them unto thee for daughters but not by thy covenant and i will establish my covenant with thee and thou shalt know that i am the lord that thou mayest remember and be confounded and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame when i am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done saith the lord god and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man put forth a riddle and speak a parable unto the house of israel and say thus saith the lord god a great eagle with great wings longwinged full of feathers which had divers colours came unto lebanon and took the highest branch of the cedar he cropped off the top of his young twigs and carried it into a land of traffick he set it in a city of merchants he took also of the seed of the land and planted it in a fruitful field he placed it by great waters and set it as a willow tree and it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature whose branches turned toward him and the roots thereof were under him so it became a vine and brought forth branches and shot forth sprigs there was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers and behold this vine did bend her roots toward him and shot forth her branches toward him that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation it was planted in a good soil by great waters that it might bring forth branches and that it might bear fruit that it might be a goodly vine say thou thus saith the lord god shall it prosper shall he not pull up the roots thereof and cut off the fruit thereof that it wither it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof yea behold being planted shall it prosper shall it not utterly wither when the east wind toucheth it it shall wither in the furrows where it grew moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying say now to the rebellious house know ye not what these things mean tell them behold the king of babylon is come to jerusalem and hath taken the king thereof and the princes thereof and led them with him to babylon and hath taken of the king s seed and made a covenant with him and hath taken an oath of him he hath also taken the mighty of the land that the kingdom might be base that it might not lift itself up but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand but he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into egypt that they might give him horses and much people shall he prosper shall he escape that doeth such things or shall he break the covenant and be delivered as i live saith the lord god surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king whose oath he despised and whose covenant he brake even with him in the midst of babylon he shall die neither shall pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war by casting up mounts and building forts to cut off many persons seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant when lo he had given his hand and hath done all these things he shall not escape therefore thus saith the lord god as i live surely mine oath that he hath despised and my covenant that he hath broken even it will i recompense upon his own head and i will spread my net upon him and he shall be taken in my snare and i will bring him to babylon and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me and all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds and ye shall know that i the lord have spoken it thus saith the lord god i will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar and will set it i will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent in the mountain of the height of israel will i plant it and it shall bring forth boughs and bear fruit and be a goodly cedar and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell and all the trees of the field shall know that i the lord have brought down the high tree have exalted the low tree have dried up the green tree and have made the dry tree to flourish i the lord have spoken and have done it the word of the lord came unto me again saying what mean ye that ye use this proverb concerning the land of israel saying the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children s teeth are set on edge as i live saith the lord god ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in israel behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die but if a man be just and do that which is lawful and right and hath not eaten upon the mountains neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of israel neither hath defiled his neighbour s wife neither hath come near to a menstruous woman and hath not oppressed any but hath restored to the debtor his pledge hath spoiled none by violence hath given his bread to the hungry and hath covered the naked with a garment he that hath not given forth upon usury neither hath taken any increase that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity hath executed true judgment between man and man hath walked in my statutes and hath kept my judgments to deal truly he is just he shall surely live saith the lord god if he beget a son that is a robber a shedder of blood and that doeth the like to any one of these things and that doeth not any of those duties but even hath eaten upon the mountains and defiled his neighbour s wife hath oppressed the poor and needy hath spoiled by violence hath not restored the pledge and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols hath committed abomination hath given forth upon usury and hath taken increase shall he then live he shall not live he hath done all these abominations he shall surely die his blood shall be upon him now lo if he beget a son that seeth all his father s sins which he hath done and considereth and doeth not such like that hath not eaten upon the mountains neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of israel hath not defiled his neighbour s wife neither hath oppressed any hath not withholden the pledge neither hath spoiled by violence but hath given his bread to the hungry and hath covered the naked with a garment that hath taken off his hand from the poor that hath not received usury nor increase hath executed my judgments hath walked in my statutes he shall not die for the iniquity of his father he shall surely live as for his father because he cruelly oppressed spoiled his brother by violence and did that which is not good among his people lo even he shall die in his iniquity yet say ye why doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father when the son hath done that which is lawful and right and hath kept all my statutes and hath done them he shall surely live the soul that sinneth it shall die the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed and keep all my statutes and do that which is lawful and right he shall surely live he shall not die all his transgressions that he hath committed they shall not be mentioned unto him in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live have i any pleasure at all that the wicked should die saith the lord god and not that he should return from his ways and live but when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth shall he live all his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned in his trespass that he hath trespassed and in his sin that he hath sinned in them shall he die yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal hear now o house of israel is not my way equal are not your ways unequal when a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and dieth in them for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die again when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall save his soul alive because he considereth and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed he shall surely live he shall not die yet saith the house of israel the way of the lord is not equal o house of israel are not my ways equal are not your ways unequal therefore i will judge you o house of israel every one according to his ways saith the lord god repent and turn yourselves from all your transgressions so iniquity shall not be your ruin cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will ye die o house of israel for i have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth saith the lord god wherefore turn yourselves and live ye moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of israel and say what is thy mother a lioness she lay down among lions she nourished her whelps among young lions and she brought up one of her whelps it became a young lion and it learned to catch the prey it devoured men the nations also heard of him he was taken in their pit and they brought him with chains unto the land of egypt now when she saw that she had waited and her hope was lost then she took another of her whelps and made him a young lion and he went up and down among the lions he became a young lion and learned to catch the prey and devoured men and he knew their desolate palaces and he laid waste their cities and the land was desolate and the fulness thereof by the noise of his roaring then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces and spread their net over him he was taken in their pit and they put him in ward in chains and brought him to the king of babylon they brought him into holds that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of israel thy mother is like a vine in thy blood planted by the waters she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters and she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule and her stature was exalted among the thick branches and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches but she was plucked up in fury she was cast down to the ground and the east wind dried up her fruit her strong rods were broken and withered the fire consumed them and now she is planted in the wilderness in a dry and thirsty ground and fire is gone out of a rod of her branches which hath devoured her fruit so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule this is a lamentation and shall be for a lamentation and it came to pass in the seventh year in the fifth month the tenth day of the month that certain of the elders of israel came to enquire of the lord and sat before me then came the word of the lord unto me saying son of man speak unto the elders of israel and say unto them thus saith the lord god are ye come to enquire of me as i live saith the lord god i will not be enquired of by you wilt thou judge them son of man wilt thou judge them cause them to know the abominations of their fathers and say unto them thus saith the lord god in the day when i chose israel and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of jacob and made myself known unto them in the land of egypt when i lifted up mine hand unto them saying i am the lord your god in the day that i lifted up mine hand unto them to bring them forth of the land of egypt into a land that i had espied for them flowing with milk and honey which is the glory of all lands then said i unto them cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes and defile not yourselves with the idols of egypt i am the lord your god but they rebelled against me and would not hearken unto me they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes neither did they forsake the idols of egypt then i said i will pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of egypt but i wrought for my name s sake that it should not be polluted before the heathen among whom they were in whose sight i made myself known unto them in bringing them forth out of the land of egypt wherefore i caused them to go forth out of the land of egypt and brought them into the wilderness and i gave them my statutes and shewed them my judgments which if a man do he shall even live in them moreover also i gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them that they might know that i am the lord that sanctify them but the house of israel rebelled against me in the wilderness they walked not in my statutes and they despised my judgments which if a man do he shall even live in them and my sabbaths they greatly polluted then i said i would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness to consume them but i wrought for my name s sake that it should not be polluted before the heathen in whose sight i brought them out yet also i lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness that i would not bring them into the land which i had given them flowing with milk and honey which is the glory of all lands because they despised my judgments and walked not in my statutes but polluted my sabbaths for their heart went after their idols nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them neither did i make an end of them in the wilderness but i said unto their children in the wilderness walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers neither observe their judgments nor defile yourselves with their idols i am the lord your god walk in my statutes and keep my judgments and do them and hallow my sabbaths and they shall be a sign between me and you that ye may know that i am the lord your god notwithstanding the children rebelled against me they walked not in my statutes neither kept my judgments to do them which if a man do he shall even live in them they polluted my sabbaths then i said i would pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness nevertheless i withdrew mine hand and wrought for my name s sake that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen in whose sight i brought them forth i lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness that i would scatter them among the heathen and disperse them through the countries because they had not executed my judgments but had despised my statutes and had polluted my sabbaths and their eyes were after their fathers idols wherefore i gave them also statutes that were not good and judgments whereby they should not live and i polluted them in their own gifts in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb that i might make them desolate to the end that they might know that i am the lord therefore son of man speak unto the house of israel and say unto them thus saith the lord god yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me in that they have committed a trespass against me for when i had brought them into the land for the which i lifted up mine hand to give it to them then they saw every high hill and all the thick trees and they offered there their sacrifices and there they presented the provocation of their offering there also they made their sweet savour and poured out there their drink offerings then i said unto them what is the high place whereunto ye go and the name thereof is called bamah unto this day wherefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers and commit ye whoredom after their abominations for when ye offer your gifts when ye make your sons to pass through the fire ye pollute yourselves with all your idols even unto this day and shall i be enquired of by you o house of israel as i live saith the lord god i will not be enquired of by you and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all that ye say we will be as the heathen as the families of the countries to serve wood and stone as i live saith the lord god surely with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out will i rule over you and i will bring you out from the people and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out and i will bring you into the wilderness of the people and there will i plead with you face to face like as i pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of egypt so will i plead with you saith the lord god and i will cause you to pass under the rod and i will bring you into the bond of the covenant and i will purge out from among you the rebels and them that transgress against me i will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn and they shall not enter into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord as for you o house of israel thus saith the lord god go ye serve ye every one his idols and hereafter also if ye will not hearken unto me but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts and with your idols for in mine holy mountain in the mountain of the height of israel saith the lord god there shall all the house of israel all of them in the land serve me there will i accept them and there will i require your offerings and the firstfruits of your oblations with all your holy things i will accept you with your sweet savour when i bring you out from the people and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered and i will be sanctified in you before the heathen and ye shall know that i am the lord when i shall bring you into the land of israel into the country for the which i lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers and there shall ye remember your ways and all your doings wherein ye have been defiled and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have wrought with you for my name s sake not according to your wicked ways nor according to your corrupt doings o ye house of israel saith the lord god moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man set thy face toward the south and drop thy word toward the south and prophesy against the forest of the south field and say to the forest of the south hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god behold i will kindle a fire in thee and it shall devour every green tree in thee and every dry tree the flaming flame shall not be quenched and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein and all flesh shall see that i the lord have kindled it it shall not be quenched then said i ah lord god they say of me doth he not speak parables and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man set thy face toward jerusalem and drop thy word toward the holy places and prophesy against the land of israel and say to the land of israel thus saith the lord behold i am against thee and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked seeing then that i will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north that all flesh may know that i the lord have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath it shall not return any more sigh therefore thou son of man with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness sigh before their eyes and it shall be when they say unto thee wherefore sighest thou that thou shalt answer for the tidings because it cometh and every heart shall melt and all hands shall be feeble and every spirit shall faint and all knees shall be weak as water behold it cometh and shall be brought to pass saith the lord god again the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord say a sword a sword is sharpened and also furbished it is sharpened to make a sore slaughter it is furbished that it may glitter should we then make mirth it contemneth the rod of my son as every tree and he hath given it to be furbished that it may be handled this sword is sharpened and it is furbished to give it into the hand of the slayer cry and howl son of man for it shall be upon my people it shall be upon all the princes of israel terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people smite therefore upon thy thigh because it is a trial and what if the sword contemn even the rod it shall be no more saith the lord god thou therefore son of man prophesy and smite thine hands together and let the sword be doubled the third time the sword of the slain it is the sword of the great men that are slain which entereth into their privy chambers i have set the point of the sword against all their gates that their heart may faint and their ruins be multiplied ah it is made bright it is wrapped up for the slaughter go thee one way or other either on the right hand or on the left whithersoever thy face is set i will also smite mine hands together and i will cause my fury to rest i the lord have said it the word of the lord came unto me again saying also thou son of man appoint thee two ways that the sword of the king of babylon may come both twain shall come forth out of one land and choose thou a place choose it at the head of the way to the city appoint a way that the sword may come to rabbath of the ammonites and to judah in jerusalem the defenced for the king of babylon stood at the parting of the way at the head of the two ways to use divination he made his arrows bright he consulted with images he looked in the liver at his right hand was the divination for jerusalem to appoint captains to open the mouth in the slaughter to lift up the voice with shouting to appoint battering rams against the gates to cast a mount and to build a fort and it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight to them that have sworn oaths but he will call to remembrance the iniquity that they may be taken therefore thus saith the lord god because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered in that your transgressions are discovered so that in all your doings your sins do appear because i say that ye are come to remembrance ye shall be taken with the hand and thou profane wicked prince of israel whose day is come when iniquity shall have an end thus saith the lord god remove the diadem and take off the crown this shall not be the same exalt him that is low and abase him that is high i will overturn overturn overturn it and it shall be no more until he come whose right it is and i will give it him and thou son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord god concerning the ammonites and concerning their reproach even say thou the sword the sword is drawn for the slaughter it is furbished to consume because of the glittering whiles they see vanity unto thee whiles they divine a lie unto thee to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain of the wicked whose day is come when their iniquity shall have an end shall i cause it to return into his sheath i will judge thee in the place where thou wast created in the land of thy nativity and i will pour out mine indignation upon thee i will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men and skilful to destroy thou shalt be for fuel to the fire thy blood shall be in the midst of the land thou shalt be no more remembered for i the lord have spoken it moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying now thou son of man wilt thou judge wilt thou judge the bloody city yea thou shalt shew her all her abominations then say thou thus saith the lord god the city sheddeth blood in the midst of it that her time may come and maketh idols against herself to defile herself thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made and thou hast caused thy days to draw near and art come even unto thy years therefore have i made thee a reproach unto the heathen and a mocking to all countries those that be near and those that be far from thee shall mock thee which art infamous and much vexed behold the princes of israel every one were in thee to their power to shed blood in thee have they set light by father and mother in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow thou hast despised mine holy things and hast profaned my sabbaths in thee are men that carry tales to shed blood and in thee they eat upon the mountains in the midst of thee they commit lewdness in thee have they discovered their fathers nakedness in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution and one hath committed abomination with his neighbour s wife and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law and another in thee hath humbled his sister his father s daughter in thee have they taken gifts to shed blood thou hast taken usury and increase and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion and hast forgotten me saith the lord god behold therefore i have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee can thine heart endure or can thine hands be strong in the days that i shall deal with thee i the lord have spoken it and will do it and i will scatter thee among the heathen and disperse thee in the countries and will consume thy filthiness out of thee and thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen and thou shalt know that i am the lord and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man the house of israel is to me become dross all they are brass and tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace they are even the dross of silver therefore thus saith the lord god because ye are all become dross behold therefore i will gather you into the midst of jerusalem as they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace to blow the fire upon it to melt it so will i gather you in mine anger and in my fury and i will leave you there and melt you yea i will gather you and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof and ye shall know that i the lord have poured out my fury upon you and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man say unto her thou art the land that is not cleansed nor rained upon in the day of indignation there is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof like a roaring lion ravening the prey they have devoured souls they have taken the treasure and precious things they have made her many widows in the midst thereof her priests have violated my law and have profaned mine holy things they have put no difference between the holy and profane neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths and i am profaned among them her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey to shed blood and to destroy souls to get dishonest gain and her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter seeing vanity and divining lies unto them saying thus saith the lord god when the lord hath not spoken the people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery and have vexed the poor and needy yea they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully and i sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that i should not destroy it but i found none therefore have i poured out mine indignation upon them i have consumed them with the fire of my wrath their own way have i recompensed upon their heads saith the lord god the word of the lord came again unto me saying son of man there were two women the daughters of one mother and they committed whoredoms in egypt they committed whoredoms in their youth there were their breasts pressed and there they bruised the teats of their virginity and the names of them were aholah the elder and aholibah her sister and they were mine and they bare sons and daughters thus were their names samaria is aholah and jerusalem aholibah and aholah played the harlot when she was mine and she doted on her lovers on the assyrians her neighbours which were clothed with blue captains and rulers all of them desirable young men horsemen riding upon horses thus she committed her whoredoms with them with all them that were the chosen men of assyria and with all on whom she doted with all their idols she defiled herself neither left she her whoredoms brought from egypt for in her youth they lay with her and they bruised the breasts of her virginity and poured their whoredom upon her wherefore i have delivered her into the hand of her lovers into the hand of the assyrians upon whom she doted these discovered her nakedness they took her sons and her daughters and slew her with the sword and she became famous among women for they had executed judgment upon her and when her sister aholibah saw this she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms she doted upon the assyrians her neighbours captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously horsemen riding upon horses all of them desirable young men then i saw that she was defiled that they took both one way and that she increased her whoredoms for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall the images of the chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion girded with girdles upon their loins exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads all of them princes to look to after the manner of the babylonians of chaldea the land of their nativity and as soon as she saw them with her eyes she doted upon them and sent messengers unto them into chaldea and the babylonians came to her into the bed of love and they defiled her with their whoredom and she was polluted with them and her mind was alienated from them so she discovered her whoredoms and discovered her nakedness then my mind was alienated from her like as my mind was alienated from her sister yet she multiplied her whoredoms in calling to remembrance the days of her youth wherein she had played the harlot in the land of egypt for she doted upon their paramours whose flesh is as the flesh of asses and whose issue is like the issue of horses thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth in bruising thy teats by the egyptians for the paps of thy youth therefore o aholibah thus saith the lord god behold i will raise up thy lovers against thee from whom thy mind is alienated and i will bring them against thee on every side the babylonians and all the chaldeans pekod and shoa and koa and all the assyrians with them all of them desirable young men captains and rulers great lords and renowned all of them riding upon horses and they shall come against thee with chariots wagons and wheels and with an assembly of people which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about and i will set judgment before them and they shall judge thee according to their judgments and i will set my jealousy against thee and they shall deal furiously with thee they shall take away thy nose and thine ears and thy remnant shall fall by the sword they shall take thy sons and thy daughters and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire they shall also strip thee out of thy clothes and take away thy fair jewels thus will i make thy lewdness to cease from thee and thy whoredom brought from the land of egypt so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them nor remember egypt any more for thus saith the lord god behold i will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated and they shall deal with thee hatefully and shall take away all thy labour and shall leave thee naked and bare and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms i will do these things unto thee because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen and because thou art polluted with their idols thou hast walked in the way of thy sister therefore will i give her cup into thine hand thus saith the lord god thou shalt drink of thy sister s cup deep and large thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision it containeth much thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow with the cup of astonishment and desolation with the cup of thy sister samaria thou shalt even drink it and suck it out and thou shalt break the sherds thereof and pluck off thine own breasts for i have spoken it saith the lord god therefore thus saith the lord god because thou hast forgotten me and cast me behind thy back therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms the lord said moreover unto me son of man wilt thou judge aholah and aholibah yea declare unto them their abominations that they have committed adultery and blood is in their hands and with their idols have they committed adultery and have also caused their sons whom they bare unto me to pass for them through the fire to devour them moreover this they have done unto me they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day and have profaned my sabbaths for when they had slain their children to their idols then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it and lo thus have they done in the midst of mine house and furthermore that ye have sent for men to come from far unto whom a messenger was sent and lo they came for whom thou didst wash thyself paintedst thy eyes and deckedst thyself with ornaments and satest upon a stately bed and a table prepared before it whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil and a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her and with the men of the common sort were brought sabeans from the wilderness which put bracelets upon their hands and beautiful crowns upon their heads then said i unto her that was old in adulteries will they now commit whoredoms with her and she with them yet they went in unto her as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot so went they in unto aholah and unto aholibah the lewd women and the righteous men they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses and after the manner of women that shed blood because they are adulteresses and blood is in their hands for thus saith the lord god i will bring up a company upon them and will give them to be removed and spoiled and the company shall stone them with stones and dispatch them with their swords they shall slay their sons and their daughters and burn up their houses with fire thus will i cause lewdness to cease out of the land that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness and they shall recompense your lewdness upon you and ye shall bear the sins of your idols and ye shall know that i am the lord god again in the ninth year in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man write thee the name of the day even of this same day the king of babylon set himself against jerusalem this same day and utter a parable unto the rebellious house and say unto them thus saith the lord god set on a pot set it on and also pour water into it gather the pieces thereof into it even every good piece the thigh and the shoulder fill it with the choice bones take the choice of the flock and burn also the bones under it and make it boil well and let them seethe the bones of it therein wherefore thus saith the lord god woe to the bloody city to the pot whose scum is therein and whose scum is not gone out of it bring it out piece by piece let no lot fall upon it for her blood is in the midst of her she set it upon the top of a rock she poured it not upon the ground to cover it with dust that it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance i have set her blood upon the top of a rock that it should not be covered therefore thus saith the lord god woe to the bloody city i will even make the pile for fire great heap on wood kindle the fire consume the flesh and spice it well and let the bones be burned then set it empty upon the coals thereof that the brass of it may be hot and may burn and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it that the scum of it may be consumed she hath wearied herself with lies and her great scum went not forth out of her her scum shall be in the fire in thy filthiness is lewdness because i have purged thee and thou wast not purged thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more till i have caused my fury to rest upon thee i the lord have spoken it it shall come to pass and i will do it i will not go back neither will i spare neither will i repent according to thy ways and according to thy doings shall they judge thee saith the lord god also the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man behold i take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep neither shall thy tears run down forbear to cry make no mourning for the dead bind the tire of thine head upon thee and put on thy shoes upon thy feet and cover not thy lips and eat not the bread of men so i spake unto the people in the morning and at even my wife died and i did in the morning as i was commanded and the people said unto me wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us that thou doest so then i answered them the word of the lord came unto me saying speak unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god behold i will profane my sanctuary the excellency of your strength the desire of your eyes and that which your soul pitieth and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword and ye shall do as i have done ye shall not cover your lips nor eat the bread of men and your tires shall be upon your heads and your shoes upon your feet ye shall not mourn nor weep but ye shall pine away for your iniquities and mourn one toward another thus ezekiel is unto you a sign according to all that he hath done shall ye do and when this cometh ye shall know that i am the lord god also thou son of man shall it not be in the day when i take from them their strength the joy of their glory the desire of their eyes and that whereupon they set their minds their sons and their daughters that he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee to cause thee to hear it with thine ears in that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped and thou shalt speak and be no more dumb and thou shalt be a sign unto them and they shall know that i am the lord the word of the lord came again unto me saying son of man set thy face against the ammonites and prophesy against them and say unto the ammonites hear the word of the lord god thus saith the lord god because thou saidst aha against my sanctuary when it was profaned and against the land of israel when it was desolate and against the house of judah when they went into captivity behold therefore i will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession and they shall set their palaces in thee and make their dwellings in thee they shall eat thy fruit and they shall drink thy milk and i will make rabbah a stable for camels and the ammonites a couching place for flocks and ye shall know that i am the lord for thus saith the lord god because thou hast clapped thine hands and stamped with the feet and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of israel behold therefore i will stretch out mine hand upon thee and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen and i will cut thee off from the people and i will cause thee to perish out of the countries i will destroy thee and thou shalt know that i am the lord thus saith the lord god because that moab and seir do say behold the house of judah is like unto all the heathen therefore behold i will open the side of moab from the cities from his cities which are on his frontiers the glory of the country bethjeshimoth baalmeon and kiriathaim unto the men of the east with the ammonites and will give them in possession that the ammonites may not be remembered among the nations and i will execute judgments upon moab and they shall know that i am the lord thus saith the lord god because that edom hath dealt against the house of judah by taking vengeance and hath greatly offended and revenged himself upon them therefore thus saith the lord god i will also stretch out mine hand upon edom and will cut off man and beast from it and i will make it desolate from teman and they of dedan shall fall by the sword and i will lay my vengeance upon edom by the hand of my people israel and they shall do in edom according to mine anger and according to my fury and they shall know my vengeance saith the lord god thus saith the lord god because the philistines have dealt by revenge and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart to destroy it for the old hatred therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will stretch out mine hand upon the philistines and i will cut off the cherethims and destroy the remnant of the sea coast and i will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall lay my vengeance upon them and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man because that tyrus hath said against jerusalem aha she is broken that was the gates of the people she is turned unto me i shall be replenished now she is laid waste therefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee o tyrus and will cause many nations to come up against thee as the sea causeth his waves to come up and they shall destroy the walls of tyrus and break down her towers i will also scrape her dust from her and make her like the top of a rock it shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea for i have spoken it saith the lord god and it shall become a spoil to the nations and her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword and they shall know that i am the lord for thus saith the lord god behold i will bring upon tyrus nebuchadrezzar king of babylon a king of kings from the north with horses and with chariots and with horsemen and companies and much people he shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field and he shall make a fort against thee and cast a mount against thee and lift up the buckler against thee and he shall set engines of war against thy walls and with his axes he shall break down thy towers by reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen and of the wheels and of the chariots when he shall enter into thy gates as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach with the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets he shall slay thy people by the sword and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground and they shall make a spoil of thy riches and make a prey of thy merchandise and they shall break down thy walls and destroy thy pleasant houses and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water and i will cause the noise of thy songs to cease and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard and i will make thee like the top of a rock thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon thou shalt be built no more for i the lord have spoken it saith the lord god thus saith the lord god to tyrus shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall when the wounded cry when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones and lay away their robes and put off their broidered garments they shall clothe themselves with trembling they shall sit upon the ground and shall tremble at every moment and be astonished at thee and they shall take up a lamentation for thee and say to thee how art thou destroyed that wast inhabited of seafaring men the renowned city which wast strong in the sea she and her inhabitants which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall yea the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure for thus saith the lord god when i shall make thee a desolate city like the cities that are not inhabited when i shall bring up the deep upon thee and great waters shall cover thee when i shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit with the people of old time and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth in places desolate of old with them that go down to the pit that thou be not inhabited and i shall set glory in the land of the living i will make thee a terror and thou shalt be no more though thou be sought for yet shalt thou never be found again saith the lord god the word of the lord came again unto me saying now thou son of man take up a lamentation for tyrus and say unto tyrus o thou that art situate at the entry of the sea which art a merchant of the people for many isles thus saith the lord god o tyrus thou hast said i am of perfect beauty thy borders are in the midst of the seas thy builders have perfected thy beauty they have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of senir they have taken cedars from lebanon to make masts for thee of the oaks of bashan have they made thine oars the company of the

apparel bound with cords and made of cedar among thy merchandise the ships of tarshish did sing of thee in thy market and thou wast replenished and made very glorious in the midst of the seas thy rowers have brought thee into great waters the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas thy riches and thy fairs thy merchandise thy mariners and thy pilots thy calkers and the occupiers of thy merchandise and all thy men of war that are in thee and in all thy company which is in the midst of thee shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin the suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots and all that handle the oar the mariners and all the pilots of the sea shall come down from their ships they shall stand upon the land and shall cause their voice to be heard against thee and shall cry bitterly and shall cast up dust upon their heads they shall wallow themselves in the ashes and they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee and gird them with sackcloth and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing and in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee and lament over thee saying what city is like tyrus like the destroyed in the midst of the sea when thy wares went forth out of the seas thou filledst many people thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise in the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall all the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee and their kings shall be sore afraid they shall be troubled in their countenance the merchants among the people shall hiss at thee thou shalt be a terror and never shalt be any more the word of the lord came again unto me saying son of man say unto the prince of tyrus thus saith the lord god because thine heart is lifted up and thou hast said i am a god i sit in the seat of god in the midst of the seas yet thou art a man and not god though thou set thine heart as the heart of god behold thou art wiser than daniel there is no secret that they can hide from thee with thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures by thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches therefore thus saith the lord god because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of god behold therefore i will bring strangers upon thee the terrible of the nations and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom and they shall defile thy brightness they shall bring thee down to the pit and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee i am god but thou shalt be a man and no god in the hand of him that slayeth thee thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers for i have spoken it saith the lord god moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus and say unto him thus saith the lord god thou sealest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beauty thou hast been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering the sardius topaz and the diamond the beryl the onyx and the jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so thou wast upon the holy mountain of god thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou hast sinned therefore i will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god and i will destroy thee o covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness i will cast thee to the ground i will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffick therefore will i bring forth a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and i will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee all they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be any more again the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man set thy face against zidon and prophesy against it and say thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee o zidon and i will be glorified in the midst of thee and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall have executed judgments in her and shall be sanctified in her for i will send into her pestilence and blood into her streets and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side and they shall know that i am the lord and there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of israel nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them that despised them and they shall know that i am the lord god thus saith the lord god when i shall have gathered the house of israel from the people among whom they are scattered and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen then shall they dwell in their land that i have given to my servant jacob and they shall dwell safely therein and shall build houses and plant vineyards yea they shall dwell with confidence when i have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them and they shall know that i am the lord their god in the tenth year in the tenth month in the twelfth day of the month the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man set thy face against pharaoh king of egypt and prophesy against him and against all egypt speak and say thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee pharaoh king of egypt the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers which hath said my river is mine own and i have made it for myself but i will put hooks in thy jaws and i will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales and i will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales and i will leave thee thrown into the wilderness thee and all the fish of thy rivers thou shalt fall upon the open fields thou shalt not be brought together nor gathered i have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven and all the inhabitants of egypt shall know that i am the lord because they have been a staff of reed to the house of israel when they took hold of thee by thy hand thou didst break and rend all their shoulder and when they leaned upon thee thou brakest and madest all their loins to be at a stand therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will bring a sword upon thee and cut off man and beast out of thee and the land of egypt shall be desolate and waste and they shall know that i am the lord because he hath said the river is mine and i have made it behold therefore i am against thee and against thy rivers and i will make the land of egypt utterly waste and desolate from the tower of syene even unto the border of ethiopia no foot of man shall pass through it nor foot of beast shall pass through it neither shall it be inhabited forty years and i will make the land of egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the countries yet thus saith the lord god at the end of forty years will i gather the egyptians from the people whither they were scattered and i will bring again the captivity of egypt and will cause them to return into the land of pathros into the land of their habitation and they shall be there a base kingdom it shall be the basest of the kingdoms neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations for i will diminish them that they shall no more rule over the nations and it shall be no more the confidence of the house of israel which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance when they shall look after them but they shall know that i am the lord god and it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year in the first month in the first day of the month the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man nebuchadrezzar king of babylon caused his army to serve a great service against tyrus every head was made bald and every shoulder was peeled yet had he no wages nor his army for tyrus for the service that he had served against it therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will give the land of egypt unto nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall take her multitude and take her spoil and take her prey and it shall be the wages for his army i have given him the land of egypt for his labour wherewith he served against it because they wrought for me saith the lord god in that day will i cause the horn of the house of israel to bud forth and i will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them and they shall know that i am the lord the word of the lord came again unto me saying son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord god howl ye woe worth the day for the day is near even the day of the lord is near a cloudy day it shall be the time of the heathen and the sword shall come upon egypt and great pain shall be in ethiopia when the slain shall fall in egypt and they shall take away her multitude and her foundations shall be broken down ethiopia and libya and lydia and all the mingled people and chub and the men of the land that is in league shall fall with them by the sword thus saith the lord they also that uphold egypt shall fall and the pride of her power shall come down from the tower of syene shall they fall in it by the sword saith the lord god and they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted and they shall know that i am the lord when i have set a fire in egypt and when all her helpers shall be destroyed in that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless ethiopians afraid and great pain shall come upon them as in the day of egypt for lo it cometh thus saith the lord god i will also make the multitude of egypt to cease by the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon he and his people with him the terrible of the nations shall be brought to destroy the land and they shall draw their swords against egypt and fill the land with the slain and i will make the rivers dry and sell the land into the hand of the wicked and i will make the land waste and all that is therein by the hand of strangers i the lord have spoken it thus saith the lord god i will also destroy the idols and i will cause their images to cease out of noph and there shall be no more a prince of the land of egypt and i will put a fear in the land of egypt and i will make pathros desolate and will set fire in zoan and will execute judgments in no and i will pour my fury upon sin the strength of egypt and i will cut off the multitude of no and i will set fire in egypt sin shall have great pain and no shall be rent asunder and noph shall have distresses daily the young men of aven and of pibeseth shall fall by the sword and these cities shall go into captivity at tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened when i shall break there the yokes of egypt and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her as for her a cloud shall cover her and her daughters shall go into captivity thus will i execute judgments in egypt and they shall know that i am the lord and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first month in the seventh day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man i have broken the arm of pharaoh king of egypt and lo it shall not be bound up to be healed to put a roller to bind it to make it strong to hold the sword therefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against pharaoh king of egypt and will break his arms the strong and that which was broken and i will cause the sword to fall out of his hand and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the countries and i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon and put my sword in his hand but i will break pharaoh s arms and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man but i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon and the arms of pharaoh shall fall down and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall put my sword into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall stretch it out upon the land of egypt and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the countries and they shall know that i am the lord and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the third month in the first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man speak unto pharaoh king of egypt and to his multitude whom art thou like in thy greatness behold the assyrian was a cedar in lebanon with fair branches and with a shadowing shroud and of an high stature and his top was among the thick boughs the waters made him great the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field and his boughs were multiplied and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters when he shot forth all the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young and under his shadow dwelt all great nations thus was he fair in his greatness in the length of his branches for his root was by great waters the cedars in the garden of god could not hide him the fir trees were not like his boughs and the chestnut trees were not like his branches nor any tree in the garden of god was like unto him in his beauty i have made him fair by the multitude of his branches so that all the trees of eden that were in the garden of god envied him therefore thus saith the lord god because thou hast lifted up thyself in height and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs and his heart is lifted up in his height i have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen he shall surely deal with him i have driven him out for his wickedness and strangers the terrible of the nations have cut him off and have left him upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow and have left him upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs neither their trees stand up in their height all that drink water for they are all delivered unto death to the nether parts of the earth in the midst of the children of men with them that go down to the pit thus saith the lord god in the day when he went down to the grave i caused a mourning i covered the deep for him and i restrained the floods thereof and the great waters were stayed and i caused lebanon to mourn for him and all the trees of the field fainted for him i made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall when i cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit and all the trees of eden the choice and best of lebanon all that drink water shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth they also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword and they that were his arm that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen to whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of eden yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of eden unto the nether parts of the earth thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword this is pharaoh and all his multitude saith the lord god and it came to pass in the twelfth year in the twelfth month in the first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation for pharaoh king of egypt and say unto him thou art like a young lion of the nations and thou art as a whale in the seas and thou camest forth with thy rivers and troubledst the waters with thy feet and fouledst their rivers thus saith the lord god i will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people and they shall bring thee up in my net then will i leave thee upon the land i will cast thee forth upon the open field and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee and i will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee and i will lay thy flesh upon the mountains and fill the valleys with thy height i will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest even to the mountains and the rivers shall be full of thee and when i shall put thee out i will cover the heaven and make the stars thereof dark i will cover the sun with a cloud and the moon shall not give her light all the bright lights of heaven will i make dark over thee and set darkness upon thy land saith the lord god i will also vex the hearts of many people when i shall bring thy destruction among the nations into the countries which thou hast not known yea i will make many people amazed at thee and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee when i shall brandish my sword before them and they shall tremble at every moment every man for his own life in the day of thy fall for thus saith the lord god the sword of the king of babylon shall come upon thee by the swords of the mighty will i cause thy multitude to fall the terrible of the nations all of them and they shall spoil the pomp of egypt and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed i will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them then will i make their waters deep and cause their rivers to run like oil saith the lord god when i shall make the land of egypt desolate and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full when i shall smite all them that dwell therein then shall they know that i am the lord this is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her the daughters of the nations shall lament her they shall lament for her even for egypt and for all her multitude saith the lord god it came to pass also in the twelfth year in the fifteenth day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man wail for the multitude of egypt and cast them down even her and the daughters of the famous nations unto the nether parts of the earth with them that go down into the pit whom dost thou pass in beauty go down and be thou laid with the uncircumcised they shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword she is delivered to the sword draw her and all her multitudes the strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him they are gone down they lie uncircumcised slain by the sword asshur is there and all her company his graves are about him all of them slain fallen by the sword whose graves are set in the sides of the pit and her company is round about her grave all of them slain fallen by the sword which caused terror in the land of the living there is elam and all her multitude round about her grave all of them slain fallen by the sword which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth which caused their terror in the land of the living yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit they have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude her graves are round about him all of them uncircumcised slain by the sword though their terror was caused in the land of the living yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit he is put in the midst of them that be slain there is meshech tubal and all her multitude her graves are round about him all of them uncircumcised slain by the sword though they caused their terror in the land of the living and they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war and they have laid their swords under their heads but their iniquities shall be upon their bones though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living yea thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword there is edom her kings and all her princes which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword they shall lie with the uncircumcised and with them that go down to the pit there be the princes of the north all of them and all the zidonians which are gone down with the slain with their terror they are ashamed of their might and they lie uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit pharaoh shall see them and shall be comforted over all his multitude even pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword saith the lord god for i have caused my terror in the land of the living and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword even pharaoh and all his multitude saith the lord god again the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man speak to the children of thy people and say unto them when i bring the sword upon a land if the people of the land take a man of their coasts and set him for their watchman if when he seeth the sword come upon the land he blow the trumpet and warn the people then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet and taketh not warning if the sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own head he heard the sound of the trumpet and took not warning his blood shall be upon him but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul but if the watchman see the sword come and blow not the trumpet and the people be not warned if the sword come and take any person from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood will i require at the watchman s hand so thou o son of man i have set thee a watchman unto the house of israel therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth and warn them from me when i say unto the wicked o wicked man thou shalt surely die if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way that wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will i require at thine hand nevertheless if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it if he do not turn from his way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soul therefore o thou son of man speak unto the house of israel thus ye speak saying if our transgressions and our sins be upon us and we pine away in them how should we then live say unto them as i live saith the lord god i have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn ye turn ye from your evil ways for why will ye die o house of israel therefore thou son of man say unto the children of thy people the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression as for the wickedness of the wicked he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth when i shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live if he trust to his own righteousness and commit iniquity all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered but for his iniquity that he hath committed he shall die for it again when i say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die if he turn from his sin and do that which is lawful and right if the wicked restore the pledge give again that he had robbed walk in the statutes of life without committing iniquity he shall surely live he shall not die none of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him he hath done that which is lawful and right he shall surely live yet the children of thy people say the way of the lord is not equal but as for them their way is not equal when the righteous turneth from his righteousness and committeth iniquity he shall even die thereby but if the wicked turn from his wickedness and do that which is lawful and right he shall live thereby yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal o ye house of israel i will judge you every one after his ways and it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity in the tenth month in the fifth day of the month that one that had escaped out of jerusalem came unto me saying the city is smitten now the hand of the lord was upon me in the evening afore he that was escaped came and had opened my mouth until he came to me in the morning and my mouth was opened and i was no more dumb then the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man they that inhabit those wastes of the land of israel speak saying abraham was one and he inherited the land but we are many the land is given us for inheritance wherefore say unto them thus saith the lord god ye eat with the blood and lift up your eyes toward your idols and shed blood and shall ye possess the land ye stand upon your sword ye work abomination and ye defile every one his neighbour s wife and shall ye possess the land say thou thus unto them thus saith the lord god as i live surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword and him that is in the open field will i give to the beasts to be devoured and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence for i will lay the land most desolate and the pomp of her strength shall cease and the mountains of israel shall be desolate that none shall pass through then shall they know that i am the lord when i have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed also thou son of man the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses and speak one to another every one to his brother saying come i pray you and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the lord and they come unto thee as the people cometh and they sit before thee as my people and they hear thy words but they will not do them for with their mouth they shew much love but their heart goeth after their covetousness and lo thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument for they hear thy words but they do them not and when this cometh to pass lo it will come then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man prophesy against the shepherds of israel prophesy and say unto them thus saith the lord god unto the shepherds woe be to the shepherds of israel that do feed themselves should not the shepherds feed the flocks ye eat the fat and ye clothe you with the wool ye kill them that are fed but ye feed not the flock the diseased have ye not strengthened neither have ye healed that which was sick neither have ye bound up that which was broken neither have ye brought again that which was driven away neither have ye sought that which was lost but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them and they were scattered because there is no shepherd and they became meat to all the beasts of the field when they were scattered my sheep wandered through all the mountains and upon every high hill yea my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth and none did search or seek after them therefore ye shepherds hear the word of the lord as i live saith the lord god surely because my flock became a prey and my flock became meat to every beast of the field because there was no shepherd neither did my shepherds search for my flock but the shepherds fed themselves and fed not my flock therefore o ye shepherds hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god behold i am against the shepherds and i will require my flock at their hand and cause them to cease from feeding the flock neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more for i will deliver my flock from their mouth that they may not be meat for them for thus saith the lord god behold i even i will both search my sheep and seek them out as a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered so will i seek out my sheep and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day and i will bring them out from the people and gather them from the countries and will bring them to their own land and feed them upon the mountains of israel by the rivers and in all the inhabited places of the country i will feed them in a good pasture and upon the high mountains of israel shall their fold be there shall they lie in a good fold and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of israel i will feed my flock and i will cause them to lie down saith the lord god i will seek that which was lost and bring again that which was driven away and will bind up that which was broken and will strengthen that which was sick but i will destroy the fat and the strong i will feed them with judgment and as for you o my flock thus saith the lord god behold i judge between cattle and cattle between the rams and the he goats seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures and to have drunk of the deep waters but ye must foul the residue with your feet and as for my flock they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet therefore thus saith the lord god unto them behold i even i will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder and pushed all the diseased with your horns till ye have scattered them abroad therefore will i save my flock and they shall no more be a prey and i will judge between cattle and cattle and i will set up one shepherd over them and he shall feed them even my servant david he shall feed them and he shall be their shepherd and i the lord will be their god and my servant david a prince among them i the lord have spoken it and i will make with them a covenant of peace and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods and i will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing and i will cause the shower to come down in his season there shall be showers of blessing and the tree of the field shall yield her fruit and the earth shall yield her increase and they shall be safe in their land and shall know that i am the lord when i have broken the bands of their yoke and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them and they shall no more be a prey to the heathen neither shall the beast of the land devour them but they shall dwell safely and none shall make them afraid and i will raise up for them a plant of renown and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land neither bear the shame of the heathen any more thus shall they know that i the lord their god am with them and that they even the house of israel are my people saith the lord god and ye my flock the flock of my pasture are men and i am your god saith the lord god moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man set thy face against mount seir and prophesy against it and say unto it thus saith the lord god behold o mount seir i am against thee and i will stretch out mine hand against thee and i will make thee most desolate i will lay thy cities waste and thou shalt be desolate and thou shalt know that i am the lord because thou hast had a perpetual hatred and hast shed the blood of the children of israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity in the time that their iniquity had an end therefore as i live saith the lord god i will prepare thee unto blood and blood shall pursue thee sith thou hast not hated blood even blood shall pursue thee thus will i make mount seir most desolate and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth and i will fill his mountains with his slain men in thy hills and in thy valleys and in all thy rivers shall they fall that are slain with the sword i will make thee perpetual desolations and thy cities shall not return and ye shall know that i am the lord because thou hast said these two nations and these two countries shall be mine and we will possess it whereas the lord was there therefore as i live saith the lord god i will even do according to thine anger and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them and i will make myself known among them when i have judged thee and thou shalt know that i am the lord and that i have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of israel saying they are laid desolate they are given us to consume thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me and have multiplied your words against me i have heard them thus saith the lord god when the whole earth rejoiceth i will make thee desolate as thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of israel because it was desolate so will i do unto thee thou shalt be desolate o mount seir and all idumea even all of it and they shall know that i am the lord also thou son of man prophesy unto the mountains of israel and say ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god because the enemy hath said against you aha even the ancient high places are ours in possession therefore prophesy and say thus saith the lord god because they have made you desolate and swallowed you up on every side that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers and are an infamy of the people therefore ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord god thus saith the lord god to the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round about therefore thus saith the lord god surely in the fire of my jealousy have i spoken against the residue of the heathen and against all idumea which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart with despiteful minds to cast it out for a prey prophesy therefore concerning the land of israel and say unto the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys thus saith the lord god behold i have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury because ye have borne the shame of the heathen therefore thus saith the lord god i have lifted up mine hand surely the heathen that are about you they shall bear their shame but ye o mountains of israel ye shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to my people of israel for they are at hand to come for behold i am for you and i will turn unto you and ye shall be tilled and sown and i will multiply men upon you all the house of israel even all of it and the cities shall be inhabited and the wastes shall be builded and i will multiply upon you man and beast and they shall increase and bring fruit and i will settle you after your old estates and will do better unto you than at your beginnings and ye shall know that i am the lord yea i will cause men to walk upon you even my people israel and they shall possess thee and thou shalt be their inheritance and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men thus saith the lord god because they say unto you thou land devourest up men and hast bereaved thy nations therefore thou shalt devour men no more neither bereave thy nations any more saith the lord god neither will i cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more saith the lord god moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man when the house of israel dwelt in their own land they defiled it by their own way and by their doings their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman wherefore i poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it and i scattered them among the heathen and they were dispersed through the countries according to their way and according to their doings i judged them and when they entered unto the heathen whither they went they profaned my holy name when they said to them these are the people of the lord and are gone forth out of his land but i had pity for mine holy name which the house of israel had profaned among the heathen whither they went therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god i do not this for your sakes o house of israel but for mine holy name s sake which ye have profaned among the heathen whither ye went and i will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the heathen which ye have profaned in the midst of them and the heathen shall know that i am the lord saith the lord god when i shall be sanctified in you before their eyes for i will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then will i sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you an heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers and ye shall be my people and i will be your god i will also save you from all your uncleannesses and i will call for the corn and will increase it and lay no famine upon you and i will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen then shall ye remember your own evil ways and your doings that were not good and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations not for your sakes do i this saith the lord god be it known unto you be ashamed and confounded for your own ways o house of israel thus saith the lord god in the day that i shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities i will also cause you to dwell in the cities and the wastes shall be builded and the desolate land shall be tilled whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by and they shall say this land that was desolate is become like the garden of eden and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced and are inhabited then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that i the lord build the ruined places and plant that that was desolate i the lord have spoken it and i will do it thus saith the lord god i will yet for this be enquired of by the house of israel to do it for them i will increase them with men like a flock as the holy flock as the flock of jerusalem in her solemn feasts so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men and they shall know that i am the lord the hand of the lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open valley and lo they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and i answered o lord god thou knowest again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them o ye dry bones hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god unto these bones behold i will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live and i will lay sinews upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and ye shall live and ye shall know that i am the lord so i prophesied as i was commanded and as i prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone and when i beheld lo the sinews and the flesh came up upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them then said he unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus saith the lord god come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live so i prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great army then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off for our parts therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the lord god behold o my people i will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves and bring you into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have opened your graves o my people and brought you up out of your graves and shall put my spirit in you and ye shall live and i shall place you in your own land then shall ye know that i the lord have spoken it and performed it saith the lord the word of the lord came again unto me saying moreover thou son of man take thee one stick and write upon it for judah and for the children of israel his companions then take another stick and write upon it for joseph the stick of ephraim and for all the house of israel his companions and join them one to another into one stick and they shall become one in thine hand and when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee saying wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these say unto them thus saith the lord god behold i will take the stick of joseph which is in the hand of ephraim and the tribes of israel his fellows and will put them with him even with the stick of judah and make them one stick and they shall be one in mine hand and the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes and say unto them thus saith the lord god behold i will take the children of israel from among the heathen whither they be gone and will gather them on every side and bring them into their own land and i will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of israel and one king shall be king to them all and they shall be no more two nations neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols nor with their detestable things nor with any of their transgressions but i will save them out of all their dwellingplaces wherein they have sinned and will cleanse them so shall they be my people and i will be their god and david my servant shall be king over them and they all shall have one shepherd they shall also walk in my judgments and observe my statutes and do them and they shall dwell in the land that i have given unto jacob my servant wherein your fathers have dwelt and they shall dwell therein even they and their children and their children s children for ever and my servant david shall be their prince for ever moreover i will make a covenant of peace with them it shall be an everlasting covenant with them and i will place them and multiply them and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore my tabernacle also shall be with them yea i will be their god and they shall be my people and the heathen shall know that i the lord do sanctify israel when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man set thy face against gog the land of magog the chief prince of meshech and tubal and prophesy against him and say thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee o gog the chief prince of meshech and tubal and i will turn thee back and put hooks into thy jaws and i will bring thee forth and all thine army horses and horsemen all of them clothed with all sorts of armour even a great company with bucklers and shields all of them handling swords persia ethiopia and libya with them all of them with shield and helmet gomer and all his bands the house of togarmah of the north quarters and all his bands and many people with thee be thou prepared and prepare for thyself thou and all thy company that are assembled unto thee and be thou a guard unto them after many days thou shalt be visited in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword and is gathered out of many people against the mountains of israel which have been always waste but it is brought forth out of the nations and they shall dwell safely all of them thou shalt ascend and come like a storm thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land thou and all thy bands and many people with thee thus saith the lord god it shall also come to pass that at the same time shall things come into thy mind and thou shalt think an evil thought and thou shalt say i will go up to the land of unwalled villages i will go to them that are at rest that dwell safely all of them dwelling without walls and having neither bars nor gates to take a spoil and to take a prey to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations which have gotten cattle and goods that dwell in the midst of the land sheba and dedan and the merchants of tarshish with all the young lions thereof shall say unto thee art thou come to take a spoil hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey to carry away silver and gold to take away cattle and goods to take a great spoil therefore son of man prophesy and say unto gog thus saith the lord god in that day when my people of israel dwelleth safely shalt thou not know it and thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts thou and many people with thee all of them riding upon horses a great company and a mighty army and thou shalt come up against my people of israel as a cloud to cover the land it shall be in the latter days and i will bring thee against my land that the heathen may know me when i shall be sanctified in thee o gog before their eyes thus saith the lord god art thou he of whom i have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of israel which prophesied in those days many years that i would bring thee against them and it shall come to pass at the same time when gog shall come against the land of israel saith the lord god that my fury shall come up in my face for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have i spoken surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of israel so that the fishes of the sea and the fowls of the heaven and the beasts of the field and all creeping things that creep upon the earth and all the men that are upon the face of the earth shall shake at my presence and the mountains shall be thrown down and the steep places shall fall and every wall shall fall to the ground and i will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains saith the lord god every man s sword shall be against his brother and i will plead against him with pestilence and with blood and i will rain upon him and upon his bands and upon the many people that are with him an overflowing rain and great hailstones fire and brimstone thus will i magnify myself and sanctify myself and i will be known in the eyes of many nations and they shall know that i am the lord therefore thou son of man prophesy against gog and say thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee o gog the chief prince of meshech and tubal and i will turn thee back and leave but the sixth part of thee and will cause thee to come up from the north parts and will bring thee upon the mountains of israel and i will smite thy bow out of thy left hand and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand thou shalt fall upon the mountains of israel thou and all thy bands and the people that is with thee i will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort and to the beasts of the field to be devoured thou shalt fall upon the open field for i have spoken it saith the lord god and i will send a fire on magog and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles and they shall know that i am the lord so will i make my holy name known in the midst of my people israel and i will not let them pollute my holy name any more and the heathen shall know that i am the lord the holy one in israel behold it is come and it is done saith the lord god this is the day whereof i have spoken and they that dwell in the cities of israel shall go forth and shall set on fire and burn the weapons both the shields and the bucklers the bows and the arrows and the handstaves and the spears and they shall burn them with fire seven years so that they shall take no wood out of the field neither cut down any out of the forests for they shall burn the weapons with fire and they shall spoil those that spoiled them and rob those that robbed them saith the lord god and it shall come to pass in that day that i will give unto gog a place there of graves in israel the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea and it shall stop the noses of the passengers and there shall they bury gog and all his multitude and they shall call it the valley of hamongog and seven months shall the house of israel be burying of them that they may cleanse the land yea all the people of the land shall bury them and it shall be to them a renown the day that i shall be glorified saith the lord god and they shall sever out men of continual employment passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth to cleanse it after the end of seven months shall they search and the passengers that pass through the land when any seeth a man s bone then shall he set up a sign by it till the buriers have buried it in the valley of hamongog and also the name of the city shall be hamonah thus shall they cleanse the land and thou son of man thus saith the lord god speak unto every feathered fowl and to every beast of the field assemble yourselves and come gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that i do sacrifice for you even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of israel that ye may eat flesh and drink blood ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the princes of the earth of rams of lambs and of goats of bullocks all of them fatlings of bashan and ye shall eat fat till ye be full and drink blood till ye be drunken of my sacrifice which i have sacrificed for you thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots with mighty men and with all men of war saith the lord god and i will set my glory among the heathen and all the heathen shall see my judgment that i have executed and my hand that i have laid upon them so the house of israel shall know that i am the lord their god from that day and forward and the heathen shall know that the house of israel went into captivity for their iniquity because they trespassed against me therefore hid i my face from them and gave them into the hand of their enemies so fell they all by the sword according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have i done unto them and hid my face from them therefore thus saith the lord god now will i bring again the captivity of jacob and have mercy upon the whole house of israel and will be jealous for my holy name after that they have borne their shame and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me when they dwelt safely in their land and none made them afraid when i have brought them again from the people and gathered them out of their enemies lands and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations then shall they know that i am the lord their god which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen but i have gathered them unto their own land and have left none of them any more there neither will i hide my face any more from them for i have poured out my spirit upon the house of israel saith the lord god in the five and twentieth year of our captivity in the beginning of the year in the tenth day of the

and my holy name shall the house of israel no more defile neither they nor their kings by their whoredom nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places in their setting of their threshold by my thresholds and their post by my posts and the wall between me and them they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed wherefore i have consumed them in mine anger now let them put away their whoredom and the carcases of their kings far from me and i will dwell in the midst of them for ever thou son of man shew the house to the house of israel that they may be ashamed of their iniquities and let them measure the pattern and if they be ashamed of all that they have done shew them the form of the house and the fashion thereof and the goings out thereof

toward the east and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he did on the sabbath day then he shall go forth and after his going forth one shall shut the gate thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the lord of a lamb of the first year without blemish thou shalt prepare it every morning and thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning the sixth part of an ephah and the third part of an hin of oil to temper with the fine flour a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the lord thus shall they prepare the lamb and the meat offering and the oil every morning for a continual burnt offering thus saith the lord god if the prince give a gift unto any of his sons the inheritance thereof shall be his sons it shall be their possession by inheritance but if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants then it shall be his to the year of liberty after it shall return to the prince but his inheritance shall be his sons for them moreover the prince shall not take of the people s inheritance by oppression to thrust them out of their possession but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession that my people be not scattered every man from his possession after he brought me through the entry which was at the side of the gate into the holy chambers of the priests which looked toward the north and behold there was a place on the two sides westward then said he unto me this is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering where they shall bake the meat offering that they bear them not out into the utter court to sanctify the people then he brought me forth into the utter court and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court and behold in every corner of the court there was a court in the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad these four corners were of one measure and there was a row of building round about in them round about them four and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about then said he unto me these are the places of them that boil where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house and behold waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward for the forefront of the house stood toward the east and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house at the south side of the altar then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward and behold there ran out waters on the right side and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward he measured a thousand cubits and he brought me through the waters the waters were to the ankles again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters the waters were to the knees again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters were to the loins afterward he measured a thousand and it was a river that i could not pass over for the waters were risen waters to swim in a river that could not be passed over and he said unto me son of man hast thou seen this then he brought me and caused me to return to the brink of the river now when i had returned behold at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other then said he unto me these waters issue out toward the east country and go down into the desert and go into the sea which being brought forth into the sea the waters shall be healed and it shall come to pass that every thing that liveth which moveth whithersoever the rivers shall come shall live and there shall be a very great multitude of fish because these waters shall come thither for they shall be healed and every thing shall live whither the river cometh and it shall come to pass that the fishers shall stand upon it from engedi even unto eneglaim they shall be a place to spread forth nets their fish shall be according to their kinds as the fish of the great sea exceeding many but the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed they shall be given to salt and by the river upon the bank thereof on this side and on that side shall grow all trees for meat whose leaf shall not fade neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary and the fruit thereof shall be for meat and the leaf thereof for medicine thus saith the lord god this shall be the border whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of israel joseph shall have two portions and ye shall inherit it one as well
