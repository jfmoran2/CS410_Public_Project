at savatthi monks there are these seven properties which seven the property of light the property of beauty when this was said a certain monk addressed the blessed one lord with regard to the property of light the property of the cessation of feeling perception in dependence on what are these properties discerned monk the property of light is discerned in dependence on darkness the property of beauty is discerned in dependence on the unattractive the property of the dimension of the infinitude of space is discerned in dependence on form the property of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness is discerned in dependence on the dimension of the infinitude of space the property of the dimension of nothingness is discerned in dependence on the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the property of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception is discerned in dependence on the dimension of nothingness the property of the cessation of feeling perception is discerned in dependence on cessation but lord with regard to the property of light the property of the cessation of feeling perception how is the attainment of these properties to be reached monk the property of light the property of beauty the property of the dimension of the infinitude of space the property of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the property of the dimension of nothingness these properties are to be reached as perception attainments thus have i heard at one time the lord was journeying among the mallas together with a large order of bhikkhus and came to the brahman village of the mallas called thuna the brahman householders who lived in thuna heard the recluse gotama the sakyan son who went forth from the sakya clan has been journeying among the mallas together with a large order of bhikkhus and has arrived at thuna they then filled the well to the brim with grass and chaff thinking don t let those shaven headed recluses get water to drink then the lord stepped off the road and going up to the foot of a certain tree sat down on a seat prepared for him sitting there the lord addressed the venerable ananda come ananda fetch me some water from that well thereupon the venerable ananda said to the lord just now revered sir the brahman householders living in thuna filled the well to the brim with grass and chaff thinking don t let those shaven headed recluses get water to drink then a second time the lord addressed the venerable ananda come ananda fetch me some water and a second time the venerable ananda said to the lord just now revered sir the brahman householders filled the well to the brim with grass and chaff then for a third time the lord addressed the venerable ananda come ananda fetch me some water from that well yes revered sir the venerable ananda replied and taking a bowl he went to the well now as the venerable ananda was approaching it the well threw up all its grass and chaff from its mouth and stood filled to the brim with pure clean clear water as if it were overflowing then the venerable ananda thought it is indeed wonderful it is indeed marvellous the great supernormal potency and power of the tathagata as i was approaching this well it threw up all that grass and chaff from its mouth and now stands filled to the brim with pure clean clear water as if it were overflowing and taking some water in the bowl he approached the lord and said it is indeed wonderful it is indeed marvellous the great supernormal potency and power of the tathagata this well now stands filled to the brim with pure clean clear water as if it were overflowing drink the water lord drink the water sugata then on realizing its significance the lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance what use is there for a well if there is water everywhere when craving s root is severed what should one go about seeking on one occasion ven a virtuous monk kotthita my friend should attend in an appropriate way to the five clinging aggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness not self which five form as a clinging aggregate feeling perception fabrications consciousness as a clinging aggregate a virtuous monk should attend in an appropriate way to these five clinging aggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness not self for it is possible that a virtuous monk attending in an appropriate way to these five clinging aggregates as inconstant not self would realize the fruit of stream entry then which things should a monk who has attained stream entry attend to in an appropriate way a monk who has attained stream entry should attend in an appropriate way to these five clinging aggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness not self for it is possible that a monk who has attained stream entry attending in an appropriate way to these five clinging aggregates as inconstant not self would realize the fruit of once returning then which things should a monk who has attained once returning attend to in an appropriate way a monk who has attained once returning should attend in an appropriate way to these five clinging aggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness not self for it is possible that a monk who has attained once returning attending in an appropriate way to these five clinging aggregates as inconstant not self would realize the fruit of non returning then which things should a monk who has attained non returning attend to in an appropriate way a monk who has attained non returning should attend in an appropriate way to these five clinging aggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness not self for it is possible that a monk who has attained non returning attending in an appropriate way to these five clinging aggregates as inconstant not self would realize the fruit of arahantship then which things should an arahant attend to in an appropriate way an arahant should attend in an appropriate way to these five clinging aggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness not self although for an arahant there is nothing further to do and nothing to add to what has been done still these things when developed pursued lead both to a pleasant abiding in the here now and to mindfulness alertness i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in the yes lord the monks replied the blessed one said monks there are these and how has a monk abandoned five factors there is the case where a monk s sensual desire is abandoned his ill will his sloth torpor his restlessness anxiety his uncertainty is abandoned this is how a monk has abandoned five factors and how is a monk endowed with six factors there is the case where a monk on seeing a form via the eye is not gladdened not saddened but remains equanimous mindful alert on hearing a sound via the ear on smelling an aroma via the nose on tasting a flavor via the tongue on touching a tactile sensation via the body on cognizing an idea via the intellect he is not gladdened not saddened but remains equanimous mindful alert this is how a monk is endowed with six factors and how does a monk guard one factor there is the case where a monk is endowed with an awareness guarded by mindfulness this is how a monk guards one factor and how is a monk supported in four ways there is the case where a monk carefully reflecting follows one thing tolerates another avoids another and destroys another this is how a monk is supported in four ways and how has a monk shaken off factional truths there is the case where a monk has shaken off the run of the mill factional truths of run of the mill brahmans contemplatives in other words the cosmos is eternal the cosmos is not eternal the cosmos is finite the cosmos is infinite the soul the body are the same the soul is one thing and the body another after death a tathagata exists after death a tathagata does not exist after death a tathagata both does does not exist after death a tathagata neither does nor does not exist all of these he has thrown off shaken off renounced vomited up let go abandoned relinquished this is how a monk has shaken off factional truths and how has a monk thoroughly given up searching there is the case where a monk has abandoned his search for sensuality his search for becoming his search for a holy life and how is a monk undisturbed in his resolves there is the case where a monk has abandoned his resolve for sensuality his resolve for ill will his resolve for harmfulness this is how a monk is undisturbed in his resolves and how is a monk calmed in his bodily fabrication and how is a monk well released in mind there is the case where a monk s mind is released from passion released from aversion released from delusion this is how a monk is well released in mind and how is a monk well released in discernment there is the case where a monk discerns passion is abandoned in me its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising he discerns aversion is abandoned in me its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising he discerns delusion is abandoned in me its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising this is how a monk is well released in discernment monks all those in the past who have dwelled in noble dwellings have dwelled in these same ten noble dwellings all those in the future who will dwell in noble dwellings will dwell in these same ten noble dwellings all those in the present who dwell in noble dwellings dwell in these same ten noble dwellings these are the ten noble dwellings in which noble ones have dwelled dwell and will dwell monks these two slander the tathagata which two he who explains a discourse whose meaning needs to be inferred as one whose meaning has already been fully drawn out and he who explains a discourse whose meaning has already been fully drawn out as one whose meaning needs to be inferred these are two who slander the tathagata once no my friend the eye is not the fetter of forms nor are forms the fetter of the eye whatever desire passion arises in dependence on the two of them that is the fetter there the ear is not the fetter of sounds the nose is not the fetter of aromas the tongue is not the fetter of flavors the body is not the fetter of tactile sensations the intellect is not the fetter of ideas nor are ideas the fetter of the intellect whatever desire passion arises in dependence on the two of them that is the fetter there no my friend the black ox is not the fetter of the white ox nor is the white ox the fetter of the black the single collar or yoke by which they are joined that is the fetter there in the same way the eye is not the fetter of forms nor are forms the fetter of the eye whatever desire passion arises in dependence on the two of them that is the fetter there the ear is not the fetter of sounds the nose is not the fetter of aromas the tongue is not the fetter of flavors the body is not the fetter of tactile sensations the intellect is not the fetter of ideas nor are ideas the fetter of the intellect whatever desire passion arises in dependence on the two of them that is the fetter there if the eye were the fetter of forms or if forms were the fetter of the eye then this holy life for the right ending of stress suffering would not be proclaimed but because whatever desire passion arises in dependence on the two of them is the fetter there that is why this holy life for the right ending of stress suffering is proclaimed if the ear were the fetter if the nose were the fetter if the tongue were the fetter if the body were the fetter if the intellect were the fetter of ideas or if ideas were the fetter of the intellect then this holy life for the right ending of stress suffering would not be proclaimed but because whatever desire passion arises in dependence on the two of them is the fetter there that is why this holy life for the right ending of stress suffering is proclaimed and through this line of reasoning one may know how the eye is not the fetter of forms nor are forms the fetter of the eye but whatever desire passion arises in dependence on the two of them that is the fetter there the ear is not the fetter of sounds the nose is not the fetter of aromas the tongue is not the fetter of flavors the body is not the fetter of tactile sensations the intellect is not the fetter of ideas nor are ideas the fetter of the intellect but whatever desire passion arises in dependence on the two of them that is the fetter there there is an eye in the blessed one the blessed one sees forms with the eye there is no desire or passion in the blessed one the blessed one is well released in mind there is an ear in the blessed one there is a nose in the blessed one there is a tongue in the blessed one there is a body in the blessed one there is an intellect in the blessed one the blessed one knows ideas with the intellect there is no desire or passion in the blessed one the blessed one is well released in mind it is through this line of reasoning that one may know how the eye is not the fetter of forms nor are forms the fetter of the eye but whatever desire passion arises in dependence on the two of them that is the fetter there the ear is not the fetter of sounds the nose is not the fetter of aromas the tongue is not the fetter of flavors the body is not the fetter of tactile sensations the intellect is not the fetter of ideas nor are ideas the fetter of the intellect but whatever desire passion arises in dependence on the two of them that is the fetter there i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near now on that occasion the wanderers of other persuasions had come together in a gathering and were sitting discussing many kinds of bestial topics then anathapindika the householder went to where the wanderers of other persuasions were staying on arrival he greeted them courteously after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there the wanderers said to him tell us householder what views gotama the contemplative has venerable sirs i don t know entirely what views the blessed one has well well so you don t know entirely what views gotama the contemplative has then tell us what views the monks have i don t even know entirely what views the monks have so you don t know entirely what views gotama the contemplative has or even that the monks have then tell us what views you have it wouldn t be difficult for me to expound to you what views i have but please let the venerable ones expound each in line with his position and then it won t be difficult for me to expound to you what views i have when this had been said one of the wanderers said to anathapindika the householder another wanderer said to anathapindika another wanderer said when this had been said anathapindika the householder said to the wanderers as for the venerable one who says when this had been said the wanderers said to anathapindika the householder we have each every one expounded to you in line with our own positions now tell us what views you have whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstant whatever is inconstant is stress whatever is stress is not me is not what i am is not my self this is the sort of view i have so householder whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstant whatever is inconstant is stress you thus adhere to that very stress submit yourself to that very stress venerable sirs whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstant whatever is inconstant is stress whatever is stress is not me is not what i am is not my self having seen this well with right discernment as it actually is present i also discern the higher escape from it as it actually is present when this had been said the wanderers fell silent abashed sitting with their shoulders drooping their heads down brooding at a loss for words anathapindika the householder perceiving that the wanderers were silent abashed at a loss for words got up went to where the blessed one was staying on arrival having bowed down to the blessed one he sat to one side as he was seated there he told the blessed one the entirety of his conversation with the wanderers the blessed one said well done householder well done that is how you should periodically refute those foolish men with the dhamma then he instructed urged roused and encouraged anathapindika the householder with a talk on dhamma when anathapindika the householder had been instructed urged roused and encouraged by the blessed one with a talk on dhamma he got up from his seat and having bowed down to the blessed one left keeping the blessed one on his right side not long afterward the blessed one addressed the monks monks even a monk who has long penetrated the dhamma in this doctrine and discipline would do well to refute the wanderers of other persuasions with the dhamma periodically in just the way anathapindika the householder has done on one occasion the blessed one was staying at an unbroken colt tied to the feeding trough is absorbed with the thought barley grain barley grain why is that because as he is tied to the feeding trough the thought does not occur to him i wonder what task the trainer will have me do today what should i do in response tied to the feeding trough he is simply absorbed with the thought barley grain barley grain in the same way there are cases where an unbroken colt of a man having gone to the wilderness to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling dwells with his awareness overcome by sensual passion obsessed with sensual passion he does not discern the escape as it actually is present from sensual passion once it has arisen making that sensual passion the focal point he absorbs himself with it besorbs resorbs supersorbs himself with it he dwells with his awareness overcome by ill will sloth drowsiness restlessness anxiety uncertainty obsessed with uncertainty he does not discern the escape as it actually is present from uncertainty once it has arisen making that uncertainty the focal point he absorbs himself with it besorbs resorbs supersorbs himself with it he is absorbed dependent on earth liquid fire wind the sphere of the infinitude of space the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness the sphere of nothingness the sphere of neither perception nor non perception this world the next world whatever is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect that is how an unbroken colt of a man is absorbed and how is a thoroughbred absorbed an excellent thoroughbred horse tied to the feeding trough is not absorbed with the thought barley grain barley grain why is that because as he is tied to the feeding trough the thought occurs to him i wonder what task the trainer will have me do today what should i do in response tied to the feeding trough he is not absorbed with the thought barley grain barley grain the excellent thoroughbred horse regards the feel of the spur as a debt an imprisonment a loss a piece of bad luck in the same way an excellent thoroughbred of a man having gone to the wilderness to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling dwells with his awareness not overcome by sensual passion not obsessed with sensual passion he discerns the escape as it actually is present from sensual passion once it has arisen he dwells with his awareness not overcome by ill will sloth drowsiness restlessness anxiety uncertainty obsessed with uncertainty he discerns the escape as it actually is present from uncertainty once it has arisen he is absorbed dependent neither on earth liquid fire wind the sphere of the infinitude of space the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness the sphere of nothingness the sphere of neither perception nor non perception this world the next world nor on whatever is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after or pondered by the intellect and yet he is absorbed and to this excellent thoroughbred of a man absorbed in this way the gods together with homage to you o thoroughbred man homage to you o superlative man you of whom we don t know even what it is dependent on which you re absorbed when this was said ven sandha said to the blessed one but in what way lord is the excellent thoroughbred of a man absorbed when he is absorbed dependent neither on earth liquid heat wind the sphere of the infinitude of space the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness the sphere of nothingness the sphere of neither perception nor non perception this world the next world nor on whatever is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after or pondered by the intellect and yet he is absorbed so that to this excellent thoroughbred of a man absorbed in this way the gods together with indra the brahmas pajapati pay homage even from afar homage to you o thoroughbred man homage to you o superlative man you of whom we don t know even what it is dependent on which you re absorbed there is the case sandha where for an excellent thoroughbred of a man the perception absorbed in this way the excellent thoroughbred of a man is absorbed dependent neither on earth liquid fire wind the sphere of the infinitude of space the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness the sphere of nothingness the sphere of neither perception nor non perception this world the next world nor on whatever is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought

homage to you o thoroughbred man homage to you o superlative man you of whom we don t know even what it is dependent on which you re absorbed monks these four are ignoble searches which four there is the case where a person being subject himself to aging seeks happiness in what is subject to aging being subject himself to illness he seeks happiness in what is subject to illness being subject himself to death he seeks happiness in what is subject to death being subject himself to defilement he seeks happiness in what is subject to defilement these are four ignoble searches now these four are noble searches which four there is the case where a person being subject himself to aging realizing the drawbacks of what is subject to aging seeks the unaging unsurpassed rest from the yoke unbinding being subject himself to illness realizing the drawbacks of what is subject to illness he seeks the unailing unsurpassed rest from the yoke unbinding being subject himself to death realizing the drawbacks of what is subject to death he seeks the undying unsurpassed rest from the yoke unbinding being subject himself to defilement realizing the drawbacks of what is subject to defilement he seeks the undefiled unsurpassed rest from the yoke unbinding these are four noble searches there is on himavat king of mountains a rugged and uneven land where monkeys do not wander and nor do men and there is on himavat king of mountains a rugged and uneven land where monkeys do indeed wander but men do not and there is on himavat king of mountains a level stretch of ground quite pleasing where monkeys do wander and so do men there a hunter set a trap on the trails used by the monkeys in order to capture those monkeys there were monkeys there who were not of foolish nature not of greedy nature seeing that trap they stayed well away but there was one monkey of foolish nature of greedy nature he went up to that trap and grabbed it with his hand it got stuck there i ll free my hand he grabbed it with his other hand it got stuck there i ll free both hands he grabbed it with his foot it got stuck there i ll free both hands and a foot he grabbed it with his other foot it got stuck there i ll free both hands and both feet he grabbed it with his snout it got stuck there and now that monkey caught five ways lays himself down and howls fallen into trouble fallen into ruin for the hunter to do with as he pleases this is what happens to one who wanders in wrong pastures in the habitat of others therefore monks do not wander in wrong pastures in the habitat of others wandering in wrong pastures in the habitat of others mara will gain an access mara will gain a footing and what for a monk are wrong pastures the habitat of others the five strands of sense desire what are these five forms discerned with the eye appealing pleasurable yearned for and lusted after sounds discerned with the ear appealing pleasurable yearned for and lusted after odors discerned with the nose appealing pleasurable yearned for and lusted after flavors discerned with the tongue appealing pleasurable yearned for and lusted after touches discerned with the body appealing pleasurable yearned for and lusted after these for a monk are wrong pastures the habitat of others wander in right pastures in your own natural habitat wandering in right pastures in your own natural habitat mara will not gain an access mara will not gain a footing and what for a monk are right pastures your own natural habitat the four foundations of mindfulness what are these four here monks a monk abides observing body as body ardent mindful fully aware leading away unhappiness and worldly worries observing feelings as feeling ardent mindful fully aware leading away unhappiness and worldly worries observing mind as mind ardent mindful fully aware leading away unhappiness and worldly worries observing mental phenomena as mental phenomena ardent mindful fully aware leading away unhappiness and worldly worries these for a monk are right pastures your own natural habitat thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living on isigili mountain near do you monks see this yes bhante there was another name monks for this vebhara mountain another designation do you monks see this yes bhante there was another name monks for this pandava mountain another designation do you monks see this yes bhante there was another name monks for this vepulla mountain another designation do you monks see this yes bhante there was another name monks for this gijjhakuta mountain another designation do you monks see this isigili mountain yes bhante this has been the very name monks the very designation for this isigili mountain in the past monks five hundred i will tell you monks the names of the paccekabuddhas i will reveal monks the names of the paccekabuddhas listen pay close attention i will speak yes bhante replied the monks the blessed one said i the names of those supreme beingsii arittha uparittha tagarasikhi yasassi sudassana piyadassi the enlightened xii these and others are paccekabuddhas of great power whose desires for becoming re living are destroyed do salute these great sages of immeasurable virtue who have gone beyond all attachment thus i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living at benares in the deer park at isipatana the resort of seers there he addressed the bhikkhus of the group of five bhikkhus these two extremes ought not to be cultivated by one gone forth from the house life what are the two there is devotion to indulgence of pleasure in the objects of sensual desire which is inferior low vulgar ignoble and leads to no good and there is devotion to self torment which is painful ignoble and leads to no good the middle way discovered by a perfect one avoids both these extremes it gives vision it gives knowledge and it leads to peace to direct acquaintance to discovery to nibbana and what is that middle way it is simply the noble eightfold path that is to say right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration that is the middle way discovered by a perfect one which gives vision which gives knowledge and which leads to peace to direct acquaintance to discovery to nibbana suffering as a noble truth is this birth is suffering aging is suffering sickness is suffering death is suffering sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair are suffering association with the loathed is suffering dissociation from the loved is suffering not to get what one wants is suffering in short suffering is the five categories of clinging objects the origin of suffering as a noble truth is this it is the craving that produces renewal of being accompanied by enjoyment and lust and enjoying this and that in other words craving for sensual desires craving for being craving for non being cessation of suffering as a noble truth is this it is remainderless fading and ceasing giving up relinquishing letting go and rejecting of that same craving the way leading to cessation of suffering as a noble truth is this it is simply the noble eightfold path that is to say right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration suffering as a noble truth is this such was the vision the knowledge the understanding the finding the light that arose in regard to ideas not heard by me before this suffering as a noble truth can be diagnosed such was the vision the knowledge the understanding the finding the light that arose in regard to ideas not heard by me before this suffering as a noble truth has been diagnosed such was the vision the knowledge the understanding the finding the light that arose in regard to ideas not heard by me before the origin of suffering as a noble truth is this such was the vision this origin of suffering as a noble truth can be abandoned such was the vision this origin of suffering as a noble truth has been abandoned such was the vision in regard to ideas not heard by me before cessation of suffering as a noble truth is this such was the vision this cessation of suffering as a noble truth can be verified such was the vision this cessation of suffering as a noble truth has been verified such was the vision in regard to ideas not heard by me before the way leading to cessation of suffering as a noble truth is this such was the vision this way leading to cessation of suffering as a noble truth can be developed such was the vision this way leading to the cessation of suffering as a noble truth has been developed such was the vision in regard to ideas not heard by me before as long as my knowing and seeing how things are was not quite purified in these twelve aspects in these three phases of each of the four noble truths i did not claim in the world with its gods its maras and high divinities in this generation with its monks and brahmans with its princes and men to have discovered the full awakening that is supreme but as soon as my knowing and seeing how things are was quite purified in these twelve aspects in these three phases of each of the four noble truths then i claimed in the world with its gods its maras and high divinities in this generation with its monks and brahmans its princes and men to have discovered the full awakening that is supreme knowing and seeing arose in me thus my heart s deliverance is unassailable this is the last birth now there is no renewal of being that is what the blessed one said the bhikkhus of the group of five were glad and they approved his words now during this utterance there arose in the venerable konda a the spotless immaculate vision of the true idea whatever is subject to arising is all subject to cessation when the wheel of truth had thus been set rolling by the blessed one the earthgods raised the cry at benares in the deer park at isipatana the matchless wheel of truth has been set rolling by the blessed one not to be stopped by monk or divine or god or death angel or high divinity or anyone in the world on hearing the earth gods cry all the gods in turn in the six paradises of the sensual sphere took up the cry till it reached beyond the retinue of high divinity in the sphere of pure form and so indeed in that hour at that moment the cry soared up to the world of high divinity and this ten thousandfold world element shook and rocked and quaked and a great measureless radiance surpassing the very nature of the gods was displayed in the world then the blessed one uttered the exclamation konda a knows konda a knows and that is how that venerable one acquired the name a a konda a konda a who knows on one occasion the blessed one was staying near yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said once monks there was a king named yes your majesty i can the chariot maker replied to the king then in six months minus six days the chariot maker finished one wheel king pacetana said to him in six days time from now the battle will take place will the pair of chariot wheels be finished your majesty in these six months minus six days i have finished one wheel but can you finish the second wheel in these six days yes your majesty i can the chariot maker replied to the king then after finishing the second wheel in six days the chariot maker took the pair of wheels to the king and on arrival said to him here is your new pair of chariot wheels all finished your majesty and what is the difference between your wheel that took six months minus six days to finish and your wheel that took six days to finish i don t see any difference between them at all there is a difference between them your majesty look at the difference then the chariot maker took the chariot wheel finished in six days and set it rolling going as far as its momentum carried it it twirled around and around and fell to the ground but then he took the chariot wheel finished in six months minus six days and set it rolling going as far as its momentum carried it it stood still as if fixed on an axle now what is the reason my good chariot maker what is the cause why the chariot wheel finished in six days when set rolling goes as far as its momentum carries it and then twirling around and around falls to the ground and what is the reason what is the cause why the chariot wheel finished in six months minus six days when set rolling goes as far as its momentum carries it and then stands still as if fixed on an axle your majesty as for the wheel finished in six days its rim is crooked with faults flaws its spokes are crooked with faults flaws its hub is crooked with faults flaws because its rim spokes hub are crooked with faults flaws when set rolling it goes as far as its momentum carries it and then twirling around and around falls to the ground but as for the wheel finished in six months minus six days its rim is not crooked with no faults or flaws its spokes are not crooked with no faults or flaws its hub is not crooked with no faults or flaws because its rim spokes hub are not crooked with no faults or flaws when set rolling it goes as far as its momentum carries it and then stands still as if fixed on an axle now monks the thought may occur to you that the chariot maker on that occasion was someone else but it shouldn t be seen in that way i myself was the chariot maker on that occasion i was skilled in dealing with the crookedness the faults the flaws of wood now i am a worthy one rightly self awakened skilled in dealing with the crookedness faults flaws of bodily action skilled in dealing with the crookedness faults flaws of verbal action skilled in dealing with the crookedness faults flaws of mental action any monk or nun in whom the crookedness faults flaws of bodily action are not abandoned the crookedness faults flaws of verbal action are not abandoned the crookedness faults flaws of mental action are not abandoned has fallen away from this dhamma discipline just like the wheel finished in six days but any monk or nun in whom the crookedness faults flaws of bodily action are abandoned the crookedness faults flaws of verbal action are abandoned the crookedness faults flaws of mental action are abandoned stands firm in this dhamma discipline just like the wheel finished in six months minus six days thus you should train yourselves we will abandon crookedness faults flaws in bodily action we will abandon crookedness faults flaws in verbal action we will abandon crookedness faults flaws in mental action that s how you should train yourselves thus have i heard at one time the blessed one was staying at saavatthii then taayana son of the devas put forth strength and cut the stream at the source brahman so said taayana the devas son and so saying he passed with his right side to the blessed one in salutation and vanished there and then and when the night was past the blessed one addressed the bhikkhus bhikkhus learn taayana s verses learn them by heart taayana s verses are for your good they pertain to the fundamentals of the holy life monks these two people are hard to find in the world which two the one who is first to do a kindness and the one who is grateful for a kindness done and feels obligated to repay it these two people are hard to find in the world make an island for yourself make an island for yourself dwelling at as you say lord the monks responded to the blessed one the blessed one said and what is the origination of the world dependent on the eye forms there arises eye

as a rain cloud would settle the dust that s been raised by the wind so all conceptions come to rest when one sees clearly with wisdom staying at savatthi monks if someone were to give a gift of one hundred serving dishes of food in the morning one hundred at mid day and one hundred in the evening and another person were to develop a mind of good will even for the time it takes to pull on a cow s udder in the morning again at mid day and again in the evening this the second action would be more fruitful than that the first thus you should train yourselves our awareness release through good will will be cultivated developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated well undertaken that s how you should train yourselves that s the way it is great king that s the way it is those who engage in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct leave themselves unprotected even though a squadron of elephant troops might protect them a squadron of cavalry troops a squadron of chariot troops a squadron of infantry troops might protect them still they leave themselves unprotected why is that because that s an external protection not an internal one therefore they leave themselves unprotected but those who engage in good bodily conduct good verbal conduct good mental conduct have themselves protected even though neither a squadron of elephant troops a squadron of cavalry troops a squadron of chariot troops nor a squadron of infantry troops might protect them still they have themselves protected why is that because that s an internal protection not an external one therefore they have themselves protected that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further restraint last night monks a certain devata in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of jeta s grove came to me and on arrival bowed down to me and stood to one side as she was standing there she said to me these seven qualities lord lead to a monk s non decline which seven respect for the teacher respect for the dhamma respect for the sangha respect for training respect for concentration compliance that is what that devata said having said it she bowed down to me circled me three times and then disappeared right there when this was said ven sariputta said to the blessed one this lord is how i understand the detailed meaning of the blessed one s brief statement there is the case where a monk himself has respect for the teacher he speaks in praise of having respect for the teacher with regard to those other monks who don t have respect for the teacher he gets them to undertake respect for the teacher as for those other monks who do have respect for the teacher he at the proper times speaks in praise of them truly accurately there is the case where a monk himself has respect for the dhamma there is the case where a monk himself has respect for the sangha there is the case where a monk himself has respect for training there is the case where a monk himself has respect for concentration there is the case where a monk himself is compliant there is the case where a monk himself has admirable friends he speaks in praise of having admirable friends with regard to those other monks who don t have admirable friends he gets them to undertake admirable friendship as for those other monks who do have admirable friends he at the proper times speaks in praise of them truly accurately this lord is how i understand the detailed meaning of the blessed one s brief statement this is to be done by one skilled in aims who wants to break through to the state of peace be capable upright straightforward easy to instruct gentle not conceited content easy to support with few duties living lightly with peaceful faculties masterful modest no greed for supporters do not do the slightest thing that the wise would later censure think happy at rest may all beings be happy at heart whatever beings there may be weak or strong without exception long large middling short subtle blatant seen unseen near far born seeking birth may all beings be happy at heart let no one deceive another or despise anyone anywhere or through anger or irritation wish for another to suffer as a mother monks doctors give a purgative for warding off diseases caused by bile diseases caused by phlegm diseases caused by the internal wind property there is a purging there i don t say that there s not but it sometimes succeeds and sometimes fails so i will teach you the noble purgative that always succeeds and never fails a purgative whereby beings subject to birth are freed from birth beings subject to aging are freed from aging beings subject to death are freed from death beings subject to sorrow lamentation pain distress despair are freed from sorrow lamentation pain distress despair listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said now what is the noble purgative that always succeeds and never fails a purgative whereby beings subject to birth are freed from birth beings subject to aging are freed from aging beings subject to death are freed from death beings subject to sorrow lamentation pain distress despair are freed from sorrow lamentation pain distress despair in one who has right view wrong view is purged away and the many evil unskillful mental qualities that come into play in dependence on wrong view are purged away as well while the many skillful mental qualities that depend on right view go to the culmination of their development in one who has right resolve wrong resolve is purged away in one who has right speech wrong speech is purged away in one who has right action wrong action is purged away in one who has right livelihood wrong livelihood is purged away in one who has right effort wrong effort is purged away in one who has right mindfulness wrong mindfulness is purged away in one who has right concentration wrong concentration is purged away in one who has right knowledge wrong knowledge is purged away in one who has right release wrong release is purged away and the many evil unskillful mental qualities that come into play in dependence on wrong release are purged away as well while the many skillful mental qualities that depend on right release go to the culmination of their development this monks is the noble purgative that always succeeds and never fails a purgative whereby beings subject to birth are freed from birth beings subject to aging are freed from aging beings subject to death are freed from death beings subject to sorrow lamentation pain distress despair are freed from sorrow lamentation pain distress despair thus have i heard once the blessed one was staying at monks suppose a cloth were stained and dirty and a dyer dipped it in some dye or other whether blue or yellow or red or pink it would take the dye badly and be impure in color and why is that because the cloth was not clean so too monks when the mind is defiled monks suppose a cloth were clean and bright and a dyer dipped it in some dye or other whether blue or yellow or red or pink it would take the dye well and be pure in color and why is that because the cloth was clean so too monks when the mind is undefiled a happy destination in a future existence may be expected and what monks are the defilements of the mind knowing monks covetousness and unrighteous greed to be a defilement of the mind the monk abandons them when in the monk who thus knows that covetousness and unrighteous greed are a defilement of the mind this covetousness and unrighteous greed have been abandoned when in him who thus knows that ill will is a defilement of the mind this ill will has been abandoned when in him who thus knows that negligence is a defilement of the mind this negligence has been abandoned he thereupon gains unwavering confidence in the buddha he gains unwavering confidence in the dhamma thus well proclaimed by the blessed one is the dhamma realizable here and now possessed of immediate result bidding you come and see accessible and knowable individually by the wise he gains unwavering confidence in the sangha thus the sangha of the blessed one s disciples has entered on the good way has entered on the straight way has entered on the true way has entered on the proper way that is to say the four pairs of men the eight types of persons this sangha of the blessed one s disciples is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation the incomparable field of merit for the world when he has given up renounced let go abandoned and relinquished the defilements in part he knows i have given up renounced let go abandoned and relinquished the defilements in part and he gains enthusiasm for the goal gains enthusiasm for the dhamma gains gladness connected with the dhamma when he is gladdened joy is born in him being joyous in mind his body becomes tranquil when his body is tranquil he feels happiness and the mind of him who is happy becomes concentrated if monks a monk of such virtue such concentration and such wisdom just as cloth that is stained and dirty becomes clean and bright with the help of pure water or just as gold becomes clean and bright with the help of a furnace so too if a monk of such virtue such concentration and such wisdom eats almsfood consisting of choice hill rice together with various sauces and curries even that will be no obstacle for him he abides having suffused with a mind of loving kindness he abides having suffused with a mind of compassion of sympathetic joy of equanimity one direction of the world likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth and so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides suffusing the entire universe with equanimity with a mind grown great lofty boundless and free from enmity and ill will he understands what exists what is low what is excellent when he knows and sees now at that time the brahman what good brahman is the bahuka river what can the bahuka river do truly master gotama many people believe that the bahuka river gives purification many people believe that the bahuka river gives merit for in the bahuka river many people wash away the evil deeds they have done then the blessed one addressed the brahman sundarika bharadvaja in these stanzas bahuka and when this was said the brahman sundarika bharadvaja spoke thus i go to master gotama for refuge and to the dhamma and to the sangha may i receive the first ordination of going forth under master gotama may i receive the full admission and the venerable bharadvaja became one of the arahats adhikakka gayasundarikapayagasarassatibahumati monks suppose that this great earth were totally covered with water and a man were to toss a yoke with a single hole there a wind from the east would push it west a wind from the west would push it east a wind from the north would push it south a wind from the south would push it north and suppose a blind sea turtle were there it would come to the surface once every one hundred years now what do you think would that blind sea turtle coming to the surface once every one hundred years stick his neck into the yoke with a single hole it would be a sheer coincidence lord that the blind sea turtle coming to the surface once every one hundred years would stick his neck into the yoke with a single hole it s likewise a sheer coincidence that one obtains the human state it s likewise a sheer coincidence that a tathagata worthy rightly self awakened arises in the world it s likewise a sheer coincidence that a doctrine discipline expounded by a tathagata appears in the world now this human state has been obtained a tathagata worthy rightly self awakened has arisen in the world a doctrine discipline expounded by a tathagata appears in the world therefore your duty is the contemplation this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress your duty is the contemplation this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress at savatthi monks the eye is inconstant changeable alterable the ear the nose the tongue the body the mind is inconstant changeable alterable one who has conviction belief that these phenomena are this way is called a faith follower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the run of the mill he is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry shades he is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry one who after pondering with a modicum of discernment has accepted that these phenomena are this way is called a dhamma follower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the run of the mill he is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry shades he is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry one who knows and sees that these phenomena are this way is called a stream enterer steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for self awakening monks i will teach you the level of a person of no integrity and the level of a person of integrity listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said now what is the level of a person of no integrity a person of no integrity is ungrateful unthankful this ingratitude this lack of thankfulness is advocated by rude people it is entirely on the level of people of no integrity a person of integrity is grateful thankful this gratitude this thankfulness is advocated by civil people it is entirely on the level of people of integrity i traveled before in a single cloth with shaven head covered in dust thinking of faults in the faultless while in the faulty seeing no faults when done was the day s abiding i went to mount vulture peak and saw the stainless buddha by the order of bhikkhus revered then before him my hands in a jali humbly i bowed down on my knees come bhadda he said to me and thus was i ordained debt free i traveled for fifty years in anga magadha and vajji in kasi and kosala too living on the alms of the land that lay supporter wise man indeed may many merits accrue to him who gave a robe to bhadda for free of all ties is she days and nights go hurtling by till our lifetime comes to an end the life of mortals slips away like the water of tiny streams as she was standing to one side a devata recited this verse to the blessed one having killed what do you sleep in ease having killed what do you not grieve of the slaying of what one thing does gotama approve the buddha i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was living among the i too brahman plow sow having plowed sown i eat but contemplative i don t see the master gotama s yoke or plow plowshare goad or oxen and yet the master gotama says this i too brahman plow sow having plowed sown i eat then the kasi bharadvaja addressed the blessed one with a verse you claim to be a plowman but i don t see your plowing being asked tell us about your plowing so that we may know your plowing then kasi bharadvaja having heaped up milk rice in a large bronze serving bowl offered it to the blessed one saying may master gotama eat this milk rice the master is a plowman for the master gotama plows the plowing that has as its fruit the deathless what s been chanted over with verses shouldn t be eaten by me that s not the nature brahman of one who s seen rightly what s been chanted over with verses awakened ones reject that being their nature brahman this is their way of life serve with other food drink a fully perfected great seer his fermentations ended his anxiety stilled for that is the field for one looking for merit then to whom master gotama should i give this milk rice brahman i don t see that person in this world with its devas maras brahmas in this generation with its royalty common people by whom this milk rice having been eaten would be rightly digested aside from a tathagata or a tathagata s disciple in that case brahman throw the milk rice away in a place without vegetation or dump it in water with no living beings the buddha convictionat savatthi as he was sitting to one side wherever the mind feels confidence great king but a gift given where lord bears great fruit this question is one thing great king where should a gift be given while this a gift given where bears great fruit is something else entirely what is given to a virtuous person rather than to an unvirtuous one bears great fruit in that case great king i will ask you a counter question answer as you see fit no lord i wouldn t take him on i wouldn t have any use for a man like that then a brahman youth a merchant youth a laborer youth would come along untrained unpracticed undisciplined undrilled fearful terrified cowardly quick to flee would you take him on would you have any use for a man like that no lord i wouldn t take him on i wouldn t have any use for a man like that now what do you think great king there is the case where you have a war at hand a battle imminent a noble warrior youth would come along trained practiced disciplined drilled fearless unterrified not cowardly not quick to flee would you take him on would you have any use for a man like that yes lord i would take him on i would have use for a man like that then a brahman youth a merchant youth a laborer youth would come along trained practiced disciplined drilled fearless unterrified not cowardly not quick to flee would you take him on would you have any use for a man like that yes lord i would take him on i would have use for a man like that in the same way great king when someone has gone forth from the home life into homelessness no matter from what clan and he has abandoned five factors and is endowed with five what is given to him bears great fruit what is given to one who has abandoned five factors and is endowed with five factors in this way bears great fruit that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further as a king intent on battle would hire a youth in whom there are archery skills persistence strength and not on the basis of birth a coward so too you should honor a person of noble conduct wise in whom are established composure patience even though his birth may be lowly let donors build pleasant hermitages and there invite the learned to stay let them make reservoirs in dry forests and walking paths where it s rough let them with a clear calm awareness give food drink snacks clothing lodgings to those who ve become straightforward just asdwelling at then the thought occurred to me aging death exist when what exists from what as a requisite condition is there aging death from my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment

aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair all cease thus is the cessation of this entire mass of stress cessation cessation vision arose clear knowing arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before in the same way i saw an ancient path an ancient road traveled by the rightly self awakened ones of former times and what is that ancient path that ancient road traveled by the rightly self awakened ones of former times following it i came to direct knowledge of fabrications direct knowledge of the origination of fabrications direct knowledge of the cessation of fabrications direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of fabrications knowing that directly i have revealed it to monks nuns male lay followers female lay followers so that this holy life has become powerful rich detailed well populated wide spread proclaimed among celestial human beings who seeks to promote his welfare having glimpsed the state of perfect peace should be able honest and upright gentle in speech meek and not proud contented he ought to be easy to support not over busy and simple in living tranquil his senses let him be prudent and not brazen nor fawning on families also he must refrain from any action that gives the wise reason to reprove him then let him cultivate the thought may all be well and secure may all beings be happy whatever living creatures there be without exception weak or strong long huge or middle sized or short minute or bulky whether visible or invisible and those living far or near the born and those seeking birth may all beings be happy let none deceive or decry his fellow anywhere let none wish others harm in resentment or in hate just as with her own life a mother shields from hurt her own son her only child let all embracing thoughts for all beings be yours cultivate an all embracing mind of love for all throughout the universe in all its height depth and breadth love that is untroubled and beyond hatred or enmity as you stand walk sit or lie so long as you are awake pursue this awareness with your might it is deemed the divine state here holding no more to wrong beliefs with virtue and vision of the ultimate and having overcome all sensual desire never in a womb is one born again monks seven types of individuals are to be found existing in the world which seven there is the case where an individual sinks down once and stays sunk there is the case where an individual on coming to the surface sinks down again there is the case where an individual on coming to the surface stays there there is the case where an individual on coming to the surface opens his eyes looks around there is the case where an individual on coming to the surface heads across there is the case where an individual on coming to the surface gains a foothold then there is the case where an individual on coming to the surface crosses over reaches the far shore stands on high ground a brahman and how does an individual sink down once and stay sunk there is the case where an individual is endowed with exclusively dark unskillful qualities that s how an individual sinks down once and stays sunk and how does an individual on coming to the surface sink down again there is the case where an individual comes to the surface seeing conviction in skillful qualities is good conscience is good concern is good persistence is good discernment with regard to skillful qualities is good but his conviction neither remains nor grows but simply wanes away his conscience his concern his persistence his discernment neither remain nor grow but simply wane away that s how an individual on coming to the surface sinks down again and how does an individual on coming to the surface stay there there is the case where an individual comes to the surface seeing conviction in skillful qualities is good conscience is good concern and how does an individual on coming to the surface open his eyes look around there is the case where an individual comes to the surface seeing conviction in skillful qualities is good conscience is good concern is good persistence is good discernment with regard to skillful qualities is good with the total ending of the first three fetters he becomes a stream winner steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for self awakening that s how an individual on coming to the surface opens his eyes looks around and how does an individual on coming to the surface head across there is the case where an individual comes to the surface seeing conviction in skillful qualities is good conscience is good concern is good persistence is good discernment with regard to skillful qualities is good with the total ending of the first three fetters and with the attenuation of passion aversion delusion he becomes a once returner who on returning only one more time to this world will make an ending to stress that s how an individual on coming to the surface heads across and how does an individual on coming to the surface gain a foothold there is the case where an individual comes to the surface seeing conviction in skillful qualities is good conscience is good concern is good persistence is good discernment with regard to skillful qualities is good with the total ending of the five lower fetters he is due to be reborn in the pure abodes there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world that s how an individual on coming to the surface gains a foothold and how does an individual on coming to the surface cross over reach the far shore stand on high ground a brahman there is the case where an individual comes to the surface seeing conviction in skillful qualities is good conscience is good concern is good persistence is good discernment with regard to skillful qualities is good with the ending of the mental fermentations he enters remains in the fermentation free awareness release discernment release having directly known and realized them for himself right in the here now that s how an individual on coming to the surface crosses over reaches the far shore stands on high ground a brahman these are the seven types of individuals to be found existing in the world i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in then saccaka a nigantha jain while walking and wandering around to exercise his legs went to the gabled hall in the great forest ven ananda saw him coming from afar and on seeing him said to the blessed one venerable sir here comes saccaka the nigantha a debater a sophist well regarded by people at large he is intent on the disparagement of the buddha the disparagement of the dhamma the disparagement of the sangha it would be good if the blessed one would sit down for a moment out of sympathy for him so the blessed one sat down on a prepared seat then saccaka the nigantha went to the blessed one and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one there are master gotama some brahmans contemplatives who live committed to the development of the body but not to the development of the mind they are touched by bodily painful feeling it has happened in the past that when one of them was touched by bodily painful feeling his thighs would grow rigid his heart would burst hot blood would gush from his mouth he would go mad out of his mind his mind was thus subservient to his body and fell under the power of the body why was that a lack of development of the mind then there are some brahmans contemplatives who live committed to the development of the mind but not to the development of the body they are touched by mental painful feeling it has happened in the past that when one of them was touched by mental painful feeling his thighs would grow rigid his heart would burst hot blood would gush from his mouth he would go mad out of his mind his body was thus subservient to his mind and fell under the power of the mind why was that a lack of development of the body the thought has occurred to me that the disciples of gotama the contemplative live committed to the development of the mind but not to the development of the body but what have you learned aggivessana about the development of the body there are for example nanda vaccha kisa sankicca and makkhali gosala they are cloth less but aggivessana do they survive just on that no master gotama sometimes they eat outstanding staple foods chew on outstanding non staple foods taste outstanding delicacies and drink outstanding drinks they rescue the body its strength fortify it and fatten it what they earlier abandoned aggivessana they later gather up this is how there is decrease increase of the body but what have you learned aggivessana about the development of the mind yet saccaka the nigantha when asked by the blessed one about the development of the mind was unable to respond then the blessed one said to saccaka the ones you described just now as developed in the development of the body that is not legitimate development of the body in the discipline of the noble ones as you don t understand the development of the body from where would you understand the development of the mind nevertheless as to how one is undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mind and developed in body and developed in mind listen and pay close attention i will speak as you say master gotama saccaka responded the blessed one said and how is one undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mind there is the case where a pleasant feeling arises in an uneducated run of the mill person on being touched by the pleasant feeling he becomes impassioned with pleasure and is reduced to being impassioned with pleasure his pleasant feeling ceases with the cessation of the pleasant feeling there arises a painful feeling on being touched with the painful feeling he sorrows grieves laments beats his breast becomes distraught when that pleasant feeling had arisen in him it invaded his mind and remained because of his lack of development of the body when that painful feeling had arisen in him it invaded his mind and remained because of his lack of development of the mind this is how one is undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mind and how is one developed in body and developed in mind there is the case where a pleasant feeling arises in a well educated disciple of the noble ones on being touched by the pleasant feeling he doesn t become impassioned with pleasure and is not reduced to being impassioned with pleasure his pleasant feeling ceases with the cessation of the pleasant feeling there arises a painful feeling on being touched with the painful feeling he doesn t sorrow grieve or lament beat his breast or becomes distraught when that pleasant feeling had arisen in him it didn t invade his mind and remain because of his development of the body when that painful feeling had arisen in him it didn t invade his mind and remain because of his development of the mind this is how one is developed in body and developed in mind i have confidence in master gotama that master gotama is developed in body and developed in mind well aggivessana you are certainly being rude and presumptuously speaking your words but nevertheless i will respond to you but perhaps there has never arisen in master gotama the sort of pleasant feeling that having arisen would invade the mind and remain perhaps there has never arisen in master gotama the sort of painful feeling that having arisen would invade the mind and remain why wouldn t it have aggivessana before my awakening when i was still an unawakened bodhisatta the thought occurred to me so at a later time when i was still young black haired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life having shaved off my hair beard though my parents wished otherwise and were grieving with tears on their faces i put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness having gone forth in search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace i went to when this was said he replied to me you may stay here my friend this doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter dwell in his own teacher s knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledge it was not long before i quickly learned the doctrine as far as mere lip reciting repetition i could speak the words of knowledge the words of the elders and i could affirm that i knew saw i along with others i thought it isn t through mere conviction alone that alara kalama declares i have entered dwell in this dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge certainly he dwells knowing seeing this dhamma so i went to him and said to what extent do you declare that you have entered dwell in this dhamma when this was said he declared the dimension of nothingness i thought not only does alara kalama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment i too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment what if i were to endeavor to realize for myself the dhamma that alara kalama declares he has entered dwells in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge so it was not long before i quickly entered dwelled in that dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge i went to him and said friend kalama is this the extent to which you have entered dwell in this dhamma having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge yes my friend this friend is the extent to which i too have entered dwell in this dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge it is a gain for us my friend a great gain for us that we have such a companion in the holy life so the dhamma i declare i have entered dwell in having realized it for myself through direct knowledge is the dhamma you declare you have entered dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge and the dhamma you declare you have entered dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge is the dhamma i declare i have entered dwell in having realized it for myself through direct knowledge the dhamma i know is the dhamma you know the dhamma you know is the dhamma i know as i am so are you as you are so am i come friend let us now lead this community together in this way did alara kalama my teacher place me his pupil on the same level with himself and pay me great honor but the thought occurred to me this dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to awakening nor to unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of nothingness so dissatisfied with that dhamma i left in search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace i went to when this was said he replied to me you may stay here my friend this doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter dwell in his own teacher s knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledge it was not long before i quickly i thought it wasn t through mere conviction alone that rama declared i have entered dwell in this dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge certainly he dwelled knowing seeing this dhamma so i went to uddaka and said to what extent did rama declare that he had entered dwelled in this dhamma when this was said uddaka declared the dimension of neither perception nor non perception i thought not only did rama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment i too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment what if i were to endeavor to realize for myself the dhamma that rama declared he entered dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge so it was not long before i quickly entered dwelled in that dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge i went to uddaka and said friend uddaka is this the extent to which rama entered dwelled in this dhamma having realized it for himself through direct knowledge yes my friend this friend is the extent to which i too have entered dwell in this dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge it is a gain for us my friend a great gain for us that we have such a companion in the holy life so the dhamma rama declared he entered dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge is the dhamma you declare you have entered dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge and the dhamma you declare you have entered dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge is the dhamma rama declared he entered dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge the dhamma he knew is the dhamma you know the dhamma you know is the dhamma he knew as he was so are you as you are so was he come friend lead this community in this way did uddaka ramaputta my companion in the holy life place me in the position of teacher and pay me great honor but the thought occurred to me this dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to awakening nor to unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of neither perception nor non perception so dissatisfied with that dhamma i left in search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace i wandered by stages in the magadhan country and came to the military town of uruvela there i saw some delightful countryside with an inspiring forest grove a clear flowing river with fine delightful banks and villages for alms going on all sides the thought occurred to me how delightful is this countryside with its inspiring forest grove clear flowing river with fine delightful banks and villages for alms going on all sides this is just right for the striving of a clansman intent on striving so i sat down right there thinking this is just right for striving then these three similes spontaneous never before heard appeared to me no master gotama why is that because the timber is wet sappy and besides it is lying in the water eventually the man would reap only his share of weariness disappointment so it is with any brahman or contemplative who does not live withdrawn from sensuality in body mind and whose desire infatuation urge thirst fever for sensuality is not relinquished stilled within him whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving for awakening he is incapable of knowledge vision unexcelled self awakening this was the first simile spontaneous never before heard that appeared to me then a second simile spontaneous never before heard appeared to me suppose there were a wet sappy piece of timber lying on land far from water and a man were to come along with an upper fire stick thinking i ll light a fire i ll produce heat now what do you think would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper fire stick in the wet sappy timber lying on land far from water no master gotama why is that because the timber is wet sappy even though it is lying on land far from water eventually the man would reap only his share of weariness disappointment so it is with any brahman or contemplative who lives withdrawn from sensuality in body only but whose desire infatuation urge thirst fever for sensuality is not relinquished stilled within him whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is incapable of knowledge vision unexcelled self awakening this was the second simile spontaneous never before heard that appeared to me then a third simile spontaneous never before heard appeared to me suppose there were a dry sapless piece of timber lying on land far from water and a man were to come along with an upper fire stick thinking i ll light a fire i ll produce heat now what do you think would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper fire stick in the dry sapless timber lying on land yes master gotama why is that because the timber is dry sapless and besides it is lying on land far from water so it is with any brahman or contemplative who lives withdrawn from sensuality in body mind and whose desire infatuation urge thirst fever for sensuality is relinquished stilled within him whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is capable of knowledge vision unexcelled self awakening this was the third simile spontaneous never before heard that appeared to me i thought suppose that i clenching my teeth and pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth were to beat down constrain crush my mind with my awareness so clenching my teeth and pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth i beat down constrained crushed my mind with my awareness just as a strong man seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the shoulders would beat him down constrain crush him in the same way i beat down constrained crushed my mind with my awareness as i did so sweat poured from my armpits and although tireless persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established my body was aroused uncalm because of the painful exertion but the painful feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain i thought suppose i were to become absorbed in the trance of non breathing so i stopped the in breaths out breaths in my nose mouth as i did so there was a loud roaring of winds coming out my earholes devas on seeing me said gotama the contemplative is dead other devas said he isn t dead he s dying others said he s neither dead nor dying he s an arahant for this is the way arahants live i thought suppose i were to practice going altogether without food then devas came to me and said dear sir please don t practice going altogether without food if you go altogether without food we ll infuse divine nourishment in through your pores and you will survive on that i thought if i were to claim to be completely fasting while these devas are infusing divine nourishment in through my pores i would be lying so i dismissed them saying enough i thought suppose i were to take only a little food at a time only a handful at a time of bean soup lentil soup vetch soup or pea soup so i took only a little food at a time only a handful at a time of bean soup lentil soup vetch soup or pea soup my body became extremely emaciated simply from my eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems my backside became like a camel s hoof my spine stood out like a string of beads my ribs jutted out like the jutting rafters of an old run down barn the gleam of my eyes appeared to be sunk deep in my eye sockets like the gleam of water deep in a well my scalp shriveled withered like a green bitter gourd shriveled withered in the heat the wind the skin of my belly became so stuck to my spine that when i thought of touching my belly i grabbed hold of my spine as well and when i thought of touching my spine i grabbed hold of the skin of my belly as well if i urinated or defecated i fell over on my face right there simply from my eating so little if i tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands the hair rotted at its roots fell from my body as i rubbed simply from eating so little people on seeing me would say gotama the contemplative is black other people would say gotama the contemplative isn t black he s brown others would say gotama the contemplative is neither black nor brown he s golden skinned so much had the clear bright color of my skin deteriorated simply from eating so little i thought whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the past have felt painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmost none have been greater than this whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the future will feel painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmost none will be greater than this whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the present are feeling painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmost none is greater than this but with this racking practice of austerities i haven t attained any superior human state any distinction in knowledge or vision worthy of the noble ones could there be another path to awakening i thought i recall once when my father the sakyan was working and i was sitting in the cool shade of a rose apple tree then quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful mental qualities i entered remained in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought evaluation could that be the path to awakening then following on that memory came the realization that is the path to awakening i thought so why am i afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality nothing to do with unskillful mental qualities i thought i am no longer afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality nothing to do with unskillful mental qualities but that pleasure is not easy to achieve with a body so extremely emaciated suppose i were to take some solid food some rice porridge so i took some solid food some rice porridge now five monks had been attending on me thinking if gotama our contemplative achieves some higher state he will tell us but when they saw me taking some solid food some rice porridge they were disgusted and left me thinking gotama the contemplative is living luxuriously he has abandoned his exertion and is backsliding into abundance so when i had taken solid food and regained strength then quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful mental qualities i entered remained in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought evaluation but the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations i entered remained in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance but the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain with the fading of rapture i remained equanimous mindful alert and sensed pleasure with the body i entered remained in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding but the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress i entered remained in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain but the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain when the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady attained to imperturbability i directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past lives i recollected my manifold past lives i e one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction expansion there i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose there there too i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose here thus i remembered my manifold past lives in their modes details this was the first knowledge i attained in the first watch of the night ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose as happens in one who is heedful ardent resolute but the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain when the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady attained to imperturbability i directed it to the knowledge of the passing away reappearance of beings i saw by means of the divine eye purified surpassing the human beings passing away re appearing and i discerned how they are inferior superior beautiful ugly fortunate unfortunate in accordance with their kamma these beings who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell but these beings who were endowed with good conduct of body speech mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world thus by means of the divine eye purified surpassing the human i saw beings passing away re appearing and i discerned how they are inferior superior beautiful ugly fortunate unfortunate in accordance with their kamma this was the second knowledge i attained in the second watch of the night ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose as happens in one who is heedful ardent resolute but the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain when the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady attained to imperturbability i directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations i discerned as it was actually present that this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the way leading to the cessation of stress these are fermentations this is the origination of fermentations this is the cessation of fermentations this is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations my heart thus knowing thus seeing was released from the fermentation of sensuality released from the fermentation of becoming released from the fermentation of ignorance with release there was the knowledge released i discerned that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world this was the third knowledge i attained in the third watch of the night ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose as happens in one who is heedful ardent resolute but the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain i recall having taught the dhamma to an assembly of many hundreds and yet each one of them assumes of me gotama the contemplative is teaching the dhamma attacking just me but it shouldn t be seen in that way the tathagata rightly teaches them the dhamma simply for the purpose of giving knowledge at the end of that very talk i steady the mind inwardly settle it concentrate it and unify it in the same theme of concentration as before in which i almost constantly dwell that is credible for the master gotama as would be the case for one who is worthy rightly self awakened but does the master gotama recall sleeping during the day i recall aggivessana in the last month of the hot season after the meal returning from my almsround setting out my outer robe folded in four lying down on my right side and falling asleep while mindful alert there are some brahmans contemplatives master gotama who would call that dwelling in delusion it s not to that extent that one is deluded or undeluded aggivessana as to how one is deluded or undeluded listen and pay close attention i will speak as you say master gotama saccaka responded the blessed one said in whomever the fermentations that defile that lead to renewed becoming that give trouble that ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging death are not abandoned him i call deluded for it is from not abandoning the fermentations that one is deluded in whomever the fermentations that defile that lead to renewed becoming that give trouble that ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging death when this was said saccaka the nigantha said to the blessed one it s amazing master gotama it s astounding that when master gotama is addressed rudely again again is assailed by presumptuous courses of speech the color of his skin brightens the color of his face clears as would be the case with one who is worthy and rightly self awakened i recall engaging purana kassapa in debate he when engaged in debate by me spoke evasively and led the discussion astray displayed irritation aversion peevishness but when master gotama is addressed rudely again again is assailed by presumptuous courses of speech the color of his skin brightens the color of his face clears as would be the case with one who is worthy and rightly self awakened i recall engaging makkhali gosala ajita kesakambala pakudha kaccayana sa jaya velatthaputta nigantha nataputa in debate he when engaged in debate by me spoke evasively and led the discussion astray displayed irritation aversion peevishness but when master gotama is addressed rudely again again is assailed by presumptuous courses of speech the color of his skin brightens the color of his face clears as would be the case with one who is worthy and rightly self awakened and now master gotama i am going many are my duties many my responsibilities then do aggivessana what you think it is now time to do so saccaka the nigantha delighting in approving of the blessed one s words got up from his seat and left i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at the eastern monastery the palace of mig ra s mother just now lord i had some dealings with king pasenadi kosala that he did not settle as i had wished then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed all subjection to others is painful all independence is bliss what is held in common brings suffering for duties are hard to overcome at why is that from an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration a beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating wandering on long have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things enough to become dispassionate enough to be released furthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters remains in the second jhana the third jhana the fourth jhana the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor non perception and he knows it through discernment it is to this extent that one is described by the blessed one as released through discernment though with a sequel furthermore with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception he enters remains in the cessation of perception feeling and as he sees with discernment the mental fermentations go to their total end and he knows it through discernment it is to this extent that one is described by the blessed one as released through discernment without a sequel there are o monks these three feelings pleasant painful and neither painful nor pleasant pleasant feelings should be known as painful painful feelings should be known as a thorn and neither painful nor pleasant feelings should be known as impermanent if a monk has known the feelings in such a way it is said of him that he has the right outlook he has cut off craving severed the fetters to existence and through the full penetration of conceit he has made an end of suffering who sees the pain in happiness and views the painful feeling as a thorn perceives the transience in neutral feeling which is peaceful right outlook truly has such a monk who fully understands these feelings and having penetrated them he will be taint free in this very life mature in knowledge firm in dhamma s ways when once his life span ends his body breaks all measure and concept he has transcended at savatthi monks any desire passion with regard to the eye is a defilement of the mind any desire passion with regard to the ear the nose the tongue the body the intellect is a defilement of the mind when with regard to these six bases the defilements of awareness are abandoned then the mind is inclined to renunciation the mind fostered by renunciation feels malleable for the direct knowing of those qualities worth realizing i was drunk with the intoxication of my birth wealth sovereignty drunk with the intoxication of my body s build coloring form i wandered about regarding no one as my equal or better foolish arrogant haughty my banner held high i disrespectful arrogant proud bowed down to no one not even mother father or those commonly held in respect then seeing the ultimate leader supreme foremost of charioteers like a blazing sun arrayed with a squadron of monks casting away pride intoxication through an awareness serene clear i bowed down my head to him supreme among all living beings haughtiness contempt have been abandoned rooted out the conceit i am is extracted all forms of pride destroyed i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was wandering among the kosalans with a large community of monks and on that occasion a large number of youths passed by as if jeeringthen on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed false pundits totally muddled speaking in the range of mere words babbling as much as they like led on by what they don t know to the extent that there are animals footless two footed four footed many footed with form or formless percipient non percipient or neither percipient nor non percipient the tathagata worthy rightly self awakened is reckoned the foremost among them in the same way all skillful qualities are rooted in heedfulness converge in heedfulness and heedfulness is reckoned the foremost among them the world is assailed by death and smothered by old age pierced with the arrow of craving and always obscured by desires the world is assailed by death and besieged by old age eternally beaten with no relief like a thief beneath the rod old age illness and death approach like three great masses of fire no strength can resist them no speed can out run them spend your days without confusion whether few or many remain for every night that slips away there is that much less of life left whether walking or standing sitting or lying down your final night is drawing near you have no time to be lazy thus have i heard at one time the blessed one was staying near saavatthii at jeta grove in anaathapi n dika s park now a certain deva standing thus on one side the deva spoke this verse before the blessed one life but leads to doom our time is short from decay there s naught can keep us safe contemplating thus the fear of death let s make merit that will bring us bliss the blessed one replied the deva spoke this verse hard it is to keep and hard to bear recluse life for him who lacks the skill obstacles abound the fool is lost how long can he endure the holy life if he cannot hold his heart in check caught now here now there he stumbles falls the blessed one replied i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near then but how venerable sir will i refute the words of gotama the contemplative so mighty so powerful come now prince go to gotama the contemplative and on arrival say this lord would the tathagata say words that are unendearing disagreeable to others if gotama the contemplative thus asked answers the tathagata would say words that are unendearing disagreeable to others then you should say then how is there any difference between you lord and run of the mill people for even run of the mill people say words that are unendearing disagreeable to others but if gotama the contemplative thus asked answers the tathagata would not say words that are unendearing disagreeable to others then you should say then how lord did you say of responding as you say venerable sir prince abhaya got up from his seat bowed down to nigantha nataputta circumambulated him and then went to the blessed one on arrival he bowed down to the blessed one and sat to one side as he was sitting there he glanced up at the sun and thought today is not the time to refute the blessed one s words tomorrow in my own home i will overturn the blessed one s words so he said to the blessed one may the blessed one together with three others acquiesce to my offer of tomorrow s meal the blessed one acquiesced with silence then prince abhaya understanding the blessed one s acquiescence got up from his seat bowed down to the blessed one circumambulated him and left then after the night had passed the blessed one early in the morning put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe went to prince abhaya s home on arrival he sat down on a seat made ready prince abhaya with his own hand served satisfied the blessed one with fine staple non staple foods then when the blessed one had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl prince abhaya took a lower seat and sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one lord would the tathagata say words that are unendearing disagreeable to others prince there is no categorical yes or no answer to that then right here lord the niganthas are destroyed but prince why do you say then right here lord the niganthas are destroyed just yesterday lord i went to nigantha nataputta and he said to me come now prince go to gotama the contemplative and on arrival say this lord would the tathagata say words that are unendearing disagreeable to others just as if a two horned chestnut were stuck in a man s throat he would not be able to swallow it down or spit it up in the same way when gotama the contemplative is asked this two pronged question by you he won t be able to swallow it down or spit it up now at that time a baby boy was lying face up on the prince s lap so the blessed one said to the prince what do you think prince if this young boy through your own negligence or that of the nurse were to take a stick or a piece of gravel into its mouth what would you do i would take it out lord if i couldn t get it out right away then holding its head in my left hand and crooking a finger of my right i would take it out even if it meant drawing blood why is that because i have sympathy for the young boy in the same way prince in the case of words that the tathagata knows to be factual true unbeneficial unendearing disagreeable to others he does not say them in the case of words that the tathagata knows to be factual true beneficial but unendearing disagreeable to others he has a sense of the proper time for saying them in the case of words that the tathagata knows to be unfactual untrue unbeneficial but endearing agreeable to others he does not say them in the case of words that the tathagata knows to be factual true unbeneficial but endearing agreeable to others he does not say them in the case of words that the tathagata knows to be factual true beneficial and endearing agreeable to others he has a sense of the proper time for saying them why is that because the tathagata has sympathy for living beings lord when wise nobles or brahmans householders or contemplatives having formulated questions come to the tathagata and ask him does this line of reasoning appear to his awareness beforehand if those who approach me ask this i thus asked will answer in this way or does the tathagata come up with the answer on the spot in that case prince i will ask you a counter question answer as you see fit what do you think are you skilled in the parts of a chariot yes lord i am skilled in the parts of a chariot and what do you think when people come ask you what is the name of this part of the chariot does this line of reasoning appear to your awareness beforehand if those who approach me ask this i thus asked will answer in this way or do you come up with the answer on the spot lord i am renowned for being skilled in the parts of a chariot all the parts of a chariot are well known to me i come up with the answer on the spot in the same way prince when wise nobles or brahmans householders or contemplatives having formulated questions come to the tathagata and ask him he comes up with the answer on the spot why is that because the property of the dhamma is thoroughly penetrated by the tathagata from his thorough penetration of the property of the dhamma he comes up with the answer on the spot when this was said prince abhaya said to the blessed one what should be done by one skillful in good so as to gain the state of peace is this let him be able and upright and straight easy to speak to gentle and not proud contented too supported easily with few tasks and living very lightly his faculties serene prudent and modest unswayed by the emotions of the clans and let him never do the slightest thing that other wise men might hold blamable and let him think in safety and in bliss may creatures all be of a blissful heart whatever breathing beings there may be no matter whether they are frail or firm with none excepted be they long or big or middle sized or be they short or small or thick as well as those seen or unseen or whether they are dwelling far or near existing or yet seeking to exist may creatures all be of a blissful heart let no one work another one s undoing or even slight him at all anywhere and never let them wish each other ill through provocation or resentful thought and just as might a mother with her life protect the son that was her only child so let him then for every living thing maintain unbounded consciousness in being and let him too with love for all the world maintain unbounded consciousness in being above below and all round in between untroubled with no enemy or foe and while he stands or walks or while he sits or while he lies down free from drowsiness let him resolve upon this mindfulness this is divine abiding here they say but when he has no trafficking with views is virtuous and has perfected seeing and purges greed for sensual desires he surely comes no more to any womb monks there are these five types of warriors who can be found existing in the world which five there is the case of a warrior who on seeing a cloud of dust stirred up by the enemy army falters faints doesn t steel himself can t engage in the battle some warriors are like this this is the

existing among the monks then there s the case friend ananda where beings do not discern as it actually is present that this perception has a share in decline this perception has a share in stability this perception has a share in distinction this perception has a share in penetration and what friend sariputta is the cause what is the reason why some beings do become totally unbound in the present life there s the case friend ananda where beings discern as it actually is present that this perception has a share in decline this perception has a share in stability this perception has a share in distinction this perception has a share in penetration this is the cause this is the reason why some beings become totally unbound in the present life i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion the blessed one was instructing urging rousing encouraging the monks with dhamma talk concerned with unbinding the monks receptive attentive focusing their entire awareness lending ear listened to the dhamma then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed there is monks an unborn see also i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near then a large number of wandering sectarians went to ven anuradha and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies they sat to one side as they were sitting there they said to ven anuradha friend anuradha the tathagata the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment being described is described with one of these four positions the tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death when this was said ven anuradha said to the wandering sectarians friends the tathagata the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment being described is described otherwise than with these four positions the tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death when this was said the wandering sectarians said to ven anuradha this monk is either a newcomer not long gone forth or else an elder who is foolish inexperienced so the wandering sectarians addressing ven anuradha as they would a newcomer or a fool got up from their seats and left then not long after the wandering sectarians had left this thought occurred to ven anuradha if i am questioned again by those wandering sectarians how will i answer in such a way that will i speak in line with what the blessed one has said will not misrepresent the blessed one with what is unfactual will answer in line with the dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the dhamma will have grounds for criticizing me then ven anuradha went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to the blessed one sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one just now i was staying not far from the blessed one in a wilderness hut then a large number of wandering sectarians came and said to me friend anuradha the tathagata the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment being described is described with one of these four positions the tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death when this was said i said to them friends the tathagata the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment being described is described otherwise than with these four positions the tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death when this was said the wandering sectarians said to me this monk is either a newcomer not long gone forth or else an elder who is foolish inexperienced so addressing me as they would a newcomer or a fool they got up from their seats and left then not long after the wandering sectarians had left this thought occurred to me if i am questioned again by those wandering sectarians how will i answer in such a way that will i speak in line with what the blessed one has said will not misrepresent the blessed one with what is unfactual will answer in line with the dhamma and no one whose thinking is in line with the dhamma will have grounds for criticizing me what do you think anuradha is form constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it proper to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord is feeling constant or inconstant inconstant lord is perception constant or inconstant inconstant lord are fabrications constant or inconstant inconstant lord is consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it proper to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord what do you think anuradha do you regard form as the tathagata no lord do you regard feeling as the tathagata no lord do you regard perception as the tathagata no lord do you regard fabrications as the tathagata no lord do you regard consciousness as the tathagata no lord what do you think anuradha do you regard the tathagata as being in form elsewhere than form in feeling elsewhere than feeling in perception elsewhere than perception in fabrications elsewhere than fabrications in consciousness elsewhere than consciousness no lord what do you think do you regard the tathagata as form feeling perception fabrications consciousness no lord do you regard the tathagata as that which is without form without feeling without perception without fabrications without consciousness no lord and so anuradha when you can t pin down the tathagata as a truth or reality even in the present life is it proper for you to declare friends the tathagata the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment being described is described otherwise than with these four positions the tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death no lord very good anuradha very good i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery there ven mah moggall na addressed the monks friend monks yes friend the monks responded to him ven mah moggall na said friends once as i was withdrawn in seclusion this train of thought arose to my awareness noble silence noble silence it is said but what is noble silence then the thought occurred to me there is the case where a monk with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations then the blessed one coming to me through his psychic power said moggall na moggall na brahman don t be heedless of noble silence establish your mind in noble silence make your mind unified in noble silence concentrate your mind in noble silence so at a later time with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations i entered remained in the second jh na rapture pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance when one speaking rightly would say of someone a disciple attained to greatness of direct knowledge through the assistance of the teacher it s of me that one speaking rightly would say a disciple attained to greatness of direct knowledge through the assistance of the teacher i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near as you say lord the monks responded to him and no one approached the blessed one except for the one who brought almsfood then the monks thinking the blessed one with many lines of reasoning has given a talk on the unattractiveness of the body has spoken in praise of the perception of unattractiveness has spoken in praise of the development of the perception of unattractiveness remained committed to the development of the perception of unattractiveness in many modes manners they ashamed repelled disgusted with this body sought for an assassin in one day ten monks took the knife in one day twenty monks took the knife in one day thirty monks took the knife then the blessed one emerging from his seclusion after half a month s time said to because lord the blessed one with many lines of reasoning gave the monks a talk on the unattractiveness of the body spoke in praise of the perception of unattractiveness spoke in praise of the development of the perception of unattractiveness the monks thinking the blessed one with many lines of reasoning has given a talk on the unattractiveness of the body has spoken in praise of the perception of unattractiveness has spoken in praise of the development of the perception of unattractiveness remained committed to the development of the perception of unattractiveness in many modes manners they ashamed repelled disgusted with this body sought for an assassin in one day ten monks took the knife in one day twenty monks took the knife in one day thirty monks took the knife it would be good lord if the blessed one would explain another method so that this community of monks might be established in gnosis in that case ananda gather in the assembly hall all the monks who live in dependence on vesali as you say lord ven ananda responded when he had gathered in the assembly hall all the monks who lived in dependence on vesali he went to the blessed one and said the community of monks is gathered lord now is the time to do as the blessed one sees fit then the blessed one went to the assembly hall and sat down on a seat made ready as he was sitting there he addressed the monks monks this concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing when developed pursued is both peaceful exquisite a refreshing pleasant abiding that immediately disperses allays any evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen and how is concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing developed pursued so as to be both peaceful exquisite a refreshing pleasant abiding that immediately disperses allays any evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen there is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore always mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out breathing in long he discerns i am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns i am breathing out long or breathing in short he discerns i am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns i am breathing out short he trains himself i will breathe in sensitive to the entire body he trains himself i will breathe out sensitive to the entire body he trains himself i will breathe in calming bodily fabrication he trains himself i will breathe out calming bodily fabrication he trains himself i will breathe in sensitive to rapture he trains himself i will breathe out sensitive to rapture he trains himself i will breathe in sensitive to pleasure he trains himself i will breathe out sensitive to pleasure he trains himself i will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication feeling perception he trains himself i will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication he trains himself i will breathe in calming mental fabrication he trains himself i will breathe out calming mental fabrication he trains himself i will breathe in sensitive to the mind he trains himself i will breathe out sensitive to the mind he trains himself i will breathe in gladdening the mind he trains himself i will breathe out gladdening the mind he trains himself i will breathe in steadying the mind he trains himself i will breathe out steadying the mind he trains himself i will breathe in releasing the mind he trains himself i will breathe out releasing the mind he trains himself i will breathe in focusing on inconstancy he trains himself i will breathe out focusing on inconstancy he trains himself i will breathe in focusing on dispassion this is how concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing is developed pursued so as to be both peaceful exquisite a refreshing pleasant abiding that immediately disperses allays any evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen once a certain monk came to see the blessed one and after saluting him respectfully sat down at one side seated thus he spoke to the blessed one as follows when i went into seclusion while i was in solitude this thought occurred to me three feelings have been taught by the blessed one pleasant painful and neutral feelings but the blessed one has also said that whatever is felt is within suffering now with reference to what was it stated by the blessed one that whatever is felt is within suffering well spoken monk well spoken while three feelings have been taught by me the pleasant the painful and the neutral yet i have also said that whatever is felt is within suffering this however was stated by me with reference to the impermanence of all conditioned phenomena i have further taught monk the gradual cessation of conditioned phenomena in him who has attained the first meditative absorption i have further taught monk the gradual stilling of conditioned phenomena there are monk these six quietenings in him who has attained the first absorption speech is quietened having attained the second absorption thought conception and discursive thinking are quietened having attained the third absorption rapture is quietened having attained the fourth absorption inhalation and exhalation is quietened contents on one occasion the blessed one was staying near i tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappear it is amazing lord and awesome how well that has been said by the blessed one i tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappear once i was a seer named rohitassa a student of when this was said the blessed one responded it s not to be reached by traveling the end of the cosmos regardless and it s not without reaching the end of the cosmos that there is release from suffering stress so truly the wise one an expert with regard to the cosmos a knower of the end of the cosmos having fulfilled the holy life calmed knowing the cosmos end doesn t long for this cosmos or for any other i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in yes indeed friends i understand the dhamma taught by the blessed one and those acts the blessed one says are obstructive when indulged in are not genuine obstructions then those monks desiring to pry the monk arittha formerly of the vulture killers away from that pernicious viewpoint quizzed him back and forth and rebuked him saying don t say that friend arittha don t misrepresent the blessed one for it is not good to misrepresent the blessed one the blessed one would not say anything like that in many ways friend the blessed one has described obstructive acts and when indulged in they are genuine obstructions the blessed one has said that sensual pleasures are of little satisfaction much stress much despair greater drawbacks the blessed one has compared sensual pleasures to a chain of bones of much stress much despair greater drawbacks the blessed one has compared sensual pleasures to a lump of flesh a grass torch a pit of glowing embers a dream borrowed goods the fruits of a tree a butcher s ax and chopping block swords and spears a snake s head of much stress much despair greater drawbacks so when the monks were unable to pry the monk arittha formerly of the vulture killers away from that pernicious viewpoint they went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they told him what had happened so the blessed one told a certain monk come monk in my name call the monk arittha formerly of the vulture killers saying the teacher calls you friend arittha as you say lord the monk answered and having gone to the monk arittha formerly of the vulture killers on arrival he said the teacher calls you friend arittha as you say my friend the monk arittha formerly of the vulture killers replied then he went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him is it true arittha that this pernicious viewpoint has arisen in you as i understand the dhamma taught by the blessed one those acts the blessed one says are obstructive when indulged in are not genuine obstructions yes indeed lord i understand the dhamma taught by the blessed one and those acts the blessed one says are obstructive when indulged in are not genuine obstructions worthless man from whom have you understood that dhamma taught by me in such a way worthless man haven t i in many ways described obstructive acts and when indulged in they are genuine obstructions i have said that sensual pleasures are of little satisfaction much stress much despair greater drawbacks i have compared sensual pleasures to a chain of bones of much stress much despair greater drawbacks i have compared sensual pleasures to a lump of flesh a grass torch a pit of glowing embers a dream borrowed goods the fruits of a tree a butcher s ax and chopping block swords and spears a snake s head of much stress much despair greater drawbacks but you worthless man through your own wrong grasp of the dhamma have both misrepresented us as well as injuring yourself and accumulating much demerit for yourself for that will lead to your long term harm suffering then the blessed one said to the monks what do you think monks is this monk arittha formerly of the vulture killers even warm how could he be lord no lord when this was said the monk arittha formerly of the vulture killers sat silent abashed his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for words then the blessed one seeing that the monk arittha formerly of the vulture killers was sitting silent abashed his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for words said to him worthless man you will be recognized for your own pernicious viewpoint i will cross examine the monks on this matter then the blessed one addressed the monks monks do you too understand the dhamma as taught by me in the same way that the monk arittha formerly of the vulture killers does when through his own wrong grasp both misrepresents us as well as injuring himself and accumulating much demerit for himself no lord for in many ways the blessed one has described obstructive acts to us and when indulged in they are genuine obstructions the blessed one has said that sensual pleasures are of little satisfaction much stress much despair greater drawbacks the blessed one has compared sensual pleasures to a chain of bones of much stress much despair greater drawbacks the blessed one has compared sensual pleasures to a lump of flesh a grass torch a pit of glowing embers a dream borrowed goods the fruits of a tree a butcher s ax and chopping block swords and spears a snake s head of much stress much despair greater drawbacks it s good monks that you understand the dhamma taught by me in this way for in many ways i have described obstructive acts to you and when indulged in they are genuine obstructions i have said that sensual pleasures are of little satisfaction much stress much despair greater drawbacks i have compared sensual pleasures to a chain of bones of much stress much despair greater drawbacks i have compared sensual pleasures to a lump of flesh a grass torch a pit of glowing embers a dream borrowed goods the fruits of a tree a butcher s ax and chopping block swords and spears a snake s head of much stress much despair greater drawbacks but this monk arittha formerly of the vulture killers through his own wrong grasp of the dhamma has both misrepresented us as well as injuring himself and accumulating much demerit for himself and that will lead to this worthless man s long term harm suffering for a person to indulge in sensual pleasures without sensual passion without sensual perception without sensual thinking that isn t possible monks there is the case where some worthless men study the dhamma dialogues narratives of mixed prose and verse explanations verses spontaneous exclamations quotations birth stories amazing events question answer sessions the earliest classifications of the buddha s teachings having studied the dhamma they don t ascertain the meaning or the purpose of those dhammas suppose there were a man needing a water snake seeking a water snake wandering in search of a water snake he would see a large water snake and grasp it by the coils or by the tail the water snake turning around would bite him on the hand on the arm or on one of his limbs and from that cause he would suffer death or death like suffering why is that because of the wrong graspedness of the water snake in the same way there is the case where some worthless men study the dhamma having studied the dhamma they don t ascertain the meaning of those dhammas with their discernment not having ascertained the meaning of those dhammas with their discernment they don t come to an agreement through pondering they study the dhamma both for attacking others and for defending themselves in debate they don t reach the goal for which people study the dhamma their wrong grasp of those dhammas will lead to their long term harm suffering why is that because of the wrong graspedness of the dhammas but then there is the case where some clansmen study the dhamma having studied the dhamma they ascertain the meaning of those dhammas with their discernment having ascertained the meaning of those dhammas with their discernment they come to an agreement through pondering they don t study the dhamma either for attacking others or for defending themselves in debate they reach the goal for which people study the dhamma their right grasp of those dhammas will lead to their long term welfare happiness why is that because of the right graspedness of the dhammas suppose there were a man needing a water snake seeking a water snake wandering in search of a water snake he would see a large water snake and pin it down firmly with a cleft stick having pinned it down firmly with a forked stick he would grasp it firmly by the neck then no matter how much the water snake might wrap its coils around his hand his arm or any of his limbs he would not from that cause suffer death or death like suffering why is that because of the right graspedness of the water snake in the same way there is the case where some clansmen study the dhamma having studied the dhamma they ascertain the meaning of those dhammas with their discernment having ascertained the meaning of those dhammas with their discernment they come to an agreement through pondering they don t study the dhamma either for attacking others or for defending themselves in debate they reach the goal for which people study the dhamma their right grasp of those dhammas will lead to their long term welfare happiness why is that because of the right graspedness of the dhammas therefore monks when you understand the meaning of any statement of mine that is how you should remember it but when you don t understand the meaning of any statement of mine then right there you should cross question me or the experienced monks monks i will teach you the dhamma compared to a raft for the purpose of crossing over not for the purpose of holding onto listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded to the blessed one the blessed one said suppose a man were traveling along a path he would see a great expanse of water with the near shore dubious risky the further shore secure free from risk but with neither a ferryboat nor a bridge going from this shore to the other the thought would occur to him here is this great expanse of water with the near shore dubious risky the further shore secure free from risk but with neither a ferryboat nor a bridge going from this shore to the other what if i were to gather grass twigs branches leaves and having bound them together to make a raft were to cross over to safety on the other shore in dependence on the raft making an effort with my hands feet then the man having gathered grass twigs branches leaves having bound them together to make a raft would cross over to safety on the other shore in dependence on the raft making an effort with his hands feet no lord and what should the man do in order to be doing what should be done with the raft there is the case where the man having crossed over would think how useful this raft has been to me for it was in dependence on this raft that making an effort with my hands feet i have crossed over to safety on the further shore why don t i having dragged it on dry land or sinking it in the water go wherever i like in doing this he would be doing what should be done with the raft in the same way monks i have taught the dhamma compared to a raft for the purpose of crossing over not for the purpose of holding onto understanding the dhamma as taught compared to a raft you should let go even of dhammas to say nothing of non dhammas monks there are these six view positions he assumes about feeling this is me this is my self this is what i am he assumes about perception this is me this is my self this is what i am he assumes about fabrications this is me this is my self this is what i am he assumes about what seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect this is me this is my self this is what i am he assumes about the view position this cosmos is the self then there is the case where a well instructed disciple of the noble ones who has regard for noble ones is well versed disciplined in their dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is well versed disciplined in their dhamma assumes about form this is not me this is not my self this is not what i am he assumes about feeling this is not me this is not my self this is not what i am he assumes about perception this is not me this is not my self this is not what i am he assumes about fabrications this is not me this is not my self this is not what i am he assumes about what seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect this is not me this is not my self this is not what i am he assumes about the view position this cosmos is the self after death this i will be constant permanent eternal not subject to change i will stay just like that for an eternity this is not me this is not my self this is not what i am seeing thus he is not agitated over what is not present when this was said a certain monk said to the blessed one lord might there be agitation over what is externally not present there might monk the blessed one said there is the case where someone thinks o it was mine o what was mine is not o may it be mine o i don t obtain it he grieves is tormented weeps beats his breast grows delirious it s thus that there is agitation over what is externally not present but lord might there be non agitation over what is externally not present there might monk the blessed one said there is the case where someone doesn t think o it was mine o what was mine is not o may it be mine o i don t obtain it he doesn t grieve isn t tormented doesn t weep beat his breast or grow delirious it s thus that there is non agitation over what is externally not present agitation non agitation but lord might there be agitation over what is internally not present there might monk the blessed one said there is the case where someone has this view this cosmos is the self after death this i will be constant permanent eternal not subject to change i will stay just like that for an eternity he hears a tathagata or a tathagata s disciple teaching the dhamma for the elimination of all view positions determinations biases inclinations obsessions for the stilling of all fabrications for the relinquishing of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation unbinding the thought occurs to him so it might be that i will be annihilated so it might be that i will perish so it might be that i will not exist he grieves is tormented weeps beats his breast grows delirious it s thus that there is agitation over what is internally not present but lord might there be non agitation over what is internally not present there might monk the blessed one said there is the case where someone doesn t have this view this cosmos is the self after death this i will be constant permanent eternal not subject to change i will stay just like that for an eternity he hears a tathagata or a tathagata s disciple teaching the dhamma for the elimination of all view positions determinations biases inclinations obsessions for the stilling of all fabrications for the relinquishing of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation unbinding the thought doesn t occur to him so it might be that i will be annihilated so it might be that i will perish so it might be that i will not exist he doesn t grieve isn t tormented doesn t weep beat his breast or grow delirious it s thus that there is non agitation over what is internally not present abandoning possessions views monks you would do well to possess that possession the possession of which would be constant permanent eternal not subject to change that would stay just like that for an eternity but do you see that possession the possession of which would be constant permanent eternal not subject to change that would stay just like that for an eternity no lord very good monks i too do not envision a possession the possession of which would be constant permanent eternal not subject to change that would stay just like that for an eternity monks you would do well to cling to that clinging to a doctrine of self clinging to which there would not arise sorrow lamentation pain grief despair but do you see a clinging to a doctrine of self clinging to which there would not arise sorrow lamentation pain grief despair no lord very good monks i too do not envision a clinging to a doctrine of self clinging to which there would not arise sorrow lamentation pain grief despair monks you would do well to depend on a view dependency no lord very good monks i too do not envision a view dependency depending on which there would not arise sorrow lamentation pain grief despair monks where there is a self would there be the thought belonging to my self yes lord or monks where there is what belongs to self would there be the thought my self yes lord monks where a self or what belongs to self are not pinned down as a truth or reality then the view position this cosmos is the self after death this i will be constant permanent eternal not subject to change i will stay just like that for an eternity isn t it utterly completely a fool s teaching what else could it be lord it s utterly completely a fool s teaching what do you think monks is form constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord is feeling constant or inconstant inconstant lord is perception constant or inconstant inconstant lord are fabrications constant or inconstant inconstant lord what do you think monks is consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord thus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am any feeling whatsoever any perception whatsoever any fabrications whatsoever any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness disenchanted he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is fully released with full release there is the knowledge fully released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world this monks is called a monk whose cross bar is thrown off and how is a monk one whose cross bar is thrown off there is the case where a monk s ignorance is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising this is how a monk is one whose cross bar is thrown off and how is a monk one whose moat is filled in there is the case where a monk s wandering on to birth leading on to further becoming is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising this is how a monk is one whose moat is filled in and how is a monk one whose pillar is pulled out there is the case where a monk s craving is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising this is how a monk is one whose pillar is pulled out and how is a monk one whose bolt is withdrawn there is the case where a monk s five lower fetters are abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising this is how a monk is one whose bolt is withdrawn and how is a monk a noble one with banner lowered burden placed down unfettered there is the case where a monk s conceit i am is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising this is how a monk is a noble one with banner lowered burden placed down unfettered and when the devas together with speaking in this way teaching in this way i have been erroneously vainly falsely unfactually misrepresented by some brahmans and contemplatives who say gotama the contemplative is one who misleads he declares the annihilation destruction extermination of the existing being but as i am not that as i do not say that so i have been erroneously vainly falsely unfactually misrepresented by those venerable brahmans and contemplatives who say gotama the contemplative is one who misleads he declares the annihilation destruction extermination of the existing being therefore monks if others insult abuse taunt bother harass you as well you should feel no hatred no resentment no dissatisfaction of heart because of that and if others honor respect revere venerate you as well you should feel no joy no gladness no elation of heart because of that and if others honor respect revere venerate you you should think they do us therefore monks whatever isn t yours let go of it your letting go of it will be for your long term welfare happiness and what isn t yours form body isn t yours let go of it your letting go of it will be for your long term welfare happiness feeling isn t yours perception thought fabrications consciousness isn t yours let go of it your letting go of it will be for your long term welfare happiness what do you think monks if a person were to gather or burn or do as he likes with the grass twigs branches leaves here in jeta s grove would the thought occur to you it s us that this person is gathering burning or doing with as he likes no lord why is that because those things are not our self nor do they belong to our self even so monks whatever isn t yours let go of it your letting go of it will be for your long term welfare happiness and what isn t yours form isn t yours feeling isn t yours perception thought fabrications consciousness isn t yours let go of it your letting go of it will be for your long term welfare happiness the well proclaimed dhamma the dhamma thus well proclaimed by me is clear open evident stripped of rags in the dhamma thus well proclaimed by me clear open evident stripped of rags there is for those monks who are arahants whose mental effluents are ended who have reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who are released through right gnosis no future cycle for manifestation this is how the dhamma well proclaimed by me is clear open evident stripped of rags in the dhamma thus well proclaimed by me clear open evident stripped of rags those monks who have abandoned the five lower fetters are all due to be reborn in the pure abodes there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world this is how the dhamma well proclaimed by me is clear open evident stripped of rags in the dhamma thus well proclaimed by me clear open evident stripped of rags those monks who have abandoned the three fetters with the attenuation of passion aversion delusion are all once returners who on returning only one more time to this world will make an ending to stress this is how the dhamma well proclaimed by me is clear open evident stripped of rags in the dhamma thus well proclaimed by me clear open evident stripped of rags those monks who have abandoned the three fetters are all stream winners steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for self awakening this is how the dhamma well proclaimed by me is clear open evident stripped of rags in the dhamma thus well proclaimed by me clear open evident stripped of rags those monks who are dhamma followers and conviction followers in the dhamma thus well proclaimed by me clear open evident stripped of rags those monks who have a sufficient measure of conviction in me a sufficient measure of love for me are all headed for heaven this is how the dhamma well proclaimed by me is clear open evident stripped of rags that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words on one occasion the blessed one was wandering on a tour among the kosalans with a large community of monks as he was going along a road he saw a large sala forest in a certain place going down from the road he went to the sala forest in this spot ananda there was once a great city powerful prosperous populous crowded with people and on that city then the thought occurred to gavesin the lay follower i am the benefactor of these lay followers their leader the one who has inspired them but i don t practice in full in terms of my virtue just as they don t practice in full in terms of their virtue in that we re exactly even there s nothing extra for me how about something extra so he went to the lay followers and on arrival said to them from today onward i want you to know me as someone who practices in full in terms of my virtue then the thought occurred to the lay followers master gavesin is our benefactor our leader the one who has inspired us he will now practice in full in terms of his virtue so why shouldn t we so they went to gavesin the lay follower and on arrival said to him from today onward we want master gavesin to know the lay followers as people who practice in full in terms of their virtue then the thought occurred to gavesin the lay follower

chaste life the life apart abstaining from intercourse the act of villagers then the thought occurred to the lay followers master gavesin is our benefactor our leader the one who has inspired us he will now practice the chaste life the life apart abstaining from intercourse the act of villagers so why shouldn t we so they went to gavesin the lay follower and on arrival said to him from today

one meal a day refraining in the night abstaining from a meal at the wrong time then the thought occurred to the lay followers master gavesin is our benefactor our leader the one who has inspired us he will now eat only one meal a day refraining in the night abstaining from a meal at the wrong time so why shouldn t we so they went to gavesin the lay follower and on arrival said to him from today onward we want master gavesin to know the lay followers as people who eat only one meal a day refraining in the night abstaining from a meal at the wrong time then the thought occurred to gavesin the lay follower i am the benefactor of these lay followers their leader the one who has inspired them i practice in full in terms of my virtue just as they practice in full in terms of their virtue i practice the chaste life the life apart abstaining from intercourse the act of villagers just as they practice the chaste life the life apart abstaining from intercourse the act of villagers i eat only one meal a day refraining in the night abstaining from a meal at the wrong time just as they eat only one meal a day refraining in the night abstaining from a meal at the wrong time in that we re exactly even there s nothing extra for me how about something extra then the thought occurred to the lay followers master gavesin is our benefactor our leader the one who has inspired us having shaven off his hair beard having put on the ochre robe he has gone forth from the home life into homelessness so why shouldn t we so they went to kassapa the blessed one worthy fully self awakened and on arrival said to him lord may we receive the going forth in the blessed one s presence may we receive the full acceptance so they received the going forth in the presence of kassapa the blessed one worthy fully self awakened they received the full acceptance then the thought occurred to gavesin the monk i obtain at will without difficulty without hardship this unexcelled bliss of release o that these monks may obtain at will without difficulty without hardship this unexcelled bliss of release then those monks dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent resolute in no long time reached remained in the supreme goal of the chaste life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing realizing it for themselves in the here now they knew birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for the sake of this world and thus did those monks headed by gavesin striving at what is more more excellent more more refined realize unexcelled release so ananda you should train yourselves striving at what is more more excellent more more refined we will realize unexcelled release that s how you should train yourselves on one occasion the blessed one was staying near yes young man i have slept in ease of those in the world who sleep in ease i am one but cold lord is the winter night the between the eights in that case young man i will question you in return answer as you see fit now what do you think suppose a householder or householder s son has a house with a gabled roof plastered inside out draft free with close fitting door windows shut against the wind inside he has a horse hair couch spread with a long fleeced coverlet a white wool coverlet an embroidered coverlet a rug of kadali deer hide with a canopy above red cushions on either side and there a lamp would be burning and his four wives with their many charms would be attending to him would he sleep in ease or not or how does this strike you yes lord he would sleep in ease of those in the world who sleep in ease he would be one but what do you think young man might there arise in that householder or householder s son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of passion so that burned with those passion born fevers he would sleep miserably yes lord as for those passion born fevers burned with which the householder or householder s son would sleep miserably that passion has been abandoned by the tathagata its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising therefore he sleeps in ease now what do you think young man might there arise in that householder or householder s son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of aversion so that burned with those aversion born fevers he would sleep miserably yes lord as for those aversion born fevers burned with which the householder or householder s son would sleep miserably that aversion has been abandoned by the tathagata its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising therefore he sleeps in ease now what do you think young man might there arise in that householder or householder s son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of delusion so that burned with those delusion born fevers he would sleep miserably yes lord as for those delusion born fevers burned with which the householder or householder s son would sleep miserably that delusion has been abandoned by the tathagata its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising therefore he sleeps in ease always always he sleeps in ease the brahman totally unbound who doesn t adhere to sensual pleasures who s without acquisitions cooled having cut all ties subdued fear in the heart calmed he sleeps in ease having reached peace of awareness on one occasion ven godatta was living near venerable sir there is a line of reasoning by which these phenomena are different in meaning and different in name and there is a line of reasoning by which they are one in meaning and different only in name and what is the line of reasoning by which they are different in meaning and different in name there is the case where a monk keeps pervading the first direction the east with an awareness imbued with good will likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth thus above below all around everywhere in its entirety he keeps pervading the all encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with good will abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without ill will he keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with compassion appreciation equanimity likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth thus above below all around everywhere in its entirety he keeps pervading the all encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with equanimity abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without ill will this is called the immeasurable awareness release and what is the nothingness awareness release there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness perceiving there is nothing enters remains in the dimension of nothingness this is called the nothingness awareness release and what is the emptiness awareness release there is the case where a monk having gone into the wilderness to the root of a tree or into an empty dwelling considers this this is empty of self or of anything pertaining to self and what is the themeless awareness release there is the case where a monk not attending to any theme this venerable sir is the line of reasoning by which these phenomena are different in meaning and different in name and what venerable sir is the line of reasoning by which they are one in meaning and different only in name passion venerable sir is a making of measurement aversion a making of measurement delusion a making of measurement passion is a something aversion a something delusion a something for a monk whose fermentations are ended these have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising to the extent that there are nothingness awareness releases the unprovoked awareness release is declared supreme and that unprovoked awareness release is empty of passion empty of aversion empty of delusion passion is a making of themes aversion a making of themes delusion a making of themes for a monk whose fermentations are ended these have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising to the extent that there are themeless awareness releases the unprovoked awareness release is declared supreme and that unprovoked awareness release is empty of passion empty of aversion empty of delusion this venerable sir is the line of reasoning by which these phenomena are one in meaning and different only in name it s a gain for you householder a great gain what your eye of discernment plumbs in the deep word of the buddha unindicated and unknown is the length of life of those subject to death life is difficult and brief and bound up with suffering there is no means by which those who are born will not die having reached old age there is death this is the natural course for a living being with ripe fruits there is the constant danger that they will fall in the same way for those born and subject to death there is always the fear of dying the young and old the foolish and the wise all are stopped short by the power of death all finally end in death of those overcome by death and passing to another world a father cannot hold back his son nor relatives a relation see while the relatives are looking on and weeping one by one each mortal is led away in this manner the world is afflicted by death and decay but the wise do not grieve having realized the nature of the world you do not know the path by which they came or departed not seeing either end you lament in vain if any benefit is gained by lamenting the wise would do it only a fool would harm himself yet through weeping and sorrowing the mind does not become calm but still more suffering is produced the body is harmed and one becomes lean and pale one merely hurts oneself one cannot protect a departed one by not abandoning sorrow a being simply undergoes more suffering bewailing the dead he comes under the sway of sorrow see other men faring according to their deeds hence beings tremble here with fear when they come into the power of death whatever they imagine it turns out quite different from that this is the sort of disappointment that exists look at the nature of the world if a man lives for a hundred years or even more finally he is separated from his circle of relatives and gives up his life in the end therefore having listened to the arahant with the arrow withdrawn unattached he would attain to peace of mind and when all sorrow has been transcended he is sorrow free and has realized nibbana thus i have heard at one time the lord was staying near it is possible brahman to lay down a gradual training a gradual doing a gradual practice in respect of this morality come you monk be of moral habit live controlled by the control of the obligations endowed with right behavior and posture seeing peril in the slightest fault and undertaking them train yourself in the rules of training as soon brahman as the monk is of moral habit controlled by the control of the obligations endowed with right behavior and posture seeing peril in the slightest fault and undertaking them trains himself in the rules of training the tathagata disciplines him further saying sense control come you monk be guarded as to the doors of the sense organs having seen a material shape with the eye do not be entranced with the general appearance do not be entranced with the detail for if one dwells with the organ of sight uncontrolled covetousness and dejection evil unskillful states of mind may flow in so fare along controlling it guard the organ of sight achieve control over the organ of sight having heard a sound with the ear having smelt a smell with the nose having savored a taste with the tongue having felt a touch with the body having cognized a mental state with the mind do not be entranced with the detail for if one dwells with the organ of mind uncontrolled covetousness and dejection evil unskillful states of mind may flow in so fare along controlling it guard the organ of mind achieve control over the organ of mind moderation in eating as soon brahman as a monk is guarded as to the doors of the sense organs the tathagata disciplines him further saying come you monk be moderate in eating you should take food reflecting carefully not for fun or indulgence or personal charm or beautification but taking just enough for maintaining this body and keeping it going for keeping it unharmed for furthering the brahma faring vigilance as soon brahman as a monk is moderate in eating the tathagata disciplines him further saying come you monk dwell intent on vigilance during the day while pacing up and down while sitting down cleanse the mind of obstructive mental states during the middle watch of the night lie down on the right side in the lion posture foot resting on foot mindful clearly conscious reflecting on the thought of getting up again during the last watch of the night when you have arisen while pacing up and down while sitting down cleanse the mind of obstructive mental states mindfulness and clear consciousness as soon brahman as a monk is intent on vigilance the tathagata disciplines him further saying come you monk be possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousness acting with clear consciousness whether you are approaching or departing acting with clear consciousness whether you are looking ahead or looking round acting with clear consciousness whether you are bending in or stretching out the arms acting with clear consciousness whether you are carrying the outer cloak the bowl or robe acting with clear consciousness whether you are eating drinking munching savoring acting with clear consciousness whether you are obeying the calls of nature acting with clear consciousness whether you are walking standing sitting asleep awake talking or being silent overcoming of the five hindrances as soon brahman as he is possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousness the tathagata disciplines him further saying come you monk choose a remote lodging in a forest at the root of a tree on a mountain slope in a glen a hill cave a cemetery a woodland grove in the open or on a heap of straw on returning from alms gathering after the meal the monk sits down crosslegged holding the back erect having made mindfulness rise up in front of him he getting rid of covetousness for the world dwells with a mind devoid of covetousness he cleanses the mind of covetousness getting rid of the taint of ill will he dwells benevolent in mind compassionate and merciful towards all creatures and beings he cleanses the mind of ill will getting rid of sloth and torpor he dwells without sloth or torpor perceiving the light mindful and clearly conscious he cleanses the mind of sloth and torpor getting rid of restlessness and worry he dwells calmly the mind inward tranquil he cleanses the mind of restlessness and worry getting rid of doubt he dwells doubt crossed unperplexed as to the states that are skilled jhana he by getting rid of these five hindrances brahman such is my instruction for those monks who are learners who perfection being not yet attained dwell longing for the incomparable security from the bonds but as for those monks who are perfected ones the cankers destroyed who have lived the life done what was to be done shed the burden attained to their own goal the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed and who are freed by perfect profound knowledge these things conduce both to their abiding in ease here and now as well as to their mindfulness and clear consciousness when this had been said the brahman ganaka moggallana spoke thus to the lord now on being exhorted thus and instructed thus by the good gotama do all the good gotama s disciples attain the unchanging goal some of my disciples brahman on being exhorted and instructed thus by me attain the unchanging goal nibbana some do not attain it what is the cause good gotama what the reason that since nibbana does exist since the way leading to nibbana exists since the good gotama exists as adviser some of the good gotama s disciples on being exhorted thus and instructed thus by the good gotama attain the unchanging goal nibbana but some do not attain it well then brahman i will question you on this point in reply as it is pleasing to you so you may answer me what do you think about this brahman are you skilled in the way leading to rajagaha yes sir skilled am i in the way leading to rajagaha what do you think about this a man might come along here wanting to go to rajagaha having approached you he might speak thus i want to go to rajagaha sir show me the way to this rajagaha you might speak thus to him yes my good man this road goes to rajagaha go along it for a while when you have gone along it for a while you will see a village go along for a while when you have gone along for a while you will see a market town go for a while when you have gone along for a while you will see rajagaha with its delightful parks delightful forests delightful fields delightful ponds but although he has been exhorted and instructed thus by you he might take the wrong road and go westwards then a second man might come along wanting to go to rajagaha what can i good gotama do in this matter a shower of the way good gotama am i when this had been said the brahman ganaka moggallana spoke thus to the lord good gotama as for those persons who in want of a way of living having gone forth from home into homelessness without faith who are crafty fraudulent deceitful who are unbalanced and puffed up who are shifty scurrilous and of loose talk the doors of whose sense organs are not guarded who do not know moderation in eating who are not intent on vigilance indifferent to recluseship not of keen respect for the training who are ones for abundance lax taking the lead in backsliding shirking the burden of seclusion who are indolent of feeble energy of confused mindfulness not clearly conscious not concentrated but of wandering minds who are weak in wisdom drivelers the good gotama is not in communion with monks uneducated run of the mill people describe three things as mother child separating dangers which three there comes a time when a great fire conflagration breaks out when a great fire conflagration breaks out it burns villages towns cities when it is burning villages towns cities a mother there can t get to her child and the child can t get to its mother this is the first thing that uneducated run of the mill people describe as a mother child separating danger then again there comes a time when a great cloud arises when a great cloud arises a great flood of water is produced when a great flood of water is produced it floods villages towns cities when it is flooding villages towns cities a mother there can t get to her child and the child can t get to its mother this is the second thing that uneducated run of the mill people describe as a mother child separating danger then again there comes a time when there is danger and an invasion of savage tribes taking power they surround the countryside when this happens a mother there can t get to her child and the child can t get to its mother this is the third thing that uneducated run of the mill people describe as a mother child separating danger these are the three things that uneducated run of the mill people describe as mother child separating dangers but there are these three things that are mother child uniting dangers yet run of the mill people describe them as mother child separating dangers which three there comes a time when a great fire conflagration breaks out when a great fire conflagration breaks out it burns villages towns cities when it is burning villages towns cities there are times when it so happens that a mother can get to her child and the child can get to its mother this is the first thing that is a mother child uniting danger yet run of the mill people describe it as a mother child separating danger then again there comes a time when a great cloud arises when a great cloud arises a great flood of water is produced when a great flood of water is produced it floods villages towns cities when it is flooding villages towns cities there are times when it so happens that a mother can get to her child and the child can get to its mother this is the second thing that is a mother child uniting danger yet run of the mill people describe it as a mother child separating danger then again there comes a time when there is danger and an invasion of savage tribes taking power they surround the countryside when this happens there are times when it so happens that a mother can get to her child and the child can get to its mother this is the third thing that is a mother child uniting danger yet run of the mill people describe it as a mother child separating danger these are the three things that are mother child uniting dangers yet run of the mill people describe them as mother child separating dangers there are these three things that are genuine mother child separating dangers which three the danger of aging the danger of illness the danger of death a mother can t get her wish with regard to her child who is aging i am aging but may my child not age a child can t get its wish with regard to its mother who is aging i am aging but may my mother not age a mother can t get her wish with regard to her child who is growing ill i am growing ill but may my child not grow ill a child can t get its wish with regard to its mother who is growing ill i am growing ill but may my mother not grow ill a mother can t get her wish with regard to her child who is dying i am dying but may my child not die a child can t get its wish with regard to its mother who is dying i am dying but may my mother not die these are the three things that are genuine mother child separating dangers there is a path there is a practice that leads to the abandoning and overcoming of these three mother child uniting dangers and these three mother child separating dangers and which is that path which is that practice just this very noble eightfold path i e right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration this is the path this the practice that leads to the abandoning and overcoming of these three mother child uniting dangers and these three mother child separating dangers in a lowly family i was born poor with next to no food my work was degrading i gathered the spoiled the withered flowers from shrines and threw them away people found me disgusting despised me disparaged me lowering my heart i showed reverence to many then i saw the one self awakened arrayed with a squadron of monks the great hero entering the city supreme of the magadhans throwing down my carrying pole i approached him to do reverence he the supreme man stood still out of sympathy just for me after paying homage to the feet of the teacher i stood to one side requested the going forth from him supreme among all living beings the compassionate teacher sympathetic to all the world said come monk that was my formal acceptance alone i stayed in the wilds untiring i followed the teacher s words just as he the conqueror had taught me in the first watch of the night i recollected previous lives in the middle watch purified the divine eye in the last burst the mass of darkness then as night was ending the sun returning indrabrahmaseeing me strung with garlands of flowering vines this patch of earth delights the mind the lovely calls of elephants sound these rocky crags do please me so the shimmering hue of darkening clouds cool waters in pure streams flowing enveloped by indra s ladybugs these rocky crags do please me so like the lofty peaks of looming clouds like the most refined of palaces the lovely calls of tuskers sound these rocky crags do please me so the lovely ground is rained upon the hills are full of holy seers resounding with the cry of peacocks these rocky crags do please me so being clothed in flaxen flowers as the sky is covered in clouds strewn with flocks of various birds these rocky crags do please me so not occupied by village folk but visited by herds of deer strewn with flocks of various birds these rocky crags do please me so with clear waters and broad boulders holding troops of monkey and deer covered with moist carpets of moss these rocky crags do please me so but there is not so much contentment for me in the five fold music as in truly seeing dhamma with a well concentrated mind i ask the kinsman of the sun the great seer about seclusion the state of peace seeing in what way is a monk unbound clinging to nothing in the world he should put an entire stop to the root of objectification classifications i am the thinker as inmine with plows the fields are plowed with seed the earth is sown thus wives and children feed so young men win their wealth then why do i of virtue pure doing the master s teaching not lazy nor proud nibbana not attain having washed my feet then i watched that water noticing the foot water flowing from high to low with that the mind was calmed just as a noble thoroughbred horse having taken my lamp i went into my hut inspected the sleeping place then sat upon the couch having taken a pin i pushed the wick right down and just as the lamp went out so all delusion of the heart went too the buddha admonished me bhadravudha the buddha sick putrid unclean look nanda at this physical heap through contemplation of the foul develop your mind make it one well centered as this your body so that as that so this it gives off a foul stench the delight of fools considering it thus untiring both day night i with my own discernment dissecting it saw and as i heedful examined it aptly this what do you want in the woods my boy like a bird i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near but even this view of yours even if this view of mine were pleasing to me master gotama it would still be the same it would still be the same well aggivessana there are more than many in the world who say it would still be the same it would still be the same yet they both do not abandon that view and they cling to another view there are fewer than few in the world who say it would still be the same it would still be the same and they both abandon that view and do not cling to another view there are some brahmans contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that all is pleasing to me there are some brahmans contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that all is not pleasing to me there are some brahmans contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that a part is pleasing to me a part is not pleasing to me with regard to those brahmans contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that all is pleasing to me that view of theirs is close to being impassioned close to bondage close to delighting close to holding close to clinging with regard to those brahmans contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that all is not pleasing to me that view of theirs is close to not being impassioned close to non bondage close to not delighting close to not holding close to not clinging when this was said longnails the wanderer said to the blessed one master gotama commends my viewpoint master gotama recommends my viewpoint with regard to those brahmans contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that a part is pleasing to me a part is not pleasing to me whatever is pleasing to them their view is close to being impassioned close to bondage close to delighting close to holding close to clinging whatever is not pleasing to them their view is close to not being impassioned close to non bondage close to not delighting close to not holding close to not clinging with regard to those brahmans contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion all is pleasing to me a wise person among them considers that if i were to grasp and insist firmly on this view of mine that all is pleasing to me and to state that only this is true all else is worthless i would clash with two the brahman or contemplative who is of the view of the opinion that all is not pleasing to me and the brahman or contemplative who is of the view of the opinion that a part is pleasing to me a part is not pleasing to me i would clash with these two where there is a clash there is dispute where there is a dispute quarreling where there is quarreling annoyance where there is annoyance frustration envisioning for himself clash dispute quarreling annoyance frustration he both abandons that view and does not cling to another view thus there is the abandoning of these views thus there is the relinquishing of these views with regard to those brahmans contemplatives who are of the view of the opinion that all is not pleasing to me a wise person among them considers that if i were to grasp and insist firmly on this view of mine that all is not pleasing to me and to state that only this is true all else is worthless i would clash with two the brahman or contemplative who is of the view of the opinion that all is pleasing to me and the brahman or contemplative who is of the view of the opinion that a part is pleasing to me a part is not pleasing to me i would clash with these two where there is a clash there is dispute where there is a dispute quarreling where there is quarreling annoyance where there is annoyance frustration envisioning for himself clash dispute quarreling annoyance frustration he both abandons that view and does not cling to another view thus there is the abandoning of these views thus there is the relinquishing of these views with regard to those brahmans contemplatives who are of the view of the

quarreling where there is quarreling annoyance where there is annoyance frustration envisioning for himself clash dispute quarreling annoyance frustration he both abandons that view and does not cling to another view thus there is the abandoning of these views thus there is the relinquishing of these views now aggivessana this body endowed with form composed of the four primary elements born from mother father nourished with rice porridge subject to inconstancy rubbing pressing dissolution and dispersion should be envisioned as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness not self in one who envisions the body as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness not self any desire for the body attraction to the body following after the body is abandoned there are these three kinds of feeling a pleasant feeling a painful feeling and neither pleasant nor painful feeling on the occasion when one feels a pleasant feeling one does not feel either a painful feeling or a neither pleasant nor painful feeling one feels only a pleasant feeling on that occasion on the occasion when one feels a painful feeling one does not feel either a pleasant feeling or a neither pleasant nor painful feeling one feels only a painful feeling on that occasion on the occasion when one feels a neither pleasant nor painful feeling one does not feel either a pleasant feeling or a painful feeling one feels only a neither pleasant nor painful feeling on that occasion a pleasant feeling is inconstant fabricated dependently co arisen subject to ending subject to vanishing fading ceasing a painful feeling is also inconstant fabricated dependently co arisen subject to ending subject to vanishing fading ceasing a neither pleasant nor painful feeling is also inconstant fabricated dependently co arisen subject to ending subject to vanishing fading ceasing seeing this an instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with pleasant feeling disenchanted with painful feeling disenchanted with neither pleasant nor painful feeling disenchanted he grows dispassionate from dispassion he is released with release there is the knowledge released he discerns birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world a monk whose mind is thus released does not take sides with anyone does not dispute with anyone he words things by means of what is said in the world but without grasping at it now at that time ven sariputta was sitting there is the case where a monk develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire the fabrications of exertion thinking this desire of mine will be neither overly sluggish nor overly active neither inwardly restricted nor outwardly scattered he keeps perceiving what is in front behind so that what is in front is the same as what is behind what is behind is the same as what is in front what is below is the same as what is above what is above is the same as what is below he dwells by night as by day and by day as by night by means of an awareness thus open unhampered he develops a brightened mind he develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on persistence he develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on intent he develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on discrimination the fabrications of exertion thinking this discrimination of mine will be neither overly sluggish nor overly active neither inwardly restricted nor outwardly scattered he keeps perceiving what is in front behind so that what is in front is the same as what is behind what is behind is the same as what is in front what is below is the same as what is above what is above is the same as what is below he dwells by night as by day and by day as by night by means of an awareness thus open unhampered he develops a brightened mind and how is desire overly sluggish whatever desire is accompanied by laziness conjoined with laziness that is called overly sluggish desire and how is desire overly active whatever desire is accompanied by restlessness conjoined with restlessness that is called overly active desire and how is desire inwardly restricted whatever desire is accompanied by sloth drowsiness conjoined with sloth drowsiness that is called inwardly restricted desire and how is desire outwardly scattered whatever desire is stirred up by the five strings of sensuality outwardly dispersed dissipated that is called outwardly scattered desire and how does a monk dwell perceiving what is in front behind so that what is in front is the same as what is behind and what is behind is the same as what is in front there is the case where a monk s perception of what is in front behind is well in hand well attended to well considered well tuned and how does a monk dwell so that what is below is the same as what is above and what is above is the same as what is below there is the case where a monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up from the crown of the head on down surrounded by skin full of various kinds of unclean things in this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small intestines gorge feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears skin oil saliva mucus fluid in the joints urine this is how a monk dwells so that what is below is the same as what is above and what is above is the same as what is below and how does a monk dwell by night as by day and by day as by night there is the case where a monk at night develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire the fabrications of exertion by means of the same modes and how does a monk by means of an awareness open unhampered develop a brightened mind there is the case where a monk has the perception of light the perception of daytime at any hour of the day well in hand well established this is how a monk by means of an awareness open unhampered develops a brightened mind when a monk has thus developed pursued the four bases of power he experiences manifold supranormal powers having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one he appears he vanishes he goes unimpeded through walls ramparts mountains as if through space he dives in out of the earth as if it were water he walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land sitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged bird with his hand he touches strokes even the sun moon so mighty powerful he exercises influence with his body even as far as the brahma worlds he hears by means of the divine ear element purified surpassing the human both kinds of sounds divine human whether near or far he knows the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with his own awareness he discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passion he discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion he discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion he discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind and a scattered mind as a scattered mind he discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mind he discerns an excelled mind one that is not at the most excellent level as an excelled mind and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind he discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind he discerns a released mind as a released mind and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind he recollects his manifold past lives he sees by means of the divine eye purified surpassing the human beings passing away and re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior superior beautiful ugly fortunate unfortunate in accordance with their kamma these beings who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell but these beings who were endowed with good conduct of body speech mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world thus by means of the divine eye purified surpassing the human he sees beings passing away and re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior superior beautiful ugly fortunate unfortunate in accordance with their kamma through the ending of the mental effluents he remains in the effluent free awareness release discernment release knowing realizing it for himself in the here now this is how these four bases of power when developed pursued are of great fruit great benefit how very happily we live how very happily we live how very happily we live once when this was said ven sariputta said to ven upasena but we don t see any alteration in your body or change in your faculties then ven upasena said quick friends lift this body of mine onto a couch and carry it outside before it is scattered like a fistful of chaff friend sariputta in anyone who had the thought i am the eye or the eye is mine i am the ear or the ear is mine i am the nose or the nose is mine i am the tongue or the tongue is mine i am the body or the body is mine i am the intellect or the intellect is mine in him there would be an alteration in his body or a change in his faculties but as for me the thought does not occur to me that i am the eye or the eye is mine i am the tongue or the tongue is mine i am the intellect or the intellect is mine so what alteration should there be in my body what change should there be in my faculties now ven upasena s i making my making obsession with conceit had already been well rooted out for a long time which is why the thought did not occur to him that i am the eye or the eye is mine i am the tongue or the tongue is mine i am the intellect or the intellect is mine then the monks lifted ven upasena s body on a couch and carried it outside and ven upasena s body was scattered right there like a fistful of chaff thus have i heard at one time the lord was staying at uruvela for seven days experiencing the bliss of liberation then at the end of those seven days the lord emerged from that concentration and gave well reasoned attention during the middle watch of the night to dependent arising in reverse order thus then on realizing its significance the lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance when things become manifest to the ardent meditating brahman all his doubts then vanish since he has known the utter destruction of conditions whether walking standing sitting or lying down it flexes stretches this is the body s movement joined together with tendons bones plastered over with muscle skin hidden by complexion the body isn t seen for what it is filled with intestines filled with stomach with the lump of the liver bladder lungs heart kidneys spleen mucus sweat saliva fat blood synovial fluid bile oil on top of that in nine streams four times five i ran amok from my dwelling having gained no peace of awareness my thoughts out of control so i went to a trustworthy nun she taught me the dhamma aggregates sense spheres elements hearing the dhamma i did as she said for seven days i sat in one spot absorbed in rapture bliss on the eighth i stretched out my legs having burst the mass of darkness he who can curb his wrath as soon as it arises as a timely antidote will check snake s venom

monks responded to him ven sariputta said all those who ask questions of another do so from any one of five motivations which five one asks a question of another through stupidity bewilderment one asks a question of another through evil desires overwhelmed with greed one asks a question of another through contempt one asks a question of another when desiring knowledge or one asks a question with this thought all those who ask questions of another do so from any one of these five motivations and as for me when i ask a question of another it s with this thought if when asked he answers correctly well good if not then i will answer correctly for him thus have i heard at one time the lord was staying at uruvela beside the river nera jara at the foot of the mucalinda tree having just realized full enlightenment at that time the lord sat cross legged for seven days experiencing the bliss of liberation now it happened that there occurred out of season a great rainstorm and for seven days there were rain clouds cold winds and unsettled weather then mucalinda the naga king left his dwelling place and having encircled the lord s body seven times with his coils he stood with his great hood spread over the lord s head thinking to protect the lord from cold and heat from gadflies mosquitoes wind sun and the touch of creeping things at the end of those seven days the lord emerged from that concentration then mucalinda the naga king seeing that the sky had cleared and the rain clouds had gone removed his coils from the lord s body changing his own appearance and assuming the appearance of a youth he stood in front of the lord with his hands folded together venerating him then on realizing its significance the lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance blissful is detachment for one who is content for one who has learned dhamma and who sees blissful is non affliction in the world restraint towards living creatures hearing these awesome hair raising words the young men threw down their weapons said what have you done sir or who have you taken as mentor because of whose teachings is this lack of sorrow acquired the bandit chief ven adhimutta in one bhikkhus seven things gratifying and helpful to an enemy befall one who is angry whether a woman or a man what are the seven here bhikkhus an enemy wishes thus for his enemy let him be ugly why is that no enemy relishes an enemy s beauty now when this person is angry a prey to anger ruled by anger be he ever so well bathed and well anointed with hair and beard trimmed and clothed in white yet he is ugly through his being a prey to anger this is the first thing gratifying and helpful to an enemy that befalls one who is angry whether a woman or a man also an enemy wishes thus for his enemy let him lie in pain why is that no enemy relishes an enemy s lying in comfort now when this person is angry a prey to anger ruled by anger for all he may lie on a couch spread with rugs blankets and counterpanes with a deerskin cover a canopy and red cushions for the head and feet yet he lies only in pain through his being a prey to anger this is the second thing gratifying to an enemy that befalls one who is angry whether a woman or a man also an enemy wishes thus for his enemy let him have no prosperity why is that no enemy relishes an enemy s prosperity now when this person is angry prey to anger ruled by anger he mistakes bad for good and he mistakes good for bad and each being taken wrongly in the other s sense these things for long conduce to his harm and suffering through his being a prey to anger this is the third thing gratifying and helpful to an enemy that befalls one who is angry whether a woman or a man also an enemy wishes thus for his enemy let him not be rich why is that no enemy relishes an enemy s having riches now when a person is angry a prey to anger should he have riches gained by endeavor built up by the strength of his arm earned by sweat lawful and lawfully acquired yet the king s treasury gathers in fines through his being a prey to anger this is the fourth thing gratifying and helpful to an enemy that befalls one who is a prey to anger whether a woman or a man also an enemy wishes thus for his enemy let him not be famous why is that no enemy relishes an enemy s having fame now when a person is angry a prey to anger ruled by anger what fame he may have acquired by diligence he loses through his being a prey to anger this is the fifth thing gratifying and helpful to an enemy that befalls one who is a prey to anger whether a woman or a man also an enemy wishes thus for his enemy let him have no friends why is that no enemy relishes and enemy s having friends now when this person is angry a prey to anger ruled by anger the friends he may have his companions relatives and kin will keep away from him through his being a prey to anger this is the sixth thing gratifying and helpful to an enemy that befalls one who is a prey to anger whether a woman or a man also an enemy wishes thus for his enemy let him on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a state of deprivation in a bad destination in perdition even in hell why is that no enemy relishes an enemy s going to a good destination now when this person is angry a prey to anger ruled by anger he misconducts himself in body speech and mind and by his misconduct in body speech and mind on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a state of deprivation in a bad destination in perdition even in hell through his being a prey to anger this is the seventh thing gratifying and helpful to an enemy that befalls one who is angry whether a woman or a man when anger does possess a man he looks ugly he lies in pain what benefit he may come by he misconstrues as a mischance he loses property through fines because he has been working harm through acts of body and speech by angry passion overwhelmed the wrath and rage that madden him gain him a name of ill repute his fellows relatives and kin will seek to shun him from afar and anger fathers misery this fury does so cloud the mind of man that he cannot discern this fearful inner danger an angry man no meaning knows no angry man sees the dhamma so wrapped in darkness as if blind is he whom anger dogs someone a man in anger hurts but when his anger is later spent with difficulty or with ease he suffers as if seared by fire his look betrays the sulkiness of some dim smoky smoldering glow whence may flare up an anger blaze that sets the world of men aflame he has no shame or conscience curb no kindly words come forth from him there is no island refuge for the man whom anger dogs such acts as will ensure remorse such as are far from the true dhamma it is of these that i would tell so harken to my words anger makes man a parricide anger makes him a matricide anger can make him slay the saint as he would kill the common man nursed and reared by a mother s care he comes to look upon the world yet the common man in anger kills the being who gave him life no being but seeks his own self s good none dearer to him than himself yet men in anger kill themselves distraught for reasons manifold for crazed they stab themselves with daggers in desperation swallow poison perish hanged by ropes or fling themselves over a precipice yet how their life destroying acts bring death unto themselves as well that they cannot discern and that is the ruin anger breeds this secret place with anger s aid is where mortality sets the snare to blot it out with discipline with vision strength and understanding to blot each fault out one by one the wise man should apply himself training likewise in the true dhamma let smoldering be far from us then rid of wrath and free from anger and rid of lust and free from envy tamed and with anger left behind taintless they reach nibbana setting at savatthi then in the morning the bhikkhuni soma dressed and taking bowl and robe entered savatthi for alms when she had walked for alms in savatthi and had returned from her alms round after her meal she went to the blind men s grove for the day s abiding having plunged into the blind men s grove she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day s abiding then mara the evil one desiring to arouse fear trepidation and terror in the bhikkhuni soma desiring to make her fall away from concentration approached her and addressed her in verse that state so hard to achieve which is to be attained by the seers can t be attained by a woman with her two fingered wisdom then it occurred to the bhikkhuni soma now who is this that recited the verse a human being or a non human being then it occurred to her this is mara the evil one who has recited the verse desiring to arouse fear trepidation and terror in me desiring to make me fall away from concentration then the bhikkhuni soma having understood this is mara the evil one replied to him in verses what does womanhood matter at all when the mind is concentrated well when knowledge flows on steadily as one sees correctly into dhamma one to whom it might occur i m a woman or i m a man or i m anything at all is fit for mara to address then mara the evil one realizing the bhikkhuni soma knows me sad and disappointed disappeared right there i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near savatthi in jeta s grove anathapindika s monastery there he addressed the monks monks yes lord the monks responded to him monks i will teach you the dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end i will expound the holy life both in its particulars in its essence entirely complete surpassingly pure in other words the six sextets listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said the six internal media should be known the six external media should be known the six classes of consciousness should be known the six classes of contact

with the eye disenchanted with forms disenchanted with consciousness at the eye disenchanted with contact at the eye disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with craving he grows disenchanted with the ear he grows disenchanted with the nose he grows disenchanted with the tongue he grows disenchanted with the body he grows disenchanted with the intellect disenchanted with ideas disenchanted with consciousness at the intellect disenchanted with contact at the intellect disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with craving disenchanted he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is fully released with full release there is the knowledge fully released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted at his words and while this explanation was being given the hearts of monks through no clinging on one occasion the blessed one was staying near then having gone for alms in vesali after his meal returning from his alms round ven ananda went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one just now lord in the early morning having put on my robe and carrying my bowl and outer robe i went into vesali for alms i saw a large number of licchavi boys practicing archery in the stadium building from a distance they were shooting arrows through a tiny keyhole without missing one right after the other on seeing this the thought occurred to me how trained these licchavi boys are how well trained these licchavi boys are in that from a distance they can shoot arrows through a tiny keyhole without missing one right after the other what do you think ananda which is harder to do harder to master to shoot arrows through a tiny keyhole without missing one right after the other or to take a horsehair split into seven strands and pierce tip with a tip this lord is harder to do harder to master to take a horsehair split into seven strands and pierce tip with a tip and they ananda pierce what is even harder to pierce those who pierce as it actually is present that this is stress who pierce as it actually is present that this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress therefore ananda your duty is the contemplation this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress your duty is the contemplation this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress in giving a meal the donor gives five things to the recipient which five he she gives life beauty happiness strength quick wittedness having given life he she has a share in long life either human or divine having given beauty he she has a share in beauty either human or divine having given happiness he she has a share in happiness either human or divine having given strength he she has a share in strength either human or divine having given quick wittedness he she has a share in quick wittedness either human or divine in giving a meal the donor gives these five things to the recipient the prudent person giving life strength beauty quick wittedness the wise person a giver of happiness attains happiness himself having given life strength beauty happiness quick wittedness he has long life status wherever he arises once the blessed one was dwelling in the vajji country at ukkacela on the bank of the river ganges not long after sariputta and maha moggallana had passed away and at that time the blessed one was seated in the open surrounded by company of monks the blessed one surveyed the silent gathering of monks and then spoke to them saying this assembly o bhikkhus appears indeed empty to me now that sariputta and maha moggallana have passed away not empty for me is an assembly nor need i have concern for a place where sariputta and maha moggallana dwell those who in the past have been holy ones fully enlightened ones those blessed ones too had such excellent pairs of disciples as i had in sariputta and maha moggallana those who in the future will be holy ones fully enlightened ones those blessed ones too will have such excellent pairs of disciples as i had in sariputta and maha moggallana marvelous it is most wonderful it is bhikkhus concerning those disciples that they will act in accordance with the master s dispensation will act in according to his advice that they will be dear to the four assemblies will be loved respected and honored by them marvelous it is most wonderful it is bhikkhus concerning the perfect ones that when such a pair of disciples has passed away there is no grief no lamentation on the part of the perfect one for of that which is born come to being put together and so is subject to dissolution how should it be said that it should not depart that indeed is not possible suppose monks a man catches six animals of different domains and different resorts of living a snake a crocodile a bird a dog a jackal and a monkey tethering each with a stout rope having tethered them with a stout rope he fastens the ropes together in the middle he lets go of them now monks these six animals of different domains and feeding habits would swing around and struggle each trying to get to his natural domain the snake would struggle thinking i ll get to the ant hill the crocodile i ll get into the water the bird i ll fly up in the air the dog i ll make for the village the jackal i ll make for the charnel ground the monkey i ll head for the forest now monks when those six hungry animals grew weary they would yield to the one that was the strongest go his way and be under his power in the same way monks whenever a monk fails to practice and develop mindfulness as to body the eye struggles to draw him towards attractive objects while unattractive objects are repellent to him the mind struggles to draw him towards attractive objects of thought while unattractive objects of thought are repellent to him this monks is lack of restraint and what monks is restraint in this a monk seeing objects with the eye is not drawn to attractive objects is not repelled by unattractive objects he remains with firmly established mindfulness as to body his mind being unrestricted suppose a man catches six animals tethered to a stout post or pillar monks denotes mindfulness as to body therefore monks this is how you must train yourselves we shall practice mindfulness as to body develop it make it our vehicle our dwelling place our resort we will build it up and undertake it thoroughly this monks is how you must train yourselves cunda the smith the buddha cunda the buddha he s shedding five hindrances so as to reach the unexcelled rest from the yoke taking the dhamma as mirror for knowing seeing myself i reflected on this body the whole thing inside out my own others how vain empty it looked thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living in the then enough punna let that be do not ask me that a second time a third time punna the ox duty ascetic asked the blessed one venerable sir this naked dog duty ascetic seniya does what is hard to do he eats his food when it is thrown on the ground that dog duty has long been taken up and practiced by him what will be his destination what will be his future course well punna since i certainly cannot persuade you when i say enough punna let that be do not ask me that i shall therefore answer you here punna someone develops the dog duty fully and unstintingly he develops the dog habit fully and unstintingly he develops the dog mind fully and unstintingly he develops dog behavior fully and unstintingly having done that on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the company of dogs but if his view is such as this by this virtue or duty or asceticism or religious life i shall become a great god or some lesser god that is wrong view in his case now there are two destinations for one with wrong view i say hell or the animal womb so punna if his dog duty is perfected it will lead him to the company of dogs if it is not it will lead him to hell when this was said seniya the naked dog duty ascetic wept and shed tears then the blessed one told punna son of the koliyans and an ox duty ascetic punna i could not persuade you when i said enough punna let that be do not ask me that venerable sir i am not weeping that the blessed one has spoken thus still this dog duty has long been taken up and practiced by me venerable sir there is this punna a son of the koliyans and an ox duty ascetic that ox duty has long been taken up and practiced by him what will be his destination what will be his future course enough seniya let that be do not ask me that a second time a third time seniya the naked dog duty ascetic asked the blessed one venerable sir there is this punna a son of the koliyans and an ox duty ascetic that ox duty has long been taken up and practiced by him what will be his destination what will be his future course well seniya since i certainly cannot persuade you when i say enough seniya let that be do not ask me that i shall therefore answer you here seniya someone develops the ox duty fully and unstintingly he develops the ox habit fully and unstintingly he develops the ox mind fully and unstintingly he develops the ox behavior fully and unstintingly having done that on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the company of oxen but if his view is such as this by this virtue or duty or asceticism or religious like i shall become a great god or some lesser god that is wrong view in his case now there are two destinations for one with wrong view i say hell or the animal womb so seniya if his ox duty is perfected it will lead him to the company of oxen if it is not it will lead him to hell when this was said punna a son of the koliyans and an ox duty ascetic wept and shed tears then the blessed one told seniya the naked dog duty ascetic seniya i could not persuade you when i said enough seniya let that be do not ask me that venerable sir i am not weeping that the blessed one has spoken thus still this ox duty has long been taken up and practiced by me venerable sir i have confidence in the blessed one thus the blessed one is capable of teaching me the dhamma in such a way that i may abandon this ox duty and that this naked dog duty ascetic seniya may abandon that dog duty then punna listen and heed well what i shall say yes venerable sir he replied the blessed one said this punna what is dark kamma with dark ripening here someone produces a kammic bodily process bound up with affliction and what is bright kamma with bright ripening here someone produces a kammic bodily process not bound up with affliction he produces a kammic verbal process not bound up with affliction he produces a kammic mental process not bound up with affliction by doing so he reappears in a world without affliction when that happens unafflicting contacts touch him being touched by these he feels unafflicting feelings entirely pleasant as in the case of the subhakinha the gods of refulgent glory thus a being s reappearance is due to a being he reappears owing to the kammas he has performed when he has reappeared contacts touch him thus i say are beings heirs of their kammas this is called bright kamma with bright ripening what is dark and bright kamma with dark and bright ripening here someone produces a kammic bodily process both bound up with affliction and not bound up with affliction verbal process mental process both bound up with affliction and not bound up with affliction by doing so he reappears in a world both with and without affliction when that happens both afflicting and unafflicting contacts touch him being touched by these he feels afflicting and unafflicting feelings with mingled pleasure and pain as in the case of human beings and some gods and some inhabitants of the states of deprivation thus a being s reappearance is due to a being he reappears owing to the kammas he has performed when he has reappeared contacts touch him thus i say are beings heirs of their kammas this is called dark and bright kamma with dark and bright ripening what is neither dark nor bright kamma with neither dark nor bright ripening that leads to the exhaustion of kamma as to these three kinds of kamma any volition in abandoning the kind of kamma that is dark with dark ripening any volition in abandoning the kind of kamma that is bright with bright ripening and any volition in abandoning the kind of kamma that is dark and bright with dark and bright ripening this is called neither dark nor bright kamma with neither dark nor bright ripening these are the four kinds of kamma proclaimed by me after realization myself with direct knowledge when this was said punna a son of the koliyans and an ox duty ascetic said to the blessed one i go to master gotama for refuge and to the dhamma and to the sangha of bhikkhus from today let master gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life but seniya the naked dog duty ascetic said i go to master gotama for refuge and to the dhamma and to the sangha of bhikkhus i would receive the going forth under master gotama and the full admission seniya one who belonged formerly to another sect and wants the going forth and the full admission in this dhamma and discipline lives on probation for four months at the end of the four months bhikkhus who are satisfied in their minds give him the going forth into homelessness and also the full admission to the bhikkhus state a difference in persons has become known to me in this probation period venerable sir if those who belonged formerly to another sect and want the going forth and the full admission in this dhamma and discipline live on probation for four months and at the end of four months bhikkhus who are satisfied in their minds give them the going forth into homelessness and the full admission to the bhikkhus state i will live on probation for four years and at the end of the four years let bhikkhus who are satisfied in their minds give me the going forth into homelessness and the full admission to the bhikkhus state and the venerable seniya became one of the arahants phenomena are preceded by the heart monks there are these two assemblies which two the assembly trained in bombast and not in cross questioning and the assembly trained in cross questioning and not in bombast and which is the assembly trained in bombast and not in cross questioning there is the case where in any assembly when the discourses of the tathagata deep deep in their meaning transcendent connected with emptiness are recited the monks don t listen don t lend ear don t set their hearts on knowing them don t regard them as worth grasping or mastering but when discourses that are literary works the works of poets artful in sound artful in expression the work of outsiders words of disciples are recited they listen they lend ear they set their hearts on knowing them they regard them as worth grasping mastering yet when they have mastered that dhamma they don t cross question one another about it don t dissect how is this what is the meaning of this they don t make open what isn t open don t make plain what isn t plain don t dispel doubt on its various doubtful points this is called an assembly trained in bombast not in cross questioning and which is the assembly trained in cross questioning and not in bombast there is the case where in any assembly when discourses that are literary works the works of poets artful in sound artful in rhetoric the work of outsiders words of disciples are recited the monks don t listen don t lend ear don t set their hearts on knowing them don t regard them as worth grasping or mastering but when the discourses of the tathagata deep deep in their meaning transcendent connected with emptiness are recited they listen they lend ear they set their hearts on knowing them they regard them as worth grasping mastering and when they have mastered that dhamma they cross question one another about it and dissect it how is this what is the meaning of this they make open what isn t open make plain what isn t plain dispel doubt on its various doubtful points this is called an assembly trained in cross questioning and not in bombast i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near now on that occasion potthapada the wanderer was sitting with his large following of wanderers all making a great noise racket discussing many kinds of bestial topics of conversation conversation about kings robbers ministers of state armies alarms battles food drink clothing furniture garlands scents relatives vehicles villages towns cities the countryside women heroes the gossip of the street the well tales of the dead tales of diversity the creation of the world of the sea talk of whether things exist or not then potthapada the wanderer saw the blessed one coming from afar and on seeing him hushed his following be quiet good sirs don t make any noise here comes gotama the contemplative he is fond of quietude and speaks in praise of quietude maybe if he perceives our group as quiet he will consider it worth his while to come our way so the wanderers fell silent then the blessed one went to potthapada and potthapada said to him come blessed one welcome blessed one it s been a long time since the blessed one has gone out of his way to come here sit down blessed one this seat has been prepared so the blessed one sat on the prepared seat potthapada taking a lower seat sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him for what topic of conversation are you gathered together here in the midst of what topic of conversation have you been interrupted when this was said potthapada replied never mind lord about the topic of conversation for which we have gathered here it won t be difficult for the blessed one to hear about that later for the past few days a discussion has arisen among the many sects of brahmans contemplatives gathered and sitting together in the debating hall concerning the ultimate cessation of perception how is there the ultimate cessation of perception with regard to this some said a person s perception arises and ceases without cause without reason when it arises one is percipient when it ceases one is not percipient then someone else said no that s not how it is perception is a person s self which comes and goes when it comes one is percipient when it goes one is not percipient that s how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception then someone else said no that s not how it is for there are brahmans contemplatives of great power great potency they draw perception in and out of a person when they draw it in one is percipient when they draw it out one is not percipient that s how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception then someone else said no that s not how it is for there are devas of great power great potency they draw perception in and out of a person when they draw it in one is percipient when they draw it out one is not percipient that s how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception then the memory of the blessed one arose within me ah the blessed one ah the one well gone who surely is well skilled in these matters the blessed one is skilled and expert in the ultimate cessation of perception so what lord is the ultimate cessation of perception in this regard potthapada those brahmans contemplatives who say that a person s perception arises ceases without cause without reason are wrong from the very start why is that because a person s perception arises ceases with a cause with a reason with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases and what is that training there is the case where a tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly self awakened as in this is how a monk is consummate in virtue seeing that these five hindrances have been abandoned within him he becomes glad glad he becomes enraptured enraptured his body grows tranquil his body tranquil he is sensitive to pleasure feeling pleasure his mind becomes concentrated quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities the monk enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation his earlier perception of sensuality ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of rapture pleasure born of seclusion on that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of rapture pleasure born of seclusion and thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases then with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations the monk enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance his earlier perception of a refined truth of rapture pleasure born of seclusion ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of rapture pleasure born of concentration on that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of rapture pleasure born of concentration and thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases and then with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding his earlier perception of a refined truth of rapture pleasure born of concentration ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of equanimity on that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of equanimity and thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases and then with the abandoning of pleasure and pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress the monk enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain his earlier perception of a refined truth of equanimity ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor pain on that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor pain and thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases and then with the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving infinite space the monk enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space his earlier perception of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor pain ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space on that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space and thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases and then with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space perceiving infinite consciousness the monk enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness his earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness on that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness and thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases and then with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness thinking there is nothing enters remains in the dimension of nothingness his earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingness on that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingness and thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases now when the monk is percipient of himself here then from there to there step by step he touches the peak of perception as he remains at the peak of perception the thought occurs to him thinking is bad for me not thinking is better for me if i were to think and will this perception of mine would cease and a grosser perception would appear what if i were neither to think nor to will now what do you think potthapada have you ever before heard of such an alert step by step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception no lord and here is how i understand the dhamma taught by the blessed one when the monk is percipient of himself here then from there to there step by step he touches the peak of perception as he remains at the peak of perception the thought occurs to him thinking is bad for me not thinking is better for me if i were to think and will this perception of mine would cease and a grosser perception would appear what if i were neither to think nor to will so he neither thinks nor wills and as he is neither thinking nor willing that perception ceases and another grosser perception does not appear he touches cessation this potthapada is how there is the alert step by step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception that s right potthapada but lord does the blessed one describe one peak of perception or many peaks of perception potthapada i describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception and how does the blessed one describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception in whatever way one touches cessation potthapada that s the way i describe the peak of perception now lord does perception arise first and knowledge after or does knowledge arise first and perception after or do perception knowledge arise simultaneously potthapada perception arises first and knowledge after and the arising of knowledge comes from the arising of perception one discerns it s in dependence on this now lord is perception a person s self or is perception one thing and self another what self do you posit potthapada then potthapada your self would be gross possessed of form made up of the four great existents feeding on physical food that being the case then for you perception would be one thing and self another and it s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another even as there remains this gross self possessed of form made up of the four great existents and feeding on food one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away it s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another then lord i posit a mind made self complete in all its parts not inferior in its faculties then potthapada your self would be mind made complete in all its parts not inferior in its faculties that being the case then for you perception would be one thing and self another and it s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another even as there remains this mind made self complete in all its parts not inferior in its faculties one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away it s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another then lord i posit a formless self made of perception then potthapada your self would be formless and made of perception that being the case then for you perception would be one thing and self another and it s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another even as there remains this formless self made of perception one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away it s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another is it possible for me to know lord whether perception is a person s self or if perception is one thing and self another potthapada having other views other practices other satisfactions other aims other teachers it s hard for you to know whether perception is a person s self or if perception is one thing and self another potthapada i haven t expounded that the cosmos is eternal that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless then is it the case that the cosmos is not eternal that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless potthapada i haven t expounded that the cosmos is not eternal that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless then is it the case that the cosmos is finite the cosmos is infinite the soul the body are the same the soul is one thing and the body another after death a tathagata exists after death a tathagata does not exist after death a tathagata both exists does not exist after death a tathagata neither exists nor does not exist that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless potthapada i haven t expounded that after death a tathagata neither exists nor does not exist that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless but why hasn t the blessed one expounded these things because they are not conducive to the goal are not conducive to the dhamma are not basic to the holy life they don t lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to self awakening to unbinding that s why i haven t expounded them and what i have expounded that this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress and why has the blessed one expounded these things because they are conducive to the goal conducive to the dhamma and basic to the holy life they lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to self awakening to unbinding that s why i have expounded them so it is blessed one so it is o one well gone well now it s time for the blessed one to do as he sees fit then the blessed one got up from his seat and left not long after he had left the wanderers with sneering words jeered at potthapada the wanderer from all sides so whatever gotama the contemplative says sir potthapada rejoices in his every word so it is blessed one so it is o one well gone but when this was said potthapada the wanderer replied to the wanderers i too don t understand gotama the contemplative as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is infinite or the cosmos is finite or whether after death a tathagata neither exists nor does not exist but gotama the contemplative describes a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the dhamma and consonant with the dhamma and when a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the dhamma and consonant with the dhamma is being explained why shouldn t a knowledgeable person such as myself rejoice in the well spokenness of gotama the contemplative s well spoken words then two or three days later when this was said i replied to the wanderers i too don t understand gotama the contemplative as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is infinite or the cosmos is finite or whether after death a tathagata neither exists nor does not exist but gotama the contemplative describes a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the dhamma and consonant with the dhamma and when a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the dhamma and consonant with the dhamma is being explained why shouldn t a knowledgeable person such as myself rejoice in the well spokenness of gotama the contemplative s well spoken words the buddha potthapada all those wanderers are blind and have no eyes you alone among them have eyes i have taught and declared some teachings to be categorical and some teachings to be non categorical and what are the teachings that i have taught and declared to be non categorical the statement that the cosmos is eternal i have taught and declared to be an non categorical teaching the statement that the cosmos is not eternal the cosmos is finite the cosmos is infinite the soul the body are the same the soul is one thing and the body another after death a tathagata exists after death a tathagata does not exist after death a tathagata both exists does not exist after death a tathagata neither exists nor does not exist i have taught and declared to be an non categorical teaching and why have i taught and declared these teachings to be non categorical because they are not conducive to the goal are not conducive to the dhamma are not basic to the holy life they don t lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to self awakening to unbinding that s why i have taught and declared them to be non categorical and what have i taught and declared to be categorical teachings the statement that this is stress i have taught and declared to be a categorical teaching the statement that this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress i have taught and declared to be a categorical teaching and why have i taught and declared these teachings to be categorical because they are conducive to the goal conducive to the dhamma and basic to the holy life they lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to self awakening to unbinding that s why i have taught and declared them to be categorical there are some brahmans contemplatives with a doctrine view like this after death the self is exclusively happy and free from disease i approached them and asked them is it true that you have a doctrine view like this after death the self is exclusively happy and free from disease when asked this they replied yes so i asked them but do you dwell having known or seen an exclusively happy world when asked this they said no so i asked them but have you ever been aware of a self exclusively happy for a day or a night or for half a day or half a night when asked this they said no so i asked them but do you know that this is the path this is the practice for the realization of an exclusively happy world when asked this they said no so i asked them but have you heard the voices of devas reborn in an exclusively happy world saying practice well my dears practice straightforwardly my dears for the realization of an exclusively happy world because it was through such a practice that we ourselves have been reborn in an exclusively happy world when asked this they said no so what do you think potthapada when this is the case don t the words of those brahmans contemplatives turn out to be unconvincing yes lord when this is the case the words of those brahmans contemplatives turn out to be unconvincing potthapada it s as if a man were to say i m in love with the most beautiful woman in this country and other people were to say to him well my good man this most beautiful woman in this country with whom you are in love do you know if she s of the warrior caste the priestly caste the merchant caste or the laborer caste and when asked this he would say no then they would say to him well then do you know her name or clan name whether she s tall short or of medium height whether she s dark fair or ruddy skinned do you know what village or town or city she s from when asked this he would say no then they would say to him so you ve never known or seen the woman you re in love with when asked this he would say yes so what do you think potthapada when this is the case don t the words of that man turn out to be unconvincing yes lord in the same way there are some brahmans contemplatives with a doctrine view like this after death the self is exclusively happy and free from disease don t the words of those brahmans contemplatives turn out to be unconvincing yes lord so what do you think potthapada when this is the case don t the words of that man turn out to be unconvincing yes lord in the same way there are some brahmans contemplatives with a doctrine view like this after death the self is exclusively happy and free from disease don t the words of those brahmans contemplatives turn out to be unconvincing yes lord when this is the case the words of those brahmans contemplatives turn out to be unconvincing potthapada there are these i teach the dhamma for the abandoning of the gross acquisition of a self such that when you practice it defiling mental qualities will be abandoned bright mental qualities will grow and you will enter remain in the culmination abundance of discernment having known realized it for yourself in the here now if the thought should occur to you that when defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown and one enters remains in the culmination abundance of discernment having known realized it for oneself in the here now one s abiding is stressful painful you should not see it in that way when defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown and one enters remains in the culmination abundance of discernment having known realized it for oneself in the here now there is joy rapture serenity mindfulness alertness and a pleasant happy abiding i also teach the dhamma for the abandoning of the mind made acquisition of a self for the abandoning of the formless acquisition of a self such that when you practice it defiling mental qualities will be abandoned bright mental qualities will grow and you will enter remain in the culmination abundance of discernment having known realized it for yourself in the here now when defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown and one enters remains in the culmination abundance of discernment having known realized it for oneself in the here now there is joy rapture serenity mindfulness alertness and a pleasant happy abiding in the past i have been asked what friend is the gross acquisition of a self for whose abandoning you teach the dhamma such that when you practice it defiling mental qualities will be abandoned bright mental qualities will grow and you will enter remain in the culmination abundance of discernment having known realized it for yourself in the here now when asked this i would answer in the past i have been asked what friend is the mind made acquisition of a self the formless acquisition of a self for whose abandoning you teach the dhamma when asked this i would answer what do you think potthapada when this is the case don t those words turn out to be convincing yes lord when this is the case those words turn out to be convincing potthapada it s as if a man at a crossroads were to build a staircase for ascending to a palace and other people were to say to him well my good man this palace for which you are building a staircase do you know whether it s east west north or south of here whether it s high low or in between he would say so what do you think potthapada when this is the case don t the words of that man turn out to be convincing yes lord in the same way in the past i have been asked what friend is the gross acquisition of a self the mind made acquisition of a self the formless acquisition of a self for whose abandoning you teach the dhamma when asked this i would answer what do you think potthapada when this is the case don t those words turn out to be convincing yes lord when this is the case those words turn out to be convincing when this was said citta the elephant trainer s son said to the blessed one when there is a gross acquisition of a self is it the case then that one s mind made acquisition of a self and formless acquisition of a self are null void and only one s gross acquisition of a self is true and when there is a mind made acquisition of a self is it the case then that one s gross acquisition of a self and formless acquisition of a self are null void and only one s mind made acquisition of a self is true and when there is a formless acquisition of a self is it the case then that one s gross acquisition of a self and mind made acquisition of a self are null void and only one s formless acquisition of a self is true citta when there is a gross acquisition of a self it s not classified either as a mind made acquisition of a self or as a formless acquisition of a self it s classified just as a gross acquisition of a self when there is a mind made acquisition of a self it s not classified either as a gross acquisition of a self or as a formless acquisition of a self it s classified just as a mind made acquisition of a self when there is a formless acquisition of a self it s not classified either as a gross acquisition of a self or as a mind made acquisition of a self it is classified just as a formless acquisition of a self suppose they were to ask you did you exist in the past did you not not exist will you exist in the future will you not not exist do you exist now do you not not exist thus asked how would you answer thus asked lord i would answer i existed in the past i did not not exist i will exist in the future i will not not exist i exist now i do not not exist that s how i would answer suppose citta they were to ask you whatever your past acquisition of a self is that alone your true acquisition of self while the future present ones are null void whatever your future acquisition of a self is that alone your true acquisition of a self while the past present ones are null void whatever your present acquisition of a self is that alone your true acquisition of a self while the past future ones are null void thus asked how would you answer thus asked lord i would answer whatever my past acquisition of a self on that occasion that alone was my true acquisition of a self while future present ones were null void whatever my future acquisition of a self on that occasion that alone will be my true acquisition of a self while the past present ones will be null void whatever my present acquisition of a self on that occasion that alone is my true acquisition of a self while the past future ones are null void in the same way citta when there is a gross acquisition of a self it s classified just as a gross acquisition of a self when there is a mind made acquisition of a self when there is a formless acquisition of a self it s not classified either as a gross acquisition of a self or as a mind made acquisition of a self it s classified just as a formless acquisition of a self in the same way when there is a gross acquisition of a self it s classified just as a gross acquisition of a self when there is a mind made acquisition of a self when there is a formless acquisition of a self it s not classified either as a gross acquisition of a self or as a mind made acquisition of a self it s classified just as a formless acquisition of a self citta these are the world s designations the world s expressions the world s ways of speaking the world s descriptions with which the tathagata expresses himself but without grasping to them and even though a disciple of the noble ones lives off lumps of alms food and wears rag robes still because he is endowed with four qualities he is freed from hell freed from the animal womb freed from the realm of hungry shades freed from the plane of deprivation the bad destinations the lower realms and what are the four there is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the awakened one indeed the blessed one is worthy and rightly self awakened consummate in knowledge conduct well gone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the teacher of divine human beings awakened blessed he she is endowed with verified confidence in the dhamma the dhamma is well expounded by the blessed one to be seen here now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselves he she is endowed with verified confidence in the sangha the sangha of the blessed one s disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straight forwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully in other words the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types he she is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones untorn unbroken unspotted unsplattered liberating praised by the wise untarnished leading to concentration he she is endowed with these four qualities and between the gaining of the four continents and the gaining of these four qualities the gaining of the four continents is not equal to one sixteenth of the gaining of these four qualities i have heard that on one occasion when the blessed one was on a wandering tour among the so the brahman householders of sala went to the blessed one on arrival some of them bowed down to the blessed one and sat to one side some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies sat to one side some of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palm to palm over their hearts some of them sat to one side having announced their name clan some of them sat to one side in silence as they were sitting there the blessed one asked them householders is there any teacher agreeable to you in whom you have found grounded conviction no lord there is no teacher agreeable to us in whom we have found grounded conviction as you have not found an agreeable teacher you should adopt and practice this safe bet teaching for this safe bet teaching when accepted and adopted will be to your long term welfare happiness and what is the safe bet teaching what do you think householders don t these contemplatives brahmans speak in direct opposition to each other yes lord what do you think householders don t these contemplatives brahmans speak in direct opposition to each other yes lord what do you think householders don t these contemplatives brahmans speak in direct opposition to each other yes lord there are some contemplatives brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view there is no total formlessness some contemplatives brahmans speaking in direct opposition to those contemplatives brahmans say this there is total formlessness what do you think householders don t these contemplatives brahmans speak in direct opposition to each other yes lord with regard to this an observant person considers thus as for those venerable contemplatives brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view there is no total formlessness i haven t seen that as for those venerable contemplatives brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view there is total formlessness i haven t known that if i not knowing not seeing were to take one side and declare only this is true anything otherwise is worthless that would not be fitting for me as for those venerable contemplatives brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view there is no total formlessness if their statement is true there s the safe bet possibility that i might reappear among the mind made devas of form as for those venerable contemplatives brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view there is total formlessness if their statement is true there s the safe bet possibility that i might reappear among the perception made devas of no form the taking up of rods weapons quarrels contention disputes recrimination divisiveness false speech are seen to arise from form but not from total formlessness reflecting thus he practices for disenchantment toward forms for dispassion toward forms and for the cessation of forms there are some contemplatives brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view there is no total cessation of becoming some contemplatives brahmans speaking in direct opposition to those contemplatives brahmans say this there is total cessation of becoming what do you think householders don t these contemplatives brahmans speak in direct opposition to each other yes lord with regard to this an observant person considers thus as for those venerable contemplatives brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view there is no total cessation of becoming i haven t seen that as for those venerable contemplatives brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view there is total cessation of becoming i haven t known that if i not knowing not seeing were to take one side and declare only this is true anything otherwise is worthless that would not be fitting for me as for those venerable contemplatives brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view there is no total cessation of becoming if their statement is true there s the safe bet possibility that i might reappear among the perception made devas of no form as for those venerable contemplatives brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view there is total cessation of becoming if their statement is true it is possible that i will be totally unbound in the here now as for those venerable contemplatives brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view there is no total cessation of becoming this view of theirs borders on passion borders on fettering borders on relishing borders on grasping borders on clinging as for those venerable contemplatives brahmans who hold this doctrine hold this view there is total cessation of becoming this view of theirs borders on non passion borders on non fettering borders on non relishing borders on non grasping borders on non clinging reflecting thus he practices for disenchantment toward becomings for dispassion toward becomings and for the cessation of becomings householders there are these four types of individuals to be found existing in the world which four there is the case where a certain individual torments himself and is devoted to the practice of torturing himself there is the case where a certain individual torments others and is devoted to the practice of torturing others there is the case where a certain individual torments himself and is devoted to the practice of torturing himself and also torments others and is devoted to the practice of torturing others there is the case where a certain individual neither torments himself nor is he devoted to the practice of torturing himself neither torments others nor is he devoted to the practice of torturing others neither tormenting himself nor tormenting others he dwells in the here now free of hunger unbound cooled sensitive to happiness with a brahma like mind and which is the individual who torments himself and is devoted to the practice of torturing himself there is the case where a certain individual goes without cloth rejecting conventions licking his hands not coming when called not staying when asked he does not accept food brought or specially made he does not consent to an invitation to a meal he doesn t receive anything from the mouth of a pot from the mouth of a container across a threshold across a stick across a pestle from two eating together from a pregnant woman from a woman nursing a child from a woman living with a man from where it is announced that food is to be distributed from where a dog is waiting from where flies are buzzing he accepts no meat no distilled liquor no wine no fermented liquor he limits himself to one house for one morsel to two houses for two morsels to seven houses for seven morsels he lives on one saucerful a day two saucerfuls a day seven saucerfuls a day he takes food once a day once every two days once every seven days and so on up to once every half month he remains devoted to the practice of taking food at stated intervals he eats a diet of green vegetables or millet or wild rice or hide parings or moss or rice bran or rice water or sesame flour or grass or cow dung he lives off forest roots fruits he eats fallen fruits he clothes himself in hemp in canvas in shrouds in thrown away rags in tree bark in antelope hide in wood shavings fabric in head hair wool in wild animal wool in owls wings he is a hair beard puller one devoted to the practice of pulling out his hair beard he is a stander one who rejects seats he is a hands around the knees sitter one devoted to the exertion of sitting with his hands around his knees he is a spike mattresser one who makes his bed on a bed of spikes he is a third time in the evening bather one who stays devoted to the practice of bathing in water thus in these many ways he is devoted to the practice of tormenting persecuting the body this is called an individual who torments himself and is devoted to the practice of torturing himself and which is the individual who torments others and is devoted to the practice of torturing others there is the case where a certain individual is a butcher of sheep a butcher of pigs a butcher of fowl a trapper a hunter a fisherman a thief an executioner and which is the individual who torments himself and is devoted to the practice of torturing himself and also torments others and is devoted to the practice of torturing others there is the case where an individual is a head anointed noble warrior king or a brahman of great wealth having had a new temple built to the east of the city having shaved off his hair beard having dressed himself in a rough hide having smeared his body with ghee oil and scratching his back with a deer horn he enters the new temple along with his chief queen brahman high brahman there he makes his bed on the bare ground strewn with grass the king lives off the milk from the first teat of a cow with an identical calf the queen lives off the milk from the second teat the brahman high brahman off the milk from the third teat the milk from the fourth teat they pour he says let so many bulls be slaughtered for the sacrifice let so many bullocks so many heifers so many goats so many sheep let so many horses be slaughtered for the sacrifice and which is the individual who neither torments himself nor is devoted to the practice of torturing himself neither torments others nor is devoted to the practice of torturing others who neither tormenting himself nor tormenting others dwells in the here now free of hunger unbound cooled sensitive to happiness with a brahma like mind there is the case where a tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly self awakened he teaches the dhamma admirable in its beginning admirable in its middle admirable in its end he proclaims the holy life both in its

never before been heard from him that is what the blessed one said gratified ven bhumija delighted in the blessed one s words i thought thoroughbredflame s unbinding whatever medicines are found in the world many and varied none are equal to the dhamma drink of this monks and having drunk the medicine of the dhamma you ll be untouched by age and death having meditated and seen you ll be healed

well composed to singleness as is that thus will this likewise be exhaling foulness evil smells a thing it is enjoyed by fools diligently considering it by day and night thus seeing it with my own wisdom having seen i turned away dispassionate with my diligence carefully i examined the body and saw this as it really is both within and without unlusting and dispassionate within this body then was i by diligence from fetters freed peaceful was i and quite cool monks there are these three kinds of suffering the peacocks with lovely feathers lovely wings lovely blue necks and lovely faces

well in the good teaching of the buddha experience that highest unwavering state most pure subtle most hard to see monks there are these three types of individuals to be found existing in the world which three an individual like an inscription in rock an individual like an inscription in soil and an individual like an inscription in water and how is an individual like an inscription in rock there is the case where a certain individual is often angered and his anger stays with him a long time just as an inscription in rock is not quickly effaced by wind or water and lasts a long time in the same way a certain individual is often angered and his anger stays with him a long time this is called an individual like an inscription in rock and how is an individual like an inscription in soil there is the case where a certain individual is often angered but his anger doesn t stay with him a long time just as an inscription in soil is quickly effaced by wind or water and doesn t last a long time in the same way a certain individual is often angered but his anger doesn t stay with him a long time this is called an individual like an inscription in soil and how is an individual like an inscription in water there is the case where a certain individual when spoken to roughly spoken to harshly spoken to in an unpleasing way is nevertheless congenial companionable courteous just as an inscription in water immediately disappears and doesn t last a long time in the same way a certain individual when spoken to roughly spoken to harshly spoken to in an unpleasing way is nevertheless

ripening in the sensuality property would sensuality becoming be discerned no lord thus kamma is the field consciousness the seed and craving the moisture if there were no kamma ripening in the form property would form becoming be discerned no lord thus kamma is the field consciousness the seed and craving the moisture the consciousness of living beings hindered by ignorance fettered by craving is established in tuned to a middling property thus there is the production of renewed becoming in the future if there were no kamma ripening in the formless property would formless becoming be discerned no lord thus kamma is the field consciousness the seed and craving the moisture the consciousness of living beings hindered by ignorance fettered by craving is established in tuned to a refined property thus there is the production of renewed becoming in the future this is how there is becoming once the blessed one dwelt at vesali in the great forest at the gabled house in the evening after had arisen from his seclusion he went to the sick room and sat down on a prepared seat being seated he addressed the monks as follows o monks mindfully and clearly comprehending should a monk spend his time this is my injunction to you and how o monks is a monk clearly comprehending he applies clear comprehension in going forward and going back in looking straight on and in looking elsewhere in bending and in stretching his limbs in wearing the robes and carrying the alms bowl in eating drinking chewing and savoring in obeying the calls of nature in walking standing sitting falling asleep waking speaking and being silent in all that he applies clear comprehension so monks is a monk clearly comprehending if a monk is thus mindful and clearly comprehending ardent earnest

has arisen in me it is conditioned not unconditioned conditioned by what even by this sense impression it is conditioned and this sense impression indeed is impermanent compounded dependently arisen but if this painful feeling that has arisen is conditioned by a sense impression which is impermanent compounded and dependently arisen how could such a painful feeling be permanent in regard to both sense impression and painful feeling he dwells contemplating impermanence dwells contemplating evanescence dwells contemplating detachment dwells contemplating cessation dwells contemplating relinquishment and in him who thus dwells the underlying tendency to resistance in regard to sense impression and painful feeling vanishes if a neutral feeling arises in him he knows now a neutral feeling has arisen in me it is conditioned not unconditioned conditioned by what even by this sense impression it is conditioned and this sense impression indeed is impermanent compounded dependently arisen but if this neutral feeling that has arisen is conditioned by a sense impression which is impermanent compounded and dependently arisen how could such a neutral feeling be permanent in regard to both sense impression and neutral feeling he dwells contemplating impermanence dwells contemplating evanescence dwells contemplating detachment dwells contemplating cessation dwells contemplating relinquishment and in him who thus dwells the underlying tendency to ignorance in regard to sense impression and neutral feeling vanishes thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living

mara gave order mara thus striking the earth with his palm and thereby producing a dreadful sound as when a storm cloud thunders and causes lightning during rainy season sent his black army to the midst of the devas nevertheless unable to bring the devas under his sway he filled with anger he recoiled then the seeing one the buddha knowing perfectly well what had transpired addressed his disciples who take delight in the word of the buddha monks the host of mara have come and gone know them beware of them and they non arahants hearing the word of the buddha strove to gain deliverance from their defilements from the passion free arahants the army of mara has departed even so much as a hair in them arahants was not affected all those disciples monks are victors in the war of passions they are free from fear glorious and renowned among mankind they live rejoicing with aryan disciples praising thus mara departed monks these four types of individuals are to be found existing in the world which four the one who practices neither for his her own benefit nor for that of others the one who practices for the benefit of others but not for his her own the one who practices for his her own benefit but not for that of others the one who practices for his her own benefit and for that of others these are the four types of individuals to be found existing in the world i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion the blessed one was worshipped revered honored venerated and given homage a recipient of robes alms food lodgings medicinal requisites for the sick the community of monks was also worshipped revered honored venerated and given homage a recipient of robes alms food lodgings medicinal requisites for the sick but the wanderers of other sects were not worshipped revered honored venerated or given homage nor were they recipients of robes alms food lodgings or medicinal requisites for the sick so the wanderers of other sects unable to stand the veneration given to the blessed one and the community of monks on seeing monks in village or wilderness would insult revile irritate harass them with discourteous abusive language then a large number of monks went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they said to him at present the blessed one is worshipped revered honored venerated and given homage a recipient of robes alms food lodgings medicinal requisites for the sick the community of monks is also worshipped revered honored venerated and given homage a recipient of robes alms food lodgings medicinal requisites for the sick but the wanderers of other sects are not worshipped revered honored venerated or given homage nor are they recipients of robes alms food lodgings or medicinal requisites for the sick so the wanderers of other sects unable to stand the veneration given to the blessed one and the community of monks on seeing monks in village or wilderness insult revile irritate harass them with discourteous abusive language then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed when in contact with pleasure or pain in village or wilderness don t take it as yours or as others contacts make contact dependent on a sense of acquisition where there s no sense of acquisition contacts would make contact with what see also on the occasion when a virtuous person who has gone forth approaches a family there the people give rise to a great deal of merit by five means which five on the occasion when a virtuous person who has gone forth approaches a family the minds of the people on seeing him are brightened on that occasion the family is practicing the practice leading to heaven on the occasion when a virtuous person who has gone forth approaches a family the people rise up to greet him bow down give him her a seat on that occasion the family is practicing the practice leading to birth in a high family on the occasion when a virtuous person who has gone forth approaches a family the people dispel their stinginess on that occasion the family is practicing the practice leading to great influence on the occasion when a virtuous person who has gone forth approaches a family the people share with him her in line with their ability in line with their strength on that occasion the family is practicing the practice leading to great wealth on the occasion when a virtuous person who has gone forth approaches a family the people inquire ask questions listen to the dhamma on that occasion the family is practicing the practice leading to great discernment on the occasion when a virtuous person who has gone forth approaches a family there the people give rise to a great deal of merit by these five means see also i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion ven nanda the blessed one s brother son of his maternal aunt announced to a large number of monks i don t enjoy leading the holy life my friends i can t keep up the holy life giving up the training i will return to the common life then a certain monk went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he told the blessed one lord ven nanda the blessed one s brother son of his maternal aunt has announced to a large number of monks i don t enjoy leading the holy life my friends i can t keep up the holy life giving up the training i will return to the common life then the blessed one told a certain monk come monk in my name call nanda saying the teacher calls you friend nanda responding as you say lord to the blessed one the monk went to ven nanda on arrival he said the teacher calls you friend nanda responding as you say my friend to the monk ven nanda went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him is it true nanda that you have announced to a large number of monks i don t enjoy leading the holy life my friends i can t keep up the holy life giving up the training i will return to the common life yes lord but why nanda don t you enjoy leading the holy life why can t you keep up the holy life why giving up the training will you return to the common life lord as i was leaving home a sakyan girl the envy of the countryside glanced up at me with her hair half combed and said hurry back master recollecting that i don t enjoy leading the holy life i can t keep up the holy life giving up the training i will return to the common life then taking ven nanda by the arm as a strong man might flex his extended arm or extend his flexed arm the blessed one disappeared from jeta s grove and reappeared among the devas of the heaven of the thirty three t vati sa now on that occasion about dove footed nymphs had come to wait upon sakka the ruler of the devas the blessed one said to ven nanda nanda do you see these dove footed nymphs yes lord what do you think nanda which is lovelier better looking more charming the sakyan girl the envy of the countryside or these dove footed nymphs lord compared to these dove footed nymphs the sakyan girl the envy of the countryside is like a cauterized monkey with its ears nose cut off she doesn t count she s not even a small fraction there s no comparison the dove footed nymphs are lovelier better looking more charming then take joy nanda take joy i am your guarantor for getting dove footed nymphs if the blessed one is my guarantor for getting dove footed nymphs i will enjoy leading the holy life under the blessed one then taking ven nanda by the arm as a strong man might flex his extended arm or extend his flexed arm the blessed one disappeared from among the devas of the heaven of the thirty three and reappeared at jeta s grove the monks heard they say that ven nanda the blessed one s brother son of his maternal aunt is leading the holy life for the sake of nymphs they say that the blessed one is his guarantor for getting dove footed nymphs then the monks who were companions of ven nanda went around addressing him as they would a hired hand a person who had been bought venerable nanda they say has been hired venerable nanda they say has been bought then ven nanda humiliated ashamed disgusted that the monks who were his companions were addressing him as they would a hired hand a person who had been bought went to dwell alone secluded heedful ardent resolute he in no long time entered remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing realizing it for himself right in the here now he knew birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for the sake of this world and thus ven nanda became another one of the arahants then a certain devat in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of jeta s grove approached the blessed one on arrival having bowed down to him she stood to one side as she was standing there she said to the blessed one lord ven nanda the blessed one s brother son of his maternal aunt through the ending of the effluents has entered remains in the effluent free awareness release discernment release directly knowing realizing them for himself right in the here now and within the blessed one the knowledge arose nanda through the ending of the effluents has entered remains in the effluent free awareness release discernment release directly knowing realizing them for himself right in the here now then when the night had passed ven nanda went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one lord about the blessed one s being my guarantor for getting dove footed nymphs i hereby release the blessed one from that promise nanda having comprehended your awareness with my own awareness i realized that nanda through the ending of the effluents has entered remains in the effluent free awareness release discernment release directly knowing realizing them for himself right in the here now and a devat informed me that ven nanda through the ending of the effluents has entered remains in the effluent free awareness release discernment release directly knowing realizing them for himself right in the here now when your mind through lack of clinging was released from the effluents i was thereby released from that promise then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed in whom the mire of sensuality is crossed over i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near p va at the ajakal paka herd of goats shrine the dwelling of the ajakal paka spirit and on that occasion in the pitch black darkness of the night the blessed one was sitting in the open air and the rain was falling in scattered drops then the ajakal paka spirit wanting to cause fear terror horripilation in the blessed one went to him and on arrival not far from him three times made a commotion pandemonium commotion pandemonium commotion pandemonium commotion pandemonium that s a goblin for you contemplative then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed when with regard to his own qualities on one occasion then ven pavittha said to ven musila musila my friend putting aside conviction putting aside preference putting aside tradition putting aside reasoning through analogies putting aside an agreement through pondering views do you have truly personal knowledge that from birth as a requisite condition come aging death yes pavittha my friend putting aside conviction preference tradition reasoning through analogies an agreement through pondering views i do have truly personal knowledge that from birth as a requisite condition come aging death musila my friend putting aside conviction putting aside preference putting aside tradition putting aside reasoning through analogies putting aside an agreement through pondering views do you have truly personal knowledge that from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications yes pavittha my friend putting aside conviction preference tradition reasoning through analogies an agreement through pondering views i do have truly personal knowledge that from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications musila my friend putting aside conviction putting aside preference putting aside tradition putting aside reasoning through analogies putting aside an agreement through pondering views do you have truly personal knowledge that from the cessation of birth comes the cessation of aging death yes pavittha my friend putting aside conviction preference tradition reasoning through analogies an agreement through pondering views i do have truly personal knowledge that from the cessation of birth comes the cessation of aging death musila my friend putting aside conviction putting aside preference putting aside tradition putting aside reasoning through analogies putting aside an agreement through pondering views do you have truly personal knowledge that from the cessation of ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications yes pavittha my friend putting aside conviction preference tradition reasoning through analogies an agreement through pondering views i do have truly personal knowledge that from the cessation of ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications musila my friend putting aside conviction putting aside preference putting aside tradition putting aside reasoning through analogies putting aside an agreement through pondering views do you have truly personal knowledge that the cessation of becoming is unbinding yes pavittha my friend putting aside conviction preference tradition reasoning through analogies an agreement through pondering views i do have truly personal knowledge that the cessation of becoming is unbinding then ven musila you are an arahant whose fermentations are ended when this was said ven musila was silent then ven narada said pavittha my friend it would be good if i were to get that question ask me that question and i will answer it for you then ven narada will get that question i will ask ven narada that question and may he answer that question for me then ven narada you are an arahant whose fermentations are ended my friend although i have seen properly with right discernment as it actually is present that the cessation of becoming is unbinding still i am not an arahant whose fermentations are ended when this was said ven ananda said to ven pavittha when he speaks in this way friend pavittha what do you have to say about ven narada when ven narada speaks in this way friend ananda i have nothing to say about ven narada except that he is admirable skillful thus have i heard once while the blessed one was staying in the vicinity of saavatthi in the jeta grove in anaathapi n dika s monastery a certain deity whose surpassing brilliance and beauty illumined the entire jeta grove late one night came to the presence of the blessed one having come to him and offered profound salutations he stood on one side and spoke to him reverently in the following verse many deities and human beings have pondered what are blessings which they hope will bring them safety declare to them sir the highest blessing here ends the discourse on blessings to this the blessed one replied i have heard that on one occasion ven brahman the holy life is lived under the blessed one with the aim of abandoning desire is there a path is there a practice for the abandoning of that desire yes there is a path there is a practice for the abandoning of that desire what is the path the practice for the abandoning of that desire brahman there is the case where a monk develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire the fabrications of exertion he develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on persistence concentration founded on intent concentration founded on discrimination the fabrications of exertion this brahman is the path this is the practice for the abandoning of that desire if that s so master ananda then it s an endless path and not one with an end for it s impossible that one could abandon desire by means of desire in that case brahman let me question you on this matter answer as you see fit what do you think didn t you first have desire thinking i ll go to the park and then when you reached the park wasn t that particular desire allayed yes sir didn t you first have persistence thinking i ll go to the park and then when you reached the park wasn t that particular persistence allayed yes sir didn t you first have the intent thinking i ll go to the park and then when you reached the park wasn t that particular intent allayed yes sir didn t you first have an act of discrimination thinking i ll go to the park and then when you reached the park wasn t that particular act of discrimination allayed yes sir so it is with an arahant whose mental effluents are ended who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who is released through right gnosis whatever desire he first had for the attainment of arahantship on attaining arahantship that particular desire is allayed whatever persistence he first had for the attainment of arahantship on attaining arahantship that particular persistence is allayed whatever intent he first had for the attainment of arahantship on attaining arahantship that particular intent is allayed whatever discrimination he first had for the attainment of arahantship on attaining arahantship that particular discrimination is allayed so what do you think brahman is this an endless path or one with an end you re right master ananda this is a path with an end and not an endless one then ven malunkyaputta who was ardent resolute went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one it would be good lord if the blessed one would teach me the dhamma in brief so that having heard the dhamma from the blessed one i might dwell alone in seclusion heedful ardent resolute here now malunkyaputta what will i say to the young monks when you aged old elderly along in years come to the last stage of life ask for an admonition in brief lord even though i m aged old elderly along in years come to the last stage of life may the blessed one teach me the dhamma in brief may the one well gone teach me the dhamma in brief it may well be that i ll understand the blessed one s words it may well be that i ll become an heir to the blessed one s words what do you think malunkyaputta the forms cognizable via the eye that are unseen by you that you have never before seen that you don t see and that are not to be seen by you do you have any desire or passion or love there no lord the sounds cognizable via the ear the aromas cognizable via the nose the flavors cognizable via the tongue the tactile sensations cognizable via the body the ideas cognizable via the intellect that are uncognized by you that you have never before cognized that you don t cognize and that are not to be cognized by you do you have any desire or passion or love there no lord then malunkyaputta with regard to phenomena to be seen heard sensed or cognized in reference to the seen there will be only the seen in reference to the heard only the heard in reference to the sensed only the sensed in reference to the cognized only the cognized that is how you should train yourself when for you there will be only the seen in reference to the seen only the heard in reference to the heard only the sensed in reference to the sensed only the cognized in reference to the cognized then malunkyaputta there is no i understand in detail lord the meaning of what the blessed one has said in brief seeing a form mindfulness lapsed attending to the theme of endearing impassioned in mind one feels and remains fastened there one s feelings born of the form grow numerous greed annoyance injure one s mind thus amassing stress one is said to be far from unbinding hearing a sound smelling an aroma tasting a flavor touching a tactile sensation knowing an idea mindfulness lapsed attending to the theme of endearing impassioned in mind one feels and remains fastened there one s feelings born of the idea grow numerous greed annoyance injure one s mind thus amassing stress one is said to be far from unbinding not impassioned with forms seeing a form with mindfulness firm dispassioned in mind one knows and doesn t remain fastened there while one is seeing a form and even experiencing feeling it falls away and doesn t accumulate thus one fares mindfully thus not amassing stress one is said to be in the presence of unbinding not impassioned with sounds not impassioned with aromas not impassioned with flavors not impassioned with tactile sensations not impassioned with ideas knowing an idea with mindfulness firm dispassioned in mind one knows and doesn t remain fastened there while one is knowing an idea and even experiencing feeling it falls away and doesn t accumulate thus one fares mindfully thus not amassing stress one is said to be in the presence of unbinding it s in this way lord that i understand in detail the meaning of what the blessed one said in brief good malunkyaputta very good it s good that you understand in detail this way the meaning of what i said in brief the buddha then repeats the verses it s in this way malunkyaputta that the meaning of what i said in brief should be regarded in detail on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the seeing thus the well instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness disenchanted he grows dispassionate through dispassion he s released with release there s the knowledge released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further form is like a glob of foam feeling a bubble perception a mirage fabrications a banana tree consciousness a magic trick this has been taught by the kinsman of the sun however you observe them appropriately examine them they re empty void to whoever sees them appropriately beginning with the body as taught by the one with profound discernment when abandoned by three things life warmth consciousness form is rejected cast aside when bereft of these it lies thrown away senseless a meal for others that s the way it goes it s a magic trick an idiot s babbling it s said to be a murderer i have heard that on one occasion while the blessed one was on a wandering tour among the the brahman householders of sala heard it said gotama the contemplative the son of the sakyans having gone forth from the sakyan clan on a wandering tour among the kosalans with a large community of monks has arrived at sala and of that master gotama this fine reputation has spread he is indeed a blessed one worthy rightly self awakened consummate in knowledge conduct well gone a knower of the cosmos an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed teacher of human divine beings awakened blessed he has made known having realized it through direct knowledge this world with its devas maras brahmas its generations with their contemplatives brahmans their rulers common people has explained the dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end has expounded the holy life both in its particulars in its essence entirely perfect pure it is good to see such a worthy one so the brahman householders of sala went to the blessed one on arrival some of them bowing down to him sat to one side some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies sat to one side some of them placing their hands palm to palm over the heart in his direction sat to one side some of them announcing their name and clan in his presence sat to one side some of them remaining silent sat to one side as they were sitting there the brahman householders of sala said to the blessed one what is the reason master gotama what is the condition whereby some beings here with the break up of the body after death reappear in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell and what is the reason what is the condition whereby some beings here with the break up of the body after death reappear in the good destinations in the heavenly world householders it s by reason of un dhamma conduct dissonant we don t understand the detailed meaning of master gotama s brief statement the detailed meaning of what he hasn t analyzed it would be good if master gotama would teach the dhamma so that we would understand the detailed meaning of master gotama s brief statement the detailed meaning of what he hasn t analyzed very well in that case householders listen pay careful attention i will speak as you say master the brahman householders of sala responded to the blessed one the blessed one said householders there are three sorts of un dhamma conduct dissonant conduct with the body four sorts of un dhamma conduct dissonant conduct with speech and three sorts of un dhamma conduct dissonant conduct with the mind unskillful bodily action and how are there three sorts of un dhamma conduct dissonant conduct with the body there is the case where a certain person takes life is brutal bloody handed devoted to killing slaying showing no mercy to living beings he takes what is not given he takes in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them he engages in sensual misconduct he gets sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another man this is how there are three sorts of un dhamma conduct dissonant conduct with the body unskillful verbal action and how are there four sorts of un dhamma conduct dissonant conduct with speech there is the case where a certain person engages in false speech when he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty i e a royal court proceeding if he is asked as a witness come tell good man what you know if he doesn t know he says i know if he does know he says i don t know if he hasn t seen he says i have seen if he has seen he says i haven t seen thus he consciously tells lies for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of a certain reward he engages in divisive speech he engages in abusive speech he speaks words that are harsh cutting bitter to others abusive of others provoking anger and destroying concentration he engages in idle chatter he speaks out of season speaks what isn t factual what isn t in accordance with the goal the dhamma the vinaya words that are not worth treasuring this is how there are four sorts of un dhamma conduct dissonant conduct with speech unskillful mental action and how are there three sorts of un dhamma conduct dissonant conduct with the mind there is the case where a certain person is covetous he covets the belongings of others thinking o that what belongs to others would be mine he bears ill will corrupt in the resolves of his heart may these beings be killed or cut apart or crushed or destroyed or may they not exist at all he has wrong view is warped in the way he sees things there is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed there is no fruit or result of good or bad actions there is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no contemplatives or brahmans who faring rightly practicing rightly proclaim this world the next after having directly known realized it for themselves this is how there are three sorts of un dhamma conduct dissonant conduct with the mind it s by reason of this un dhamma conduct dissonant conduct that some beings here with the break up of the body after death re appear in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell householders there are three sorts of dhamma conduct harmonious conduct with the body four sorts of dhamma conduct harmonious conduct with speech and three sorts of dhamma conduct harmonious conduct with the mind skillful bodily action and how are there three sorts of dhamma conduct harmonious conduct with the body there is the case where a certain person abandoning the taking of life abstains from the taking of life he dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beings abandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not given he doesn t take in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them abandoning sensual misconduct he abstains from sensual misconduct he doesn t get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another man this is how there are three sorts of dhamma conduct harmonious conduct with the body skillful verbal action and how are there three sorts of dhamma conduct harmonious conduct with speech there is the case where a certain person abandoning false speech abstains from false speech when he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness come tell good man what you know if he doesn t know he says i don t know if he does know he says i know if he hasn t seen he says i haven t seen if he has seen he says i have seen thus he doesn t consciously tell a lie for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of any reward abandoning false speech he abstains from false speech he speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the world abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech what he has heard here he doesn t tell there to break those people apart from these people here what he has heard there he doesn t tell here to break these people apart from those people there thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concord abandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speech he speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing pleasing to people at large abandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatter he speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the dhamma the vinaya he speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goal this is how there are four sorts of dhamma conduct harmonious conduct with speech skillful mental action and how are there three sorts of dhamma conduct harmonious conduct with the mind there is the case where a certain person is not covetous he doesn t covet the belongings of others thinking o that what belongs to others would be mine he bears no ill will and is not corrupt in the resolves of his heart he thinks may these beings be free from animosity free from oppression free from trouble and may they look after themselves with ease he has right view and is not warped in the way he sees things there is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed there are fruits results of good bad actions there is this world the next world there is mother father there are spontaneously reborn beings there are contemplatives brahmans who faring rightly practicing rightly proclaim this world the next after having directly known realized it for themselves this is how there are three sorts of dhamma conduct harmonious conduct with the mind it s by reason of this dhamma conduct harmonious conduct that some beings here with the break up of the body after death re appear in the good destinations in the heavenly world householders if one a person of dhamma conduct harmonious conduct should wish o if i with the break up of the body after death were to reappear among well to do noble warriors it is possible that one with the break up of the body after death would appear among well to do noble warriors why is that because one is a person of dhamma conduct harmonious conduct if one a person of dhamma conduct harmonious conduct should wish o if i with the break up of the body after death were to reappear among well to do brahmans it is possible that one with the break up of the body after death would appear among well to do brahmans why is that because one is a person of dhamma conduct harmonious conduct if one a person of dhamma

the mental fermentations would enter remain in the fermentation free awareness release discernment release having directly known and realized them for oneself right in the here now when this was said the brahman householders of sala said to the blessed one magnificent master gotama magnificent just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has master gotama through many lines of reasoning made the dhamma clear we go to master gotama for refuge to the dhamma to the community of monks may master gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge from this day forward for life dependent co arisingi have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was living among the kurus now the the buddha don t say that ananda don t say that deep is this dependent co arising and deep its appearance it s because of not understanding and not penetrating this dhamma that this generation is like a tangled skein a knotted ball of string like matted rushes and reeds and does not go beyond transmigration beyond the planes of deprivation woe and bad destinations if one is asked is there a demonstrable requisite condition for aging and death one should answer there is if one is asked from what requisite condition do aging and death come one should say aging and death come from birth as their requisite condition if one is asked is there a demonstrable requisite condition for birth one should answer there is if one is asked from what requisite condition does birth come one should say birth comes from becoming as its requisite condition if one is asked is there a demonstrable requisite condition for becoming one should answer there is if one is asked from what requisite condition does becoming come one should say becoming comes from clinging as its requisite condition if one is asked is there a demonstrable requisite condition for clinging one should answer there is if one is asked from what requisite condition does clinging come one should say clinging comes from craving as its requisite condition if one is asked is there a demonstrable requisite condition for craving one should answer there is if one is asked from what requisite condition does craving come one should say craving comes from feeling as its requisite condition if one is asked is there a demonstrable requisite condition for feeling one should answer there is if one is asked from what requisite condition does feeling come one should say feeling comes from contact as its requisite condition if one is asked is there a demonstrable requisite condition for contact one should answer there is if one is asked from what requisite condition does contact come one should say contact comes from name and form as its requisite condition if one is asked is there a demonstrable requisite condition for name and form one should answer there is if one is asked from what requisite condition does name and form come one should say name and form comes from consciousness as its requisite condition if one is asked is there a demonstrable requisite condition for consciousness one should answer there is if one is asked from what requisite condition does consciousness come one should say consciousness comes from name and form as its requisite condition thus ananda from name and form as a requisite condition comes consciousness from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name and form from name and form as a requisite condition comes contact from contact as a requisite condition comes feeling from feeling as a requisite condition comes craving from craving as a requisite condition comes clinging from clinging as a requisite condition comes becoming from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth from birth as a requisite condition aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair come into play such is the origination of this entire mass of stress aging and death from birth as a requisite condition come aging and death thus it has been said and this is the way to understand how from birth as a requisite condition come aging and death if there were no birth at all in any way of anything anywhere i e of devas in the state of devas of celestials in the state of celestials of spirits in the state of spirits of demons in the state of demons of human beings in the human state of quadrupeds in the state of quadrupeds of birds in the state of birds of snakes in the state of snakes or of any being in its own state in the utter absence of birth from the cessation of birth would aging and death be discerned no lord thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for aging and death i e birth birth from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth thus it has been said and this is the way to understand how from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth if there were no becoming at all in any way of anything anywhere i e sensual becoming form becoming or formless becoming in the utter absence of becoming from the cessation of becoming would birth be discerned no lord thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for birth i e becoming becoming from clinging as a requisite condition comes becoming thus it has been said and this is the way to understand how from clinging as a requisite condition comes becoming if there were no clinging at all in any way of anything anywhere i e clinging to sensuality clinging to precepts and practices clinging to views or clinging to doctrines of the self in the utter absence of clinging from the cessation of clinging would becoming be discerned no lord thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for becoming i e clinging clinging from craving as a requisite condition comes clinging thus it has been said and this is the way to understand how from craving as a requisite condition comes clinging if there were no craving at all in any way of anything anywhere i e craving for sensuality craving for becoming craving for no becoming in the utter absence of craving from the cessation of craving would clinging be discerned no lord thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for clinging i e craving craving from feeling as a requisite condition comes craving thus it has been said and this is the way to understand how from feeling as a requisite condition comes craving if there were no feeling at all in any way of anything anywhere i e feeling born of contact at the eye feeling born of contact at the ear feeling born of contact at the nose feeling born of contact at the tongue feeling born of contact at the body or feeling born of contact at the intellect in the utter absence of feeling from the cessation of feeling would craving be discerned no lord thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for craving i e feeling dependent on craving now craving is dependent on feeling seeking is dependent on craving acquisition is dependent on seeking ascertainment is dependent on acquisition desire and passion is dependent on ascertainment attachment is dependent on desire and passion possessiveness is dependent on attachment stinginess is dependent on possessiveness defensiveness is dependent on stinginess and because of defensiveness dependent on defensiveness various evil unskillful phenomena come into play the taking up of sticks and knives conflicts quarrels and disputes accusations divisive speech and lies and this is the way to understand how it is that because of defensiveness various evil unskillful phenomena come into play the taking up of sticks and knives conflicts quarrels and disputes accusations divisive speech and lies if there were no defensiveness at all in any way of anything anywhere in the utter absence of defensiveness from the cessation of defensiveness would various evil unskillful phenomena the taking up of sticks and knives conflicts quarrels and disputes accusations divisive speech and lies come into play no lord thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for the coming into play of various evil unskillful phenomena the taking up of sticks and knives conflicts quarrels and disputes accusations divisive speech and lies i e defensiveness defensiveness is dependent on stinginess thus it has been said and this is the way to understand how defensiveness is dependent on stinginess if there were no stinginess at all in any way of anything anywhere in the utter absence of stinginess from the cessation of stinginess would defensiveness be discerned no lord thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for defensiveness i e stinginess similarly back through the chain of conditions stinginess attachment possessiveness desire and passion ascertainment acquisition and seeking seeking is dependent on craving thus it has been said and this is the way to understand how seeking is dependent on craving if there were no craving at all in any way of anything anywhere i e craving for sensuality craving for becoming craving for no becoming in the utter absence of craving from the cessation of craving would seeking be discerned no lord thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for seeking i e craving thus ananda these two phenomena the chain of conditions leading from craving to birth aging and death and the chain of conditions leading from craving to quarrels etc as a duality flow back into one place at feeling feeling from contact as a requisite condition comes feeling thus it has been said and this is the way to understand how from contact as a requisite condition comes feeling if there were no contact at all in any way of anything anywhere i e contact at the eye contact at the ear contact at the nose contact at the tongue contact at the body or contact at the intellect in the utter absence of contact from the cessation of contact would feeling be discerned no lord thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for feeling i e contact contact from name form as a requisite condition comes contact thus it has been said and this is the way to understand how from name form as a requisite condition comes contact if the qualities traits themes indicators by which there is a description of name group mental activity were all absent would designation contact with regard to the form group the physical properties be discerned no lord if the permutations signs themes and indicators by which there is a description of form group were all absent would resistance contact with regard to the name group be discerned no lord if the permutations signs themes and indicators by which there is a description of name group and form group were all absent would designation contact or resistance contact be discerned no lord thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for contact i e name and form name and form from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name and form thus it has been said and this is the way to understand how from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name and form if consciousness were not to descend into the mother s womb would name and form take shape in the womb no lord if after descending into the womb consciousness were to depart would name and form be produced for this world no lord if the consciousness of the young boy or girl were to be cut off would name and form ripen grow and reach maturity no lord thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for name and form i e consciousness consciousness from name and form as a requisite condition comes consciousness thus it has been said and this is the way to understand how from name and form as a requisite condition comes consciousness if consciousness were not to gain a foothold in name and form would a coming into play of the origination of birth aging death and stress in the future be discerned no lord thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for consciousness i e name and form this is the extent to which there is birth aging death passing away and re arising this is the extent to which there are means of designation expression and delineation this is the extent to which the sphere of discernment extends the extent to which the cycle revolves for the manifesting discernibility of this world i e name and form together with consciousness delineations of a self to what extent ananda does one delineate when delineating a self either delineating a self possessed of form and finite one delineates that my self is possessed of form and finite or delineating a self possessed of form and infinite one delineates that my self is possessed of form and infinite or delineating a self formless and finite one delineates that my self is formless and finite or delineating a self formless and infinite one delineates that my self is formless and infinite now the one who when delineating a self delineates it as possessed of form and finite either delineates it as possessed of form and finite in the present or of such a nature that it will naturally become possessed of form and finite in the future after death or he believes that although it is not yet that way i will convert it into being that way this being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and finite obsesses him the one who when delineating a self delineates it as possessed of form and infinite either delineates it as possessed of form and infinite in the present or of such a nature that it will naturally become possessed of form and infinite in the future after death or he believes that although it is not yet that way i will convert it into being that way this being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and infinite obsesses him the one who when delineating a self delineates it as formless and finite either delineates it as formless and finite in the present or of such a nature that it will naturally become formless and finite in the future after death or he believes that although it is not yet that way i will convert it into being that way this being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self formless and finite obsesses him the one who when delineating a self delineates it as formless and infinite either delineates it as formless and infinite in the present or of such a nature that it will naturally become formless and infinite in the future after death or he believes that although it is not yet that way i will convert it into being that way this being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self formless and infinite obsesses him non delineations of a self to what extent ananda does one not delineate when not delineating a self either not delineating a self possessed of form and finite one does not delineate that my self is possessed of form and finite or not delineating a self possessed of form and infinite one does not delineate that my self is possessed of form and infinite or not delineating a self formless and finite one does not delineate that my self is formless and finite or not delineating a self formless and infinite one does not delineate that my self is formless and infinite now the one who when not delineating a self does not delineate it as possessed of form and finite does not delineate it as possessed of form and finite in the present nor does he delineate it as of such a nature that it will naturally become possessed of form and finite in the future after death nor does he believe that although it is not yet that way i will convert it into being that way this being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and finite does not obsess him the one who when not delineating a self does not delineate it as possessed of form and infinite does not delineate it as possessed of form and infinite in the present nor does he delineate it as of such a nature that it will naturally become possessed of form and infinite in the future after death nor does he believe that although it is not yet that way i will convert it into being that way this being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and infinite does not obsess him the one who when not delineating a self does not delineate it as formless and finite does not delineate it as formless and finite in the present nor does he delineate it as of such a nature that it will naturally become formless and finite in the future after death nor does he believe that although it is not yet that way i will convert it into being that way this being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self formless and finite does not obsess him the one who when not delineating a self does not delineate it as formless and infinite does not delineate it as formless and infinite in the present nor does he delineate it as of such a nature that it will naturally become formless and infinite in the future after death nor does he believe that although it is not yet that way i will convert it into being that way this being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self formless and infinite does not obsess him assumptions of a self to what extent ananda does one assume when assuming a self assuming feeling to be the self one assumes that feeling is my self or feeling is not my self my self is oblivious to feeling or neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious to feeling but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling now one who says feeling is my self should be addressed as follows now a feeling of pleasure is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessation a feeling of pain is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessation a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessation having sensed a feeling of pleasure as my self then with the cessation of one s very own feeling of pleasure my self has perished having sensed a feeling of pain as my self then with the cessation of one s very own feeling of pain my self has perished having sensed a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain as my self then with the cessation of one s very own feeling of neither pleasure nor pain my self has perished thus he assumes assuming in the immediate present a self inconstant entangled in pleasure and pain subject to arising and passing away he who says feeling is my self thus in this manner ananda one does not see fit to assume feeling to be the self as for the person who says feeling is not the self my self is oblivious to feeling he should be addressed as follows my friend where nothing whatsoever is sensed experienced at all would there be the thought i am no lord thus in this manner ananda one does not see fit to assume that feeling is not my self my self is oblivious to feeling as for the person who says neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious to feeling but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling he should be addressed as follows my friend should feelings altogether and every way stop without remainder then with feeling completely not existing owing to the cessation of feeling would there be the thought i am no lord thus in this manner ananda one does not see fit to assume that neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious to feeling but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling now ananda in as far as a monk does not assume feeling to be the self nor the self as oblivious nor that my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling then not assuming in this way he is not sustained by anything does not cling to anything in the world unsustained he is not agitated unagitated he is totally unbound right within he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world if anyone were to say with regard to a monk whose mind is thus released that the tathagata exists after death is his view that would be mistaken that the tathagata does not exist after death that the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death that the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death is his view that would be mistaken why having directly known the extent of designation and the extent of the objects of designation the extent of expression and the extent of the objects of expression the extent of description and the extent of the objects of description the extent of discernment and the extent of the objects of discernment the extent to which the cycle revolves having directly known that the monk is released to say that ananda there are these seven stations of consciousness and two spheres which seven there are beings with diversity of body and diversity of perception such as human beings some devas and some beings in the lower realms this is the first station of consciousness there are beings with diversity of body and singularity of perception such as the devas of the brahma hosts generated by the first jhana and some beings in the four realms of deprivation this is the second station of consciousness there are beings with singularity of body and diversity of perception such as the radiant devas this is the third station of consciousness there are beings with singularity of body and singularity of perception such as the beautifully lustrous devas this is the fourth station of consciousness there are beings who with the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving infinite space arrive at the dimension of the infinitude of space this is the fifth station of consciousness there are beings who with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space perceiving infinite consciousness arrive at the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness this is the sixth station of consciousness there are beings who with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness perceiving there is nothing arrive at the dimension of nothingness this is the seventh station of consciousness the dimension of non percipient beings and second the dimension of neither perception nor non perception these are the two spheres now as for the first station of consciousness beings with diversity of body and diversity of perception such as human beings some devas and some beings in the lower realms if one discerns that station of consciousness discerns its origination discerns its passing away discerns its allure discerns its drawbacks discerns the escape from it would it be proper by means of that discernment to take delight there no lord similarly with each of the remaining stations of consciousness and two spheres ananda there are these eight emancipations which eight possessed of form one sees forms this is the first emancipation not percipient of form internally one sees forms externally this is the second emancipation one is intent only on the beautiful this is the third emancipation with the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving infinite space one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space this is the fourth emancipation with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space perceiving infinite consciousness one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness this is the fifth emancipation with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness perceiving there is nothing one enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness this is the sixth emancipation with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness one enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non perception this is the seventh emancipation with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception one enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling this is the eighth emancipation now when a monk attains these eight emancipations in forward order in reverse order in forward and reverse order when he attains them and emerges from them wherever he wants however he wants and for as long as he wants when through the ending of the mental fermentations he enters and remains in the fermentation free awareness release and discernment release having directly known it and realized it in the here and now he is said to be a monk released in both ways and as for another release in both ways higher or more sublime than this there is none that is what the blessed one said gratified ven ananda delighted in the blessed one s words punnika the brahman punnika the brahman punnika the brahman brahmai the four bonds monks there are four bonds i the bond of sensual pleasure and which monks is the bond of sensual pleasure here monks someone does not understand as it really is the arising the subsiding the sweetness the wretchedness and the leaving behind of sensual pleasures for one not understanding as it really is the arising the subsiding the sweetness the wretchedness and the leaving behind of sensual pleasures who with respect to sensual pleasure is obsessed with passion for sensual pleasure delight in sensual pleasure affection for sensual pleasure intoxication with sensual pleasure thirst for sensual pleasure fever for sensual pleasure attachment to sensual pleasure craving for sensual pleasure this monks is called the bond of sensual pleasure thus the bond of sensual pleasure i the bond of being and how is there the bond of being here monks someone does not understand as it really is the arising the subsiding the sweetness the wretchedness and the leaving behind of modes of being for one not understanding as it really is the arising the subsiding the sweetness the wretchedness and the leaving behind of modes of being who with respect to being is obsessed with passion for being delight in being affection for being intoxication with being thirst for being fever for being attachment to being craving for being this monks is called the bond of being thus the bond of sensual delight and the bond of being i the bond of opinions and how is there the bond of opinions here monks someone does not understand as it really is the arising the subsiding the sweetness the wretchedness and the leaving behind of opinions for one not understanding as it really is the arising the subsiding the sweetness the wretchedness and the leaving behind of modes of opinion who with respect to opinion is obsessed with passion for opinion delight in opinion affection for opinion intoxication with opinion thirst for opinion fever for opinion attachment to opinion craving for opinion this monks is called the bond of opinion thus the bond of sensual pleasure the bond of being and the bond of opinion i the bond of ignorance and how is there the bond of ignorance here monks someone does not understand as it really is the arising the subsiding the sweetness the wretchedness and the leaving behind of the six fields of sense contact for one not understanding as it really is the arising the subsiding the sweetness the wretchedness and the leaving behind of the six fields of sense contact when with respect to ignorance about the six fields of sense contact one is obsessed with the denial of knowledge ii the four releases from bondage monks there are four releases from bondage ii the release from the bondage of the bond of sensual pleasure and which monks is the release from the bondage of the bond of sensual pleasure here monks someone understands as it really is the arising the subsiding the sweetness the wretchedness and the leaving behind of sensual pleasures for one who knows as it really is the arising the subsiding the sweetness the wretchedness and the leaving behind of sensual pleasures who with respect to sensual pleasure is not obsessed with passion for sensual pleasure delight in sensual pleasure affection for sensual pleasure intoxication with sensual pleasure thirst for sensual pleasure fever for sensual pleasure attachment to sensual pleasure craving for sensual pleasure this monks is called the release from bondage of the bond of sensual pleasure thus the release from bondage of the bond of sensual pleasure ii the release from the bondage of the bond of being and how is there the release from the bondage of the bond of being here monks someone understands as it really is the arising the subsiding the sweetness the wretchedness and the leaving behind of modes of being for one who understands as it really is the arising the subsiding the sweetness the wretchedness and the leaving behind of modes of being who with respect to being is not obsessed with passion for being delight in being affection for being intoxication with being thirst for being fever for being attachment to being craving for being this monks is called the release from bondage of the bond of being thus the release from the bondage of the bond of sensual pleasure and the release from the bondage of the bond of being ii the release from the bondage of the bond of opinions and how is there the release from the bondage of the bond of opinions here monks someone understands as it really is the arising the subsiding the sweetness the wretchedness and the leaving behind of opinions for one understanding as it really is the arising the subsiding the sweetness the wretchedness and the leaving behind of opinions who with respect to opinions is not obsessed with passion for opinions delight in opinions affection for opinions intoxication with opinions thirst for opinions fever for opinions attachment to opinions craving for opinions this monks is called the release from bondage of the bond of opinions thus the release from the bondage of the bond of sensual pleasure the release from the bondage of the bond of being and the release from the bondage of the bond of opinions ii the release from the bondage of the bond of ignorance and how is there the release from the bondage of the bond of ignorance here monks someone understands as it really is the arising the subsiding the sweetness the wretchedness and the leaving behind of the six spheres of sense contact for one understanding as it really is the arising the subsiding the sweetness the wretchedness and the leaving behind of the six spheres of sense contact with respect to ignorance about the six fields of sense contact one is not obsessed with not understanding this monks is called the release from the bondage of the bond of ignorance thus the release from the bondage of the bond of sensual pleasure the release from the bondage of the bond of being the release from the bondage of the bond of opinions and the release from the bondage of the bond of ignorance released from the bondage of evil unwholesome mental phenomena defiling leading to renewed being painful having suffering as fruit and stretching forth to future birth old age and death because of that it is called peace or rest from bondage iii concluding summary verses bound by the bond of sensual pleasure and also by the bond of being bound by the bond of opinions and enveloped by ignorance beings go to wandering on but those fully understanding sensual pleasure and in every way the bond of being dispelling the bond of opinions and detached from ignorance are released from all bonds they indeed are the wise ones going beyond bonds i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery at that time ven s riputta was with a variety of approaches instructing urging rousing encouraging ven bhaddiya the dwarf with dhamma talk as ven bhaddiya the dwarf was with a variety of approaches being instructed urged roused encouraged by ven s riputta with dhamma talk his mind through lack of clinging sustenance was released from the effluents the blessed one saw that as ven bhaddiya the dwarf was with a variety of approaches being instructed urged roused encouraged by ven s riputta with dhamma talk his mind through lack of clinging sustenance was released from the effluents then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed above below everywhere released he doesn t focus on i am this monks i will teach you the nine step by step dwelling attainments listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said and what monks are the nine step by step dwelling attainments wherever sensual resolves cease and those who repeatedly are stopping sensual resolves dwell surely i tell you by that factor those venerable ones are free from hunger unbound having crossed over gone to the far shore now if someone should say where do sensual resolves cease and where do those who repeatedly are stopping sensual resolves dwell i don t know that i don t see that he should be told there is the case friend where a monk quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful mental qualities enters remains in the first jh na rapture pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought evaluation that is where sensual resolves cease and where those who repeatedly are stopping sensual resolves dwell surely a person without guile or deceit saying very good would delight in approve of that statement delighting in approving of that statement paying homage raising his hands palm to palm over his heart he would honor it wherever directed thoughts evaluations cease and those who repeatedly are stopping directed thoughts evaluations dwell surely i tell you by that factor those venerable ones are free from hunger unbound having crossed over gone to the far shore now if someone should say where do directed thoughts evaluations cease and where do those who repeatedly are stopping directed thoughts evaluations dwell i don t know that i don t see that he should be told there is the case friend where a monk with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations enters remains in the second jh na rapture pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance that is where directed thoughts evaluations cease and where those who repeatedly are stopping directed thoughts evaluations dwell surely a person without guile or deceit saying very good would delight in approve of that statement delighting in approving of that statement paying homage raising his hands palm to palm over his heart he would honor it wherever rapture ceases and those who repeatedly are stopping rapture dwell surely i tell you by that factor those venerable ones are free from hunger unbound having crossed over gone to the far shore now if someone should say where does rapture cease and where do those who repeatedly are stopping rapture dwell i don t know that i don t see that he should be told there is the case friend where a monk with the fading of rapture remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jh na of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding that is where rapture ceases and where those who repeatedly are stopping rapture dwell surely a person without guile or deceit saying very good would delight in approve of that statement delighting in approving of that statement paying homage raising his hands palm to palm over his heart he would honor it wherever the pleasure of equanimity now if someone should say where does the pleasure of equanimity cease and where do those who repeatedly are stopping the pleasure of equanimity dwell i don t know that i don t see that he should be told there is the case friend where a monk with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of joy distress enters remains in the fourth jh na purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain that is where the pleasure of equanimity ceases and where those who repeatedly are stopping the pleasure of equanimity dwell surely a person without guile or deceit saying very good would delight in approve of that statement delighting in approving of that statement paying homage raising his hands palm to palm over his heart he would honor it wherever the perception of form ceases and those who repeatedly are stopping the perception of form dwell surely i tell you by that factor those venerable ones are free from hunger unbound having crossed over gone to the far shore now if someone should say where does the perception of form cease and where do those who repeatedly are stopping the perception of form dwell i don t know that i don t see that he should be told there is the case friend where a monk with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of

those who repeatedly are stopping the perception of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception dwell i don t know that i don t see that he should be told there is the case friend where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception enters remains in the cessation of perception feeling these monks are the nine step by step dwelling attainments i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion a large number of boys on the road between s vatth jeta s grove were catching fish then early in the morning the blessed one adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl robes went into s vatth for alms he saw the large number of boys on the road between s vatth jeta s grove catching little fish seeing them he went up to them and on arrival said to them boys do you fear pain do you dislike pain yes lord we fear pain we dislike pain then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed if you fear pain if you dislike pain don t anywhere do an evil deed in open or in secret if you re doing or will do an evil deed you won t escape pain catching up as you run away i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion ven subh ti was sitting not far from the blessed one his legs crossed his body held erect having attained a concentration free from directed thought the blessed one saw ven subh ti sitting not far away his legs crossed his body held erect having attained a concentration free from directed thought then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed whose thoughts are vaporized well dealt with within dwelling at when this was said not a valid question the blessed one said i don t say feeds if i were to say feeds then who feeds on the consciousness nutriment would be a valid question but i don t say that when i don t say that the valid question is consciousness nutriment for what and the valid answer is consciousness nutriment for the production of future coming into being when that has come into being and exists then the six sense media from the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact lord who makes contact not a valid question the blessed one said i don t say makes contact if i were to say makes contact then who makes contact would be a valid question but i don t say that when i don t say that the valid question is from what as a requisite condition comes contact and the valid answer is from the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact from contact as a requisite condition comes feeling lord who feels not a valid question the blessed one said i don t say feels if i were to say feels then who feels would be a valid question but i don t say that when i don t say that the valid question is from what as a requisite condition comes feeling and the valid answer is from contact as a requisite condition comes feeling from feeling as a requisite condition comes craving lord who craves not a valid question the blessed one said i don t say craves if i were to say craves then who craves would be a valid question but i don t say that when i don t say that the valid question is from what as a requisite condition comes craving and the valid answer is from feeling as a requisite condition comes craving from craving as a requisite condition comes clinging sustenance lord who clings not a valid question the blessed one said i don t say clings if i were to say clings then who clings would be a valid question but i don t say that when i don t say that the valid question is from what as a requisite condition comes clinging and the valid answer is from craving as a requisite condition comes clinging from clinging as a requisite condition comes becoming from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth from birth as a requisite condition then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair come into play such is the origination of this entire mass of stress suffering now from the remainderless fading cessation of the six sense media i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in upavattana the mallan sal grove near kusinar the blessed one saw those many monks staying in wilderness huts high strung rowdy flighty talkative of loose words muddled mindfulness unalert unconcentrated their minds scattered their faculties left wide open then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed by leaving your body unprotected being immersed in wrong view conquered by sloth torpor you go under m ra s sway therefore with protected mind ranging in right resolve honoring right view knowing rise fall conquering sloth torpor a monk leaves all bad destinations behind see also mn i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in lord it s not that i take it on conviction in the blessed one that the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment when developed pursued gains a footing in the deathless has the deathless as its goal consummation those who have not known seen penetrated realized or attained it by means of discernment would have to take it on conviction in others that the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment when developed pursued gains a footing in the deathless has the deathless as its goal consummation whereas those who have known seen penetrated realized attained it by means of discernment would have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment when developed pursued gains a footing in the deathless has the deathless as its goal consummation and as for me i have known seen penetrated realized attained it by means of discernment i have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment when developed pursued gains a footing in the deathless has the deathless as its goal consummation excellent sariputta excellent those who have not known seen penetrated realized or attained it by means of discernment would have to take it on conviction in others that the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment when developed pursued gains a footing in the deathless has the deathless as its goal consummation whereas those who have known seen penetrated realized attained it by means of discernment would have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment when developed pursued gains a footing in the deathless has the deathless as its goal consummation thus have i heard on one occasion the exalted one was dwelling in the bamboo grove the squirrels sanctuary near now at that time young then the exalted one having robed himself in the forenoon took bowl and robe and entered rajagaha for alms now he saw young sigala worshipping thus and spoke to him as follows wherefore do you young householder rising early in the morning departing from rajagaha with wet clothes and wet hair worship with joined hands these various quarters the east the south the west the north the nadir and the zenith my father lord while dying said to me the six quarters dear son you shall worship and i lord respecting revering reverencing and honoring my father s word rise early in the morning and leaving rajagaha with wet clothes and wet hair worship with joined hands these six quarters it is not thus young householder the six quarters should be worshipped in the discipline of the noble how then lord should the six quarters be worshipped in the discipline of the noble it is well lord if the exalted one would teach the doctrine to me showing how the six quarters should be worshipped in the discipline of the noble well young householder listen and bear it well in mind i shall speak very good lord responded young sigala and the exalted one spoke as follows inasmuch young householder as the noble disciple thus spoke the exalted one and when the master had thus spoken he spoke yet again killing stealing lying and adultery these four evils the wise never praise but inasmuch as the noble disciple is not led by desire anger ignorance and fear he commits no evil thus spoke the exalted one and when the master had thus spoken he spoke yet again i loss of wealth ii increase of quarrels iii susceptibility to disease iv earning an evil reputation v shameless exposure of body vi weakening of intellect i he himself is unprotected and unguarded ii his wife and children are unprotected and unguarded iii his property is unprotected and unguarded iv he is suspected of evil deeds i where is there dancing ii where is there singing iii where is there music iv where is there recitation v where is there playing with cymbals vi where is there pot blowing i the winner begets hate ii the loser grieves for lost wealth iii loss of wealth iv his word is not relied upon in a court of law v he is despised by his friends and associates vi he is not sought after for matrimony for people would say he is a gambler and is not fit to look after a wife he does no work saying i that it is extremely cold ii that it is extremely hot iii that it is too late in the evening iv that it is too early in the morning v that he is extremely hungry vi that he is too full living in this way he leaves many duties undone new wealth he does not get and wealth he has acquired dwindles away thus spoke the exalted one and when the master had thus spoken he spoke yet again one is a bottle friend one says friend friend only to one s face one is a friend and an associate only when it is advantageous sleeping till sunrise adultery irascibility malevolence evil companions avarice these six causes ruin a man the man who has evil comrades and friends is given to evil ways to ruin does he fall in both worlds here and the next dice women liquor dancing singing sleeping by day sauntering at unseemly hours evil companions avarice these nine who is drunk poor destitute still thirsty whilst drinking frequents the bars sinks in debt as a stone in water swiftly brings disrepute to his family who by habit sleeps by day and keeps late hours is ever intoxicated and is licentious is not fit to lead a household life who says it is too hot too cold too late and leaves things undone the opportunities for good go past such men but he who does not regard cold or heat any more than a blade of grass and who does his duties manfully does not fall away from happiness from what arise contentions and disputes lamentations and sorrows along with selfishness and conceit and arrogance along with slander from where do these various things arise come tell me this from being too endeared to objects and persons arise contentions and disputes lamentations and sorrows along with avarice selfishness and conceit arrogance and slander contentions and disputes are linked with selfishness and slander is born of contention what are the sources of becoming endeared in the world what are the sources of whatever passions prevail in the world of longings and fulfillments that are man s goal in life desires are the source of becoming endeared to objects and persons in the world also of whatever passions prevail these are the sources of longings and fulfillments that are man s goal in life now what is the source of desire in the world what is the cause of judgments it is pleasant it is unpleasant so people speak in the world and based upon that arises desire having seen the appearing and disappearing of material things a man makes his judgments in the world what is the source of thinking things as pleasant or unpleasant when what is absent are these states not present what is the meaning of appearing and disappearing explain the source of it to me the pleasant and the unpleasant have their source in sense impression when this sense impression is absent these states are not present the idea of appearing and disappearing is produced from this i say what is the source of sense impression from what arises so much grasping by the absence of what is there no selfish attachment by the disappearance of what is sense impression not experienced sense impression is dependent upon the mental and the material grasping has its source in wanting something what not being present there is no selfish attachment by the disappearance of material objects sense impression is not experienced for whom does materiality disappear how do pleasure and discomfort cease to be tell me how it ceases so that i may be satisfied in my mind that i have understood it his perception is not the ordinary kind nor is his perception abnormal what we asked you have explained we now ask another question tell us the answer to it do not some of the learned declare purification of the spirit some of the learned do declare purification of the spirit as the highest but contrary to them some teach a doctrine of annihilation those clever ones declare this to be final liberation without basis of life s fuel remaining knowing that these theorists rely on mere opinions for their statements a sage investigates that upon which they rely having understood and being free from theories he will not dispute with anyone the wise do not enter into any existence then the brahman lady verahaccaani served the venerable udaayii with her own hands with choice foods both hard and soft until he had had enough when he had eaten and withdrawn his hand from the bowl the lady verahaccaani put on her shoes sat down on a high seat covered her head the time will come for that sister he said and getting up from his seat he went on his way well my lady you put on your shoes sat down on a high seat covered your head and said teach me your doctrine recluse but these venerable recluses honor their doctrine they hold it in high esteem very well young man invite the recluse udaayii on my behalf to a meal tomorrow when the venerable udaayii had eaten and withdrawn his hand from the bowl the lady sat down barefoot and bare headed where the eye is sister the arahants declare that weal and woe exist where the eye is absent they declare that weal and woe do not exist jtb ag calls this sutta iii i follow pts numbering and call it iii then vacchagotta the wanderer went to the blessed one and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one master gotama i have heard that gotama the contemplative says this only to me should a gift be given and not to others only to my disciples should a gift be given and not to others only what is given to me bears great fruit and not what is given to others only what is given to my disciples bears great fruit and not what is given to the disciples of others now those who report this are they reporting the master gotama s actual words are they not misrepresenting him with what is unfactual are they answering in line with the dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the dhamma will have grounds for criticizing them for we don t want to misrepresent the master gotama vaccha whoever says this gotama the contemplative says this only to me should a gift be given only what is given to my disciples bears great fruit and not what is given to the disciples of others is not reporting my actual words is misrepresenting me with what is unfactual untrue vaccha whoever prevents another from giving a gift creates three obstructions three impediments which three he creates an obstruction to the merit of the giver an obstruction to the recipient s gains and prior to that he undermines and harms his own self whoever prevents another from giving a gift creates these three obstructions these three impediments which five has he abandoned he has abandoned sensual desire ill will sloth drowsiness restlessness anxiety uncertainty these are the five factors he has abandoned and with which five is he endowed he is endowed with the aggregate of virtue of one beyond training the aggregate of concentration of one beyond training the aggregate of discernment of one beyond training the aggregate of release of one beyond training the aggregate of knowledge vision of release of one beyond training these are the five factors with which he is endowed i tell you what is given to one who has abandoned these five factors and is endowed with these five bears great fruit in a herd of cattleat life is swept along next to nothing its span for one swept on by aging no shelters exist perceiving this danger in death one should do deeds of merit that bring about bliss the buddha one time the buddha was staying near savatthi in jeta s grove at the garden of anathapindika at that time he was seated under the open sky on a night of blinding darkness while oil lamps were burning and also at that time a great number of winged insects were flying around and falling into those oil lamps thus meeting with misfortune meeting with ruin meeting with both misfortune and ruin the buddha saw those great number of winged insects flying around and falling into those oil lamps and then the buddha understanding the meaning of this gave utterance at that moment to this profound utterance rushing up but then too far they miss the point only causing ever newer bonds to grow so obsessed are some by what is seen and heard they fly just like these moths straight into the flames it has been said sire by the blessed one who knows and sees the arahant the fully self enlightened one come monks whatever woman is a mother think of her just as a mother whatever woman is a sister think of her just as a sister whatever woman is a daughter think of her just as a daughter but bhaaradvaaja the heart is fickle it may well be that at times thoughts of desire arise towards those they think of just as mothers just as sisters just as daughters is there any other cause any other reason whereby these young monks youthful and black haired can practice the holy life to the end of their days it has been said sire by the blessed one come monks contemplate this body upwards from the soles of the feet downwards from the top of the head bounded by the skin full of manifold impurities there are in this body hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs intestines mesentery bowels feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears tallow saliva synovic fluid urine well bhaaradvaaja for those monks who train the body morals mind and insight that is easy but for those who do not it is difficult sometimes when a man thinks i will regard this as repulsive he comes to think of it as attractive is there any other cause any other reason whereby those young monks can practice the holy life to the end of their days it has been said sire by the exalted one come monks guard the doors of your sense faculties seeing an object with the eye do not seize hold of either its general appearance or its details because anyone dwelling with the eye faculty uncontrolled could be overwhelmed by cupidity and dejection evil and unwholesome states of mind therefore practice to control the eye faculty guard it and gain control over it wonderful good bhaaradvaaja it is marvelous how well spoken are the words of the blessed one i myself good bhaaradvaaja whenever i enter the inner parts of my palace while staying at savatthi the exalted one said the destruction of the cankers monks is for one who knows and sees i say not for one who does not know and does not see knowing what seeing what does the destruction of the cankers occur such is

other views are inferior therefore he is not free from contention with others in what is seen heard cognized and in ritual observances performed he sees a profit for himself just by laying hold of that view he regards every other view as worthless those skilled in judgment they do not speculate nor pursue any notion doctrines are not accepted by them a true brahmana is beyond does not fall back on views the blessed one silently consented yes good gotama what benefit do you expect from it is like this good gotama the evil deeds that i do in the day i cause to be borne away in the evening and the evil deeds that i do in the night i cause to be borne away in the morning that is the benefit i expect from at these words the brahman sangaarava said to the blessed one excellent the blessed one said greed monks these two bright qualities guard the world which two conscience concern then in the same way when the mind is unprotected bodily actions verbal actions mental actions are unprotected as well one s bodily verbal mental actions get soggy one s bodily verbal mental actions rot when one s bodily actions verbal actions mental actions rot one s death is not auspicious the mode of one s

extent my friend is a monk s vision said to be well purified when a monk discerns as it actually is the origination passing away of the six media of sensory contact my friend it is to that extent that his vision is said to be well purified the first monk dissatisfied with the other monk s answer to his question went to still another monk and on arrival said to him to what extent my friend is a monk s vision said to be well purified when a monk discerns as it actually is the origination passing away of the five clinging aggregates my friend it is to that extent that his vision is said to be well purified the first monk dissatisfied with this monk s answer to his question went to still another monk and on arrival said to him to what extent my friend is a monk s vision said to be well purified when a monk discerns as it actually is the origination passing away of the four great elements earth water wind fire my friend it is to that extent that his vision is said to be well purified the first monk dissatisfied with this monk s answer to his question went to still another monk and on arrival said to him to what extent my friend is a monk s vision said to be well purified when a monk discerns as it actually is that whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation my friend it is to that extent that his vision is said to be well purified the first monk dissatisfied with this monk s answer to his question then went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he reported to the blessed one his conversations with the other monks the blessed one then said the other would say a riddle tree is black my good man like a burnt stump for at the time he saw it that s what the riddle tree was like then the first man dissatisfied with the other man s answer went to still another man who had seen a riddle tree and on arrival said to him what my good man is a riddle tree like the other would say a riddle tree is red my good man like a lump of meat for at the time he saw it that s what the riddle tree was like then the first man dissatisfied with this man s answer went to still another man who had seen a riddle tree and on arrival said to him what my good man is a riddle tree like the other would say a riddle tree is stripped of its bark my good man and has burst pods like an acacia tree for at the time he saw it that s what the riddle tree was like then the first man dissatisfied with this man s answer went to still another man who had seen a riddle tree and on arrival said to him what my good man is a riddle tree like the other would say a riddle tree has thick foliage my good man and gives a dense shade like a banyan for at the time he saw it that s what the riddle tree was like in the same way monk however those intelligent men of integrity were focused when their vision became well purified is the way in which they answered i have given you this simile monk to convey a message the message is this the fortress stands for this body composed of four elements born of mother father nourished with rice barley gruel subject to constant rubbing abrasion to breaking falling apart the six gates stand for the six internal sense media the gatekeeper stands for mindfulness the swift pair of messengers stands for tranquillity when i was seven newly gone forth having conquered with my power the great powerful serpent i was fetching water for my preceptor from the great lake anotatta sariputtaanuruddha sthen ven maha kotthita went to sariputta don t say that my friend maha kotthita with the remainderless stopping fading of the six contact media is it the case that there is not anything else sariputta don t say that my friend maha kotthita is it the case that there both is is not anything else sariputta don t say that my friend maha kotthita is it the case that there neither is nor is not anything else sariputta don t say that my friend maha kotthita being asked if with the remainderless stopping fading of the six contact media there is anything else you say don t say that my friend being asked if there is not anything else there both is is not anything else there neither is nor is not anything else you say don t say that my friend now how is the meaning of your words to be understood sariputta the statement with the remainderless stopping fading of the six contact media vision hearing smell taste touch intellection is it the case that there is anything else objectifies non objectification i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion ven c a panthaka was sitting not far from the blessed one his legs crossed his body held erect with mindfulness established to the fore the blessed one saw ven c a panthaka sitting not far away his legs crossed his body held erect with mindfulness established to the fore then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed with steady body steady awareness whether standing sitting or lying down monks these five future dangers are just enough when considered for a monk heedful ardent and resolute to live for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized which five there is the case where a monk reminds himself of this at present i am young black haired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life the time will come though when this body is beset by old age when one is overcome with old age and decay it is not easy to pay attention to the buddha s teachings it is not easy to reside in isolated forest or wilderness dwellings before this unwelcome disagreeable displeasing thing happens let me first make an effort for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized so that endowed with that dhamma i will live in peace even when old this is the first future danger that is just enough when considered for a monk heedful ardent and resolute to live for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized furthermore the monk reminds himself of this at present i am free from illness and discomfort endowed with good digestion not too cold not too hot of medium strength and tolerance the time will come though when this body is beset with illness when one is overcome with illness it is not easy to pay attention to the buddha s teachings it is not easy to reside in isolated forest or wilderness dwellings before this unwelcome disagreeable displeasing thing happens let me first make an effort for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized so that endowed with that dhamma i will live in peace even when ill this is the second future danger that is just enough when considered for a monk heedful ardent and resolute to live for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized furthermore the monk reminds himself of this at present food is plentiful alms are easy to come by it is easy to maintain oneself by gleanings and patronage the time will come though when there is famine food is scarce alms are hard to come by and it is not easy to maintain oneself by gleanings and patronage when there is famine people will congregate where food is plentiful there they will live packed and crowded together when one is living packed and crowded together it is not easy to pay attention to the buddha s teachings it is not easy to reside in isolated forest or wilderness dwellings before this unwelcome disagreeable displeasing thing happens let me first make an effort for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized so that endowed with that dhamma i will live in peace even when there is famine this is the third future danger that is just enough when considered for a monk heedful ardent and resolute to live for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized furthermore the monk reminds himself of this at present people are in harmony on friendly terms without quarreling like milk mixed with water viewing one another with eyes of affection the time will come though when there is danger and an invasion of savage tribes taking power they will surround the countryside when there is danger people will congregate where it is safe there they will live packed and crowded together when one is living packed and crowded together it is not easy to pay attention to the buddha s teachings it is not easy to reside in isolated forest or wilderness dwellings before this unwelcome disagreeable displeasing thing happens let me first make an effort for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized so that endowed with that dhamma i will live in peace even when there is danger this is the fourth future danger that is just enough when considered for a monk heedful ardent and resolute to live for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized furthermore the monk reminds himself of this at present the sangha in harmony on friendly terms without quarreling lives in comfort with a single recitation the time will come though when the sangha splits when the sangha is split it is not easy to pay attention to the buddha s teachings it is not easy to reside in isolated forest or wilderness dwellings before this unwelcome disagreeable displeasing thing happens let me first make an effort for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized so that endowed with that dhamma i will live in peace even when the sangha is split this is the fifth future danger that is just enough when considered for a monk heedful ardent and resolute to live for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized these are the five future dangers that are just enough when considered for a monk heedful ardent and resolute to live for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized i

of a person of integrity furthermore a person of no integrity is a wilderness dweller but a person of integrity notices it s not through being a wilderness dweller that the quality of greed goes to its end it s not through being a wilderness dweller that the quality of aversion the quality of delusion goes to its end even though one is not a wilderness dweller if practicing the dhamma in line with the dhamma practicing masterfully he is one who follows the dhamma he is to be honored for that praised for that so giving priority just to the practice he neither exalts himself for being a wilderness dweller nor disparages others this is the quality of a person of integrity furthermore a person of no integrity is one who wears robes of thrown away rags an alms goer one who dwells at the root of a tree a cemetery dweller one who lives in the open air one who doesn t lie down one who is content with whatever dwelling is assigned to him one who eats only one meal a day he notices i am one who eats only one meal a day but these other monks do not eat only one meal a day he exalts himself for being one who eats only one meal a day and disparages others this is the quality of a person of no integrity but a person of integrity notices it s not through being one who eats only one meal a day that the quality of greed goes to its end it s not through being one who eats only one meal a day that the quality of aversion the quality of delusion goes to its end even though one is not one who eats only one meal a day if practicing the dhamma in line with the dhamma practicing masterfully he is one who follows the dhamma he is to be honored for that praised for that so giving priority just to the practice he neither exalts himself for being one who eats only one meal a day nor disparages others this is the quality of a person of integrity furthermore a person of no integrity secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities enters remains in the first jh na rapture pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought evaluation he notices i have gained the attainment of the first jh na but these other monks have not gained the attainment of the first jh na he exalts himself for the attainment of the first jh na and disparages others this is the quality of a person of no integrity but a person of integrity notices the blessed one has spoken of non fashioning furthermore a person of no integrity enters remains in the second jh na the third jh na the fourth jh na the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor non perception he notices i have gained the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception but these other monks have not gained the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception he exalts himself for the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception and disparages others this is the quality of a person of no integrity a person of integrity notices the blessed one has spoken of non fashioning even with regard to the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception for by whatever means they construe it it becomes otherwise from that so giving priority to non fashioning he neither exalts himself for the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception nor disparages others this is the quality of a person of integrity a person of integrity completely transcending the dimension of neither perception nor non perception enters remains in the cessation of feeling perception when he sees with discernment his effluents are ended this is a monk who does not construe anything does not construe anywhere does not construe in any way that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near any desire passion delight or craving for form radha when one is caught up any desire passion delight or craving for feeling perception fabrications any desire passion delight or craving for consciousness radha when one is caught up there tied up there one is said to be a being in the same way radha you too should smash scatter demolish form and make it unfit for play practice for the ending of craving for form you should smash scatter demolish feeling and make it unfit for play practice for the ending of craving for feeling you should smash scatter demolish perception and make it unfit for play practice for the ending of craving for perception you should smash scatter demolish fabrications and make them unfit for play practice for the ending of craving for fabrications you should smash scatter demolish consciousness and make it unfit for play practice for the ending of craving for consciousness for the ending of craving radha is unbinding i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near when anathapindika the householder had left the city the light vanished and darkness appeared fear terror horripilation arose and because of that he wanted to turn back then a hundred elephants a hundred horses a hundred mule drawn carts a hundred thousand maidens adorned with jewels earrings aren t worth one sixteenth of one step forward go forward householder go forward householder going forward is better for you not back the darkness then vanished for anathapindika and the light appeared the fear terror horripilation he had felt subsided for a second time a third time the light vanished and darkness appeared fear terror horripilation arose and because of that anathapindika wanted to turn back then for a third time sivaka the yakkha spirit invisible proclaimed a hundred elephants a hundred horses a hundred mule drawn carts a hundred thousand maidens adorned with jewels earrings aren t worth one sixteenth of one step forward go forward householder go forward householder going forward is better for you not back the darkness then vanished for anathapindika and the light appeared the fear terror horripilation he had felt subsided so anathapindika went to the cool grove now at that time the blessed one having gotten up as the night was ending was pacing back forth in the open air he saw anathapindika the householder coming from afar on seeing him he got down from his meditation path and sat on a seat made ready as he was sitting there he said to anathapindika come sudatta then anathapindika thinking the blessed one is calling me by my given name threw himself down right there at the blessed one s feet and said to him lord i hope the blessed one has slept in ease there are these four grounds for the bonds of fellowship which four generosity kind words beneficial help consistency these are the four grounds for the bonds of fellowship generosity kind words beneficial help consistency in the face of events in line with what s appropriate in each case each case these bondsi have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near then not long after the blessed one had left a certain monk went to whenever the blessed one sets his own lodging in order and without calling his attendant or informing the community of monks sets out wandering alone without a companion he wants to live alone he is not to be followed by anyone at such times then after wandering by stages the blessed one came to then a large number of monks went to ven ananda and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings after an exchange of friendly courtesies greetings they sat to one side as they were sitting there they said to ven ananda it has been a long time since we heard a dhamma talk in the blessed one s presence we want to hear a dhamma talk in the blessed one s presence then ven ananda went with those monks to where the blessed one was staying in parileyyaka at the root of the auspicious sal tree and on arrival after bowing down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there the blessed one instructed urged roused encouraged them with a talk on dhamma now on that occasion this train of thought appeared in the awareness of one of the monks now i wonder knowing in what way seeing in what way does one without delay put an end to the effluents the blessed one perceiving with his awareness the train of thought in the monk s awareness said to the monks i have analyzed taught you the dhamma monks i have analyzed taught you the four frames of reference the four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for awakening the noble eightfold path and yet even though i have analyzed taught you the dhamma still there appears this train of thought in the awareness of one of the monks now i wonder knowing in what way seeing in what way does one without delay put an end to the effluents well then knowing in what way seeing in what way or he doesn t assume form to be the self but he assumes the self as possessing form form as in the self self as in form or feeling to be the self the self as possessing feeling feeling as in the self self as in feeling or perception to be the self the self as possessing perception perception as in the self self as in perception or fabrications to be the self the self as possessing fabrications fabrications as in the self self as in fabrications or consciousness to be the self the self as possessing consciousness consciousness as in the self self as in consciousness now that assumption is a fabrication what is the cause what is the origination what is the birth what is the coming into existence of that fabrication to an uninstructed run of the mill person touched by the feeling born of contact with ignorance craving arises that fabrication is born of that and that fabrication is inconstant fabricated dependently co arisen that craving that feeling that contact that ignorance is inconstant fabricated dependently co arisen it is by knowing seeing in this way that one without delay puts an end to the effluents or he doesn t assume form to be the self but he may have a view such as this this self is the same as the cosmos this i will be after death constant lasting eternal not subject to change this eternalist view is a fabrication or he may have a view such as this i would not be neither would there be what is mine i will not be neither will there be what is mine this annihilationist view is a fabrication or he may be doubtful uncertain having come to no conclusion with regard to the true dhamma that doubt uncertainty coming to no conclusion is a fabrication what is the cause what is the origination what is the birth what is the coming into existence of that fabrication to an uninstructed run of the mill person touched by what is felt born of contact with ignorance craving arises that fabrication is born of that and that fabrication is inconstant fabricated dependently co arisen that craving that feeling that contact that ignorance is inconstant fabricated dependently co arisen it is by knowing seeing in this way that one without delay puts an end to the effluents at as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said now what monks are the five aggregates whatever form is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the form aggregate whatever feeling is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the feeling aggregate whatever perception is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the perception aggregate whatever mental fabrications are past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near those are called the fabrications aggregate whatever consciousness is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the consciousness aggregate these are called the five aggregates and what are the five clinging aggregates whatever form past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with mental fermentation that is called the form clinging aggregate whatever feeling past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with mental fermentation that is called the feeling clinging aggregate whatever perception past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with mental fermentation that is called the perception clinging aggregate whatever mental fabrications past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near are clingable offer sustenance and are accompanied with mental fermentation those are called the fabrications clinging aggregate whatever consciousness past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with mental fermentation that is called the consciousness clinging aggregate these are called the five clinging aggregates monks it is in dependence on the in the same way it is in dependence on virtue established on virtue having developed pursued the there is the case where a monk develops on one occasion ven maha yes friend the monks responded to him ven maha cunda said friends there is the case where dhamma devotee monks then there is the case where jhana monks disparage dhamma devotee monks saying these people say we are dhamma devotees we are dhamma devotees but they are excitable boisterous unsteady mouthy loose in their talk muddled in their mindfulness unalert unconcentrated their minds wandering their senses uncontrolled why indeed are they dhamma devotees for what purpose are they dhamma devotees how are they dhamma devotees in that the jhana monks do not shine brightly and the dhamma devotee monks do not shine brightly that is not practicing for the welfare of the masses for the happiness of the masses for the good of the masses nor for the welfare happiness of human divine beings then there is the case where dhamma devotee monks praise only dhamma devotee monks and not jhana monks in that the dhamma devotee monks do not shine brightly and the jhana monks do not shine brightly that is not practicing for the welfare of the masses for the happiness of the masses for the good of the masses nor for the welfare happiness of human divine beings then there is the case where jhana monks praise only jhana monks and not dhamma devotee monks in that the jhana monks do not shine brightly and the dhamma devotee monks do not shine brightly that is not practicing for the welfare of the masses for the happiness of the masses for the good of the masses nor for the welfare happiness of human divine beings thus friends you should train yourselves being dhamma devotee monks we will speak in praise of jhana monks that s how you should train yourselves why is that because these are amazing people hard to find in the world i e those who dwell touching the deathless element with the body and thus friends you should train yourselves being jhana monks we will speak in praise of dhamma devotee monks that s how you should train yourselves why is that because these are amazing people hard to find in the world i e those who penetrate with discernment statements of deep meaning the buddha over and over the seeds all get planted over and over the rain god sprinkles rain over and over the farmer farms the field over and over the food grows in the realm over and over beggars do their begging over and over the givers give out gifts over and over the giver who has given over and over goes to a better place over and over he tires and he struggles over and over the fool goes to the womb over and over he s born and he dies over and over they bear him to his grave but one who s wisdom is wide as the earth is not born over and over for he s gained the path of not becoming over again days nights fly past life comes to an end the span of mortals runs out like the water of a piddling stream but the fool doing evil deeds doesn t realize that later it s bitter for him evil for him the result staying at savatthi monks gains offerings fame are a cruel thing a harsh bitter obstacle to the attainment of the unexcelled rest from bondage once monks a large family of turtles had lived for a long time in a certain freshwater lake then one turtle said to another my dear turtle don t go to that area but the turtle went to that area and because of that a hunter lanced him with a harpoon so he went back to the first turtle the first turtle saw him coming from afar and on seeing him said to him i hope dear turtle that you didn t go to that area i went to that area dear turtle then i hope you haven t been wounded or hurt i haven t been wounded or hurt but there s this cord that keeps dragging around behind me yes dear turtle you re wounded you re hurt it was because of that cord that your father grandfather fell into misfortune disaster now go dear turtle you are no longer one of us the hunter monks stands for so you should train yourselves we will put aside any gains offerings fame that have arisen and we will not let any gains offerings fame that have arisen keep our minds consumed that s how you should train yourselves whoever wants to do later what he should have done first falls away from the easeful state later burns with remorse one should speak as one would act not as one wouldn t when one speaks without acting the wise they can tell how very easeful unbinding as taught by the rightly self awakened one sorrowless dustless secure where stress suffering cease i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near anupiy in the mango grove and on that occasion ven bhaddiya k igodh s son on going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling would repeatedly exclaim what bliss what bliss a large number of monks heard ven bhaddiya k igodh s son on going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling repeatedly exclaim what bliss what bliss and on hearing him the thought occurred to them there s no doubt but that ven bhaddiya k igodh s son doesn t enjoy leading the holy life for when he was a householder he knew the bliss of kingship so that now on recollecting that when going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling he is repeatedly exclaiming what bliss what bliss so they went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they told him ven bhaddiya k igodh s son lord on going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling repeatedly exclaims what bliss what bliss there s no doubt but that ven bhaddiya doesn t enjoy leading the holy life for when he was a householder he knew the bliss of kingship so that now on recollecting that when going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling he is repeatedly exclaiming what bliss what bliss then the blessed one told a certain monk come monk in my name call bhaddiya saying the teacher calls you friend bhaddiya responding as you say lord to the blessed one the monk went to ven bhaddiya k igodh s son and on arrival he said to him the teacher calls you friend bhaddiya responding as you say my friend to the monk ven bhaddiya k igodh s son went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him is it true bhaddiya that on going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling you repeatedly exclaim what bliss what bliss yes lord what compelling reason do you have in mind that when going to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling you repeatedly exclaim what bliss what bliss before when i has a householder maintaining the bliss of kingship then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed from whose heart there is no provocation for whom becoming non becoming are overcome he beyond fear blissful with no grief is one the devas can t see see also at then i don t approve of birth my friend then mara the evil one sad dejected at realizing cala the nun knows me vanished right there mara sister cala one who overstepping and despising a sense of shame says i am your friend but does not take upon himself any tasks he is capable of doing is to be recognized as no friend one who speaks amiably to his companions but whose actions do not conform to it him the wise know for certain as a talker not a doer he is no friend who anticipating conflict is always alert in looking out for weaknesses one who bears the human burden of responsibility with its fruits and blessings in mind he cultivates a cause monks there are these five strengths for one in training which five strength of conviction strength of conscience strength of concern strength of persistence strength of discernment and what is strength of conviction there is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones has conviction is convinced of the tathagata s awakening indeed the blessed one is worthy and rightly self awakened consummate in knowledge conduct well gone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the teacher of divine human beings awakened blessed this monks is called the strength of conviction and what is the strength of conscience there is the case where a disciple of the noble ones feels shame at the thought of engaging in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct this is called the strength of conscience and what is the strength of concern there is the case where a disciple of the noble ones feels concern for the suffering that results from bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct this is called the strength of concern and what is the strength of persistence there is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities he is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities this is called the strength of persistence and what is the strength of discernment there is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones is discerning endowed with discernment of arising passing away noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress this is called the strength of discernment these monks are the five strengths of one in training thus you should train yourselves we will be endowed with the strength of conviction that is the strength of one in training with the strength of conscience the strength of concern the strength of persistence the strength of discernment that is the strength of one in training that s how you should train yourselves contents then the wanderer when this was said the blessed one was silent then is there no self a second time the blessed one was silent then vacchagotta the wanderer got up from his seat and left then not long after vacchagotta the wanderer had left ananda if i being asked by vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self were to answer that there is a self that would be conforming with those brahmans contemplatives who are exponents of eternalism the view that there is an eternal unchanging soul if i being asked by vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self were to answer that there is no self that would be conforming with those brahmans contemplatives who are exponents of annihilationism the view that death is the annihilation of consciousness if i being asked by vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self were to answer that there is a self would that be in keeping with the arising of knowledge that all phenomena are not self no lord and if i being asked by vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self were to answer that there is no self the bewildered vacchagotta would become even more bewildered does the self i used to have now not exist dwelling at when a wise person is obstructed by ignorance and conjoined with craving this body thus results now there is both this body and external name form here in dependence on this duality there is contact at the six senses touched by these or one or another of them the wise person is sensitive to pleasure pain so what difference what distinction what distinguishing factor is there between the wise person the fool for us lord the teachings have the blessed one as their root their guide their arbitrator it would be good if the blessed one himself would explicate the meaning of this statement having heard it from the blessed one the monks will remember it in that case monks listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said the ignorance with which the fool is obstructed the craving with which he is conjoined through which this body results that ignorance has not been abandoned by the fool that craving has not been destroyed why is that the fool has not practiced the holy life for the right ending of stress therefore at the break up of the body he is headed for a new body headed for a body he is not entirely freed from birth aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair i tell you he is not entirely freed from stress suffering the ignorance with which the wise person is obstructed the craving with which he is conjoined through which this body results that ignorance has been abandoned by the wise person that craving has been destroyed why is that the wise person has practiced the holy life for the right ending of stress therefore at the break up of the body he is not headed for a new body not headed for a body he is entirely freed from birth aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair he is i tell you entirely freed from stress suffering i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near r jagaha at the bamboo grove the squirrels sanctuary and on that occasion when ven upasena va gantaputta was alone in seclusion this line of thinking appeared to his awareness what a gain what a true gain it is for me that my teacher is the blessed one worthy and fully self awakened that i have gone forth from home to the homeless life in a well taught dhamma vinaya that my companions in the holy life are virtuous and endowed with admirable qualities that i have achieved culmination in terms of the precepts that my mind is unified and well concentrated that i am an arahant with effluents ended that i have great power great might fortunate has been my life fortunate will be my death then the blessed one comprehending with his awareness the line of thinking that had appeared to ven upasena va gantaputta s awareness on that occasion exclaimed he doesn t regret what life has been doesn t grieve at death if enlightened here bhikkhus a certain person abides with his heart imbued with loving kindness extending over the all encompassing world now whatever therein during that state of contemplation exists classifiable as form classifiable as a feeling of pleasure pain or neutrality classifiable as perception classifiable as determinative acts or classifiable as consciousness such ideas he sees as impermanent as liable to suffering as a disease as a cancer as a barb as a calamity as an affliction as alien as being worn away as void as not self on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears as a non returner in the retinue of the gods of the pure abodes where there are only those who have reached the noble path and where extinction of greed hate and delusion is reached in less than seven lives without return to this world and this kind of reappearance is not shared by ordinary men who have not reached the noble eightfold path i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at yes lord the monks replied to the blessed one the blessed one said monks a monk who is skilled in seven bases and has three modes of investigation is fulfilled fully accomplished in this doctrine discipline the ultimate person and how is a monk skilled in seven bases there is the case where a monk discerns form the origination of form the cessation of form the path of practice leading to the cessation of form he discerns the allure of form the drawback of form and the escape from form he discerns feeling he discerns perception he discerns fabrications he discerns consciousness the origination of consciousness the cessation of consciousness the path of practice leading to the cessation of consciousness he discerns the allure of consciousness the drawback of consciousness and the escape from consciousness for any brahmans or contemplatives who by directly knowing form in this way directly knowing the origination of form in this way directly knowing the cessation of form in this way directly knowing the path of practice leading to the cessation of form in this way

describing them and what is feeling these and what is perception these six classes of perception perception of form perception of sound perception of smell perception of taste perception of tactile sensation perception of ideas this is called perception from the origination of contact comes the origination of perception from the cessation of contact comes the cessation of perception and just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of perception the fact that pleasure happiness arises in dependence on perception that is the allure of perception the fact that perception is inconstant stressful subject to change that is the drawback of perception the subduing of desire passion for perception the abandoning of desire passion for perception that is the escape from perception and what are fabrications these six classes of intention intention with regard to form intention with regard to sound intention with regard to smell intention with regard to taste intention with regard to tactile sensation intention with regard to ideas these are called fabrications from the origination of contact comes the origination of fabrications from the cessation of contact comes the cessation of fabrications and just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of fabrications the fact that pleasure happiness arises in dependence on fabrications that is the allure of fabrications the fact that fabrications are inconstant stressful subject to change that is the drawback of fabrications the subduing of desire passion for

are from disenchantment dispassion cessation lack of clinging sustenance with regard to consciousness released they are well released those who are well released are fully accomplished and with those who are fully accomplished there is no cycle for the sake of describing them this is how a monk is skilled in seven bases a monk who is skilled in seven bases and has three modes of investigation is fulfilled and fully accomplished in this doctrine discipline the ultimate person i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near there is the case where a monk remains focused on unattractiveness with regard to the body is percipient of foulness with regard to food is percipient of distaste with regard to every world is percipient of the undesirability when these five things don t leave a monk who is weak sickly it can be expected of him that before long with the ending of the fermentations he will enter remain in the fermentation free awareness release discernment release having realized directly known them for himself in the here now then two brahman cosmologists went to the blessed one and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies they sat to one side as they were sitting there they said to the blessed one master gotama enough brahmans put this question aside i will teach you the dhamma listen and pay close attention i will speak yes sir the brahmans responded to the blessed one and the blessed one said these there is the case where a monk quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities enters remains in the first jh na rapture pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought evaluation this is called a monk who coming to the end of the cosmos remains at the end of the cosmos others say of him he is encompassed in the cosmos he has not escaped from the cosmos and i too say of him he is encompassed in the cosmos he has not escaped from the cosmos similarly with the second third fourth jh nas and with the attainment of the dimensions of the infinitude of space the infinitude of consciousness nothingness and neither perception nor non perception furthermore with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception he enters remains in the cessation of perception feeling and having seen that with discernment his fermentations are completely ended this is called a monk who coming to the end of the cosmos remains at the end of the cosmos having crossed over attachment in the cosmos thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living near savatthi at jetavana at anathapindika s monastery now when the night was far advanced a certain deity whose surpassing radiance illuminated the whole of jetavana came to the presence of the blessed one respectfully saluted him and stood beside him standing thus he addressed the blessed one in verse when monks a monk lives and practices like this it occasionally happens that through a lapse of mindfulness evil and unskilled states arise memories and thoughts thus monks if a monk s life and practice are so informed with wisdom that living thus he is not assailed by longing and depression which are evil states then monks if a king s ministers friends favorites kinsmen or blood relations should come and offer him wealth saying come good master why let these yellow robes torment you why go around with shaven head and bowl come on return to the lower life enjoy possessions and do works of merit monks for a monk so living and practicing to reject the training and revert to the lower life would just be impossible there are these ten fetters which ten five lower fetters five higher fetters and which are the five lower fetters self identity views uncertainty grasping at precepts practices sensual desire ill will these are the five lower fetters and which are the five higher fetters passion for form passion for what is formless conceit restlessness ignorance these are the five higher fetters and these are the ten fetters i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery now at that time a large number of monks after the meal on returning from their alms round were sitting gathered together at a pavilion when this discussion arose who friends knows a craft who s studying which craft which is the supreme among crafts with regard to that some said the elephant craft is the supreme craft among crafts some said the horse craft is the supreme craft among crafts the chariot craft archery swordsmanship signalingthen the blessed one emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the pavilion and on arrival sat down on a seat laid out as he was sitting there he addressed the monks for what topic are you sitting together here and what was the discussion that came to no conclusion just now lord after the meal on returning from our alms round we were sitting gathered together here at the pavilion when this discussion arose they repeat what had been said it isn t proper monks that sons of good families on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life should talk on such a topic when you have gathered you have two duties either dhamma talk or noble silence then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed supporting himself without a craft light desiring the goal his faculties controlled released everywhere living in no home unpossessive free from longing having slain m ra going alone a monk see also sn on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the so he went to the blessed one and on arrival recited this verse what jobs are getting done monk in the sala forest alone in the wilderness in what does gotama find delight when this was said the brahman navakammika bharadvaja said to the blessed one the buddha iat and how is physical food to be regarded no lord wouldn t they eat that food simply for the sake of making it through that desert yes lord in the same way i tell you is the nutriment of physical food to be regarded when physical food is comprehended passion for the five strings of sensuality is comprehended when passion for the five strings of sensuality is comprehended there is no fetter bound by which a disciple of the noble ones would come back again to this world and how is the nutriment of contact to be regarded and how is the nutriment of intellectual intention to be regarded and how is the nutriment of consciousness to be regarded even if he were to be shot with only one spear lord he would experience pain distress from that cause to say nothing of three hundred spears in the same way i tell you monks is the nutriment of consciousness to be regarded when the nutriment of consciousness is comprehended name form are comprehended when name form are comprehended i tell you there is nothing further for a disciple of the noble ones to do on one occasion in a confining place he found an opening the one of extensive wisdom the awakened one who awakened to jhana now which my friend is the confining place and which opening in the confining place is the blessed one said to have attained ven ananda the five strings of sensuality my friend are described by the blessed one as a confining place which five forms cognizable via the eye agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing sounds cognizable via the ear smells cognizable via the nose tastes cognizable via the tongue tactile sensations cognizable via the body agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing these five strings of sensuality are described by the blessed one as a confining place now there is the case where a monk quite secluded from sensuality then there is the case where a monk with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance even this much is described by the blessed one as the attaining of an opening in a confining place though followed by a sequel for even there there s a confining place what is the confining place there just that then there is the case where a monk with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding even this much is described by the blessed one as the attaining of an opening in a confining place though followed by a sequel for even there there s a confining place what is the confining place there just that then there is the case where a monk with the abandoning of pleasure stress as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain even this much is described by the blessed one as the attaining of an opening in a confining place though followed by a sequel for even there there s a confining place what is the confining place there just that then there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving infinite space enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space even this much is described by the blessed one as the attaining of an opening in a confining place though followed by a sequel for even there there s a confining place what is the confining place there just that then there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space perceiving infinite consciousness enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness even this much is described by the blessed one as the attaining of an opening in a confining place though followed by a sequel for even there there s a confining place what is the confining place there just that then there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness perceiving there is nothing enters remains in the dimension of nothingness even this much is described by the blessed one as the attaining of an opening in a confining place though followed by a sequel for even there there s a confining place what is the confining place there just that then there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness enters remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non perception even this much is described by the blessed one as the attaining of an opening in a confining place though followed by a sequel for even there there s a confining place what is the confining place there just that then there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception enters remains in the cessation of perception feeling and having seen that with discernment his mental fermentations are completely ended even this much is described by the blessed one as the attaining of an opening in a confining place without a sequel then kesi the horsetrainer went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him you kesi are a trained man a trainer of tamable horses and how do you train a tamable horse lord i train a tamable horse sometimes with gentleness sometimes with harshness sometimes with both gentleness harshness and if a tamable horse doesn t submit either to a mild training or to a harsh training or to a mild harsh training kesi what do you do if a tamable horse doesn t submit either to a mild training or to a harsh training or to a mild and harsh training lord then i kill it why is that i think don t let this be a disgrace to my lineage of teachers but the blessed one lord is the unexcelled trainer of tamable people how do you train a tamable person kesi i train a tamable person sometimes with gentleness sometimes with harshness sometimes with both gentleness harshness in using gentleness i teach such is good bodily conduct such is the result of good bodily conduct such is good verbal conduct such is the result of good verbal conduct such is good mental conduct such is the result of good mental conduct such are the devas such are human beings in using harshness i teach such is bodily misconduct such is the result of bodily misconduct such is verbal misconduct such is the result of verbal misconduct such is mental misconduct such is the result of mental misconduct such is hell such is the animal womb such the realm of the hungry shades in using gentleness harshness i teach such is good bodily conduct such is the result of good bodily conduct such is bodily misconduct such is the result of bodily misconduct such is good verbal conduct such is

mild training or to a harsh training or to a mild harsh training what do you do if a tamable person doesn t submit either to a mild training or to a harsh training or to a mild harsh training then i kill him kesi but it s not proper for our blessed one to take life and yet the blessed one just said i kill him kesi yes lord wouldn t one be totally destroyed if the tathagata doesn t regard one as being worth speaking to or admonishing and one s knowledgeable fellows in the holy life don t regard one as being worth speaking to or admonishing at why is that from an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration a beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating wandering on long have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things enough to become dispassionate enough to be released in the case of pleasant feelings o monks the underlying tendency if a monk has given up the tendency to lust in regard to pleasant feeling the tendency to resistance in regard to painful feelings and the tendency to ignorance in regard to neither painful nor pleasant feelings then he is called one who is free of unwholesome tendencies one who has the right outlook he has cut off craving severed the fetters to future existence and through the full penetration of conceit if one feels joy but knows not feeling s nature bent towards greed he will not find deliverance if one feels pain but knows not feeling s nature bent toward hate he will not find deliverance and even neutral feeling which as peaceful the lord of wisdom has proclaimed if in attachment he should cling to it he will not be free from the round of ill and having done so in this very life will be free from cankers free from taints mature in knowledge firm in dhamma s ways when once his life span ends his body breaks all measure and concept he has transcended i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in then the blessed one emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the meeting hall and on arrival sat down on a seat made ready as he was sitting there he addressed the monks for what topic of conversation are you gathered together here in the midst of what topic of conversation have you been interrupted just now lord after the meal on returning from our alms round we gathered at the meeting hall and got engaged in many kinds of bestial topics of conversation conversation about kings robbers ministers of state armies alarms battles food drink clothing furniture garlands scents relatives vehicles villages towns cities the countryside women heroes the gossip of the street the well tales of the dead tales of diversity the creation of the world of the sea talk of whether things exist or not it isn t right monks that sons of good families on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life should get engaged in such topics of conversation i e conversation about kings robbers ministers of state talk of whether things exist or not on one occasion ven uttara was staying in friends it s good for a monk periodically to have reflected on his own failings it s good for a monk periodically to have reflected on the failings of others it s good for a monk periodically to have reflected on his own attainments it s good for a monk periodically to have reflected on the attainments of others now on that occasion the so sakka the deva king just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm disappeared from the devas of the heaven of the thirty three and reappeared in mahisavatthu on sankheyyaka mountain in dhavajalika in ven uttara s presence then he went to ven uttara and on arrival bowed down to him and stood to one side as he was standing there he said to ven uttara is it true venerable sir that ven uttara is teaching the monks the dhamma in this way friends it s good for a monk periodically to have reflected on his own failings on the failings of others on his own attainments on the attainments of others yes deva king but is this ven uttara s own extemporaneous invention or is it the saying of the blessed one the worthy one the rightly self awakened one very well then deva king i will give you an analogy for there are cases where it s through an analogy that observant people can understand the meaning of what is being said suppose that not far from a village or town there was a great pile of grain from which a great crowd of people were carrying away grain on their bodies on their heads in their laps or in their cupped hands if someone were to approach that great crowd of people and ask them from where are you carrying away grain answering in what way would that great crowd of people answer so as to be answering rightly venerable sir they would answer we are carrying it from that great pile of grain so as to be answering rightly in the same way deva king whatever is well said is all a saying of the blessed one the worthy one the rightly self awakened one adopting it again again from there do we others speak amazing venerable sir astounding venerable sir how well that has been said by ven uttara whatever is well said is all a saying of the blessed one the worthy one the rightly self awakened one adopting it again again from there do we others speak conquered by eight untrue dhammas his mind overcome devadatta is headed for a state of deprivation headed for hell there to stay for an eon incurable which eight conquered by material gain his mind overcome devadatta is headed for a state of deprivation headed for hell there to stay for an eon incurable conquered by lack of material gain conquered by status conquered by lack of status conquered by offerings conquered by lack of offerings conquered by evil ambition conquered by evil friendship his mind overcome devadatta is headed for a state of deprivation headed for hell there to stay for an eon incurable monks it s good for a monk to keep conquering again again any arisen material gain it s good for a monk to keep conquering again again any arisen lack of material gain any arisen status any arisen lack of status any arisen offerings any arisen lack of offerings any arisen evil ambition any arisen evil friendship and for what compelling reason should a monk keep conquering again again any arisen material gain any arisen evil friendship because when one dwells not having conquered any arisen material gain effluents arise along with vexations fevers but when one dwells having conquered any arisen material gain those effluents vexations fevers are not similarly with any arisen lack of material gain any arisen status any arisen lack of status any arisen offerings any arisen lack of offerings any arisen evil ambition any arisen evil friendship it s for this compelling reason that a monk should keep conquering again again any arisen material gain any arisen evil friendship therefore monks you should train yourselves we will keep conquering again again any arisen material gain any arisen lack of material gain any arisen status any arisen lack of status any arisen offerings any arisen lack of offerings any arisen evil ambition any arisen evil friendship that s how you should train yourselves up to now ven uttara the four companies monks nuns lay men lay women have not established this dhamma discourse among human beings take up this dhamma discourse ven uttara master this dhamma discourse ven uttara remember this dhamma discourse ven uttara connected with the goal is this dhamma discourse and basic to the holy life i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near enough brahman put this question aside i will teach you the dhamma listen and pay close attention i will speak yes sir pi galakoccha the brahman responded to the blessed one the blessed one said brahman it s as if a man in need of heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood passing over the heartwood of a great standing tree possessed of heartwood passing over the sapwood passing over the inner bark passing over the outer bark cutting away the twigs leaves were to go off carrying them thinking heartwood a man with good eyesight seeing him would say ah how this good man didn t know heartwood

of a great standing tree possessed of heartwood were to go off carrying it knowing heartwood a man with good eyesight seeing him would say ah how this good man in the same way brahman there is the case where a certain son of good family just like the man who in need of heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood passing over the heartwood of a great standing tree possessed of heartwood passing over the sapwood passing over the inner bark passing over the outer bark cutting away the twigs leaves went off carrying them thinking heartwood whatever heartwood business he had

and which brahman are the qualities that are higher more sublime than knowledge vision there is the case where a monk quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities enters remains in the first jh na rapture pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought evaluation this is a quality higher more sublime than knowledge vision furthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters remains in the second jh na rapture pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance this too is a quality higher more sublime than knowledge vision furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jh na of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding this too is a quality higher more sublime than knowledge vision furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure stress as with the earlier disappearance of joys distresses he enters remains in the fourth jh na purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain this too is a quality higher more sublime than knowledge vision furthermore with the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving infinite space he enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space this too is a quality higher more sublime than knowledge vision furthermore with the complete transcending of the dimension of the

with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness perceiving there is nothing he enters remains in the dimension of nothingness this too is a quality higher more

feeling and having seen that with discernment his fermentations are completely ended this too is a quality higher more sublime than knowledge vision these are the qualities higher more sublime than knowledge vision just like the man who in need of heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood cutting away just the heartwood of a great standing tree possessed of heartwood went off carrying it knowing heartwood whatever heartwood business he had with heartwood his purpose will be served this individual i tell you is similar to that brahman this holy life doesn t have as its reward gain offerings fame doesn t have as its reward consummation of virtue doesn t have as its reward consummation of concentration doesn t have as its reward knowledge vision but the unprovoked he from whom a person learns the dhamma should be venerated as the devas venerate inda their lord but by following an inferior and foolish teacher who has not gained fine understanding of the dhamma and is envious of others one will approach death without comprehending the dhamma and unrelieved of doubt if a man going down into a river swollen and swiftly flowing is carried away by the current how can he help others across even so he who has not comprehended the dhamma has not paid attention to the meaning as expounded by the learned being himself without knowledge and unrelieved of doubt how can he make others understand but if the man at the river knows the method and is skilled and wise by boarding a strong boat equipped with oars and a rudder he can with its help set others across even so he who is experienced and has a well trained mind who is learned and dependable surely therefore one should associate with a good man who is wise and learned by understanding the meaning of what one has learned and practicing accordingly one who has dhamma experience i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near then devatas from the as she was standing there one of the devatas exclaimed in the blessed one s presence what a naga is gotama the contemplative and like a naga when bodily feelings have arisen painful fierce sharp wracking repellent disagreeable he endures them mindful alert unperturbed then another devata exclaimed in the blessed one s presence what a lion is gotama the contemplative and like a lion when bodily feelings have arisen painful fierce sharp wracking repellent disagreeable he endures them mindful alert unperturbed then another devata exclaimed in the blessed one s presence what a thoroughbred is gotama the contemplative and like a thoroughbred when bodily feelings have arisen painful fierce sharp wracking repellent disagreeable he endures them mindful alert unperturbed then another devata exclaimed in the blessed one s presence then another devata exclaimed in the blessed one s presence what a strong burden carrier is gotama the contemplative and like a strong burden carrier when bodily feelings have arisen painful fierce sharp wracking repellent disagreeable he endures them mindful alert unperturbed then another devata exclaimed in the blessed one s presence what a tamed one is gotama the contemplative and like a tamed one when bodily feelings have arisen painful fierce sharp wracking repellent disagreeable he endures them mindful alert unperturbed then another devata exclaimed in the blessed one s presence see a concentration well developed a mind well released neither pressed down nor forced back nor with mental fabrication kept blocked or suppressed whoever would think that such a naga of a man lion of a man thoroughbred of a man peerless bull of a man strong burden carrier of a man such a tamed man should be violated what else is that if not blindness five veda brahmans living austerely for years their minds are not rightly released lowly by nature they ve not gone beyond overpowered by craving bound up in precepts practices performing wretched austerities for years their minds are not rightly released lowly by nature they ve not gone beyond for one fond of conceit there s no taming for one uncentered no sagacity though alone in the wilderness if one lives heedlessly one won t cross over beyond mara s sway but having abandoned conceit well centered within with right awareness everywhere fully released alone in the wilderness heedfully living one will cross over beyond mara s sway i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near as they were sitting there the blessed one said to them monks whom in our native land do the native land monks his companions in the holy life esteem in this way having few wants himself he gives talks to the monks on fewness of wants contented himself he gives talks to the monks on contentment secluded himself he gives talks to the monks on seclusion unentangled himself he gives talks to the monks on non entanglement having aroused persistence in himself he gives talks to the monks on arousing persistence consummate in his own virtue he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in virtue consummate in his own concentration he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in concentration consummate in his own discernment he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in discernment consummate in his own release he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in release consummate in his own knowledge vision of release he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in the knowledge vision of release lord the monk named now at that time then the blessed one having stayed at rajagaha as long as he liked set out wandering to then a certain monk went to ven sariputta and on arrival said to him friend sariputta the monk named punna mantaniputta whom you have so often praised instructed urged roused encouraged with the blessed one s dhamma talk delighting approving of the blessed one s words has gotten up from his seat bowed down to the blessed one circumambulated him and has gone to the grove of the blind for the day s abiding so ven sariputta quickly picked up a sitting cloth and followed right behind ven punna keeping his head in sight ven punna plunged into the grove of the blind and sat down in the shade of a tree for the day s abiding ven sariputta also plunged into the grove of the blind and sat down in the shade of a tree for the day s abiding then in the evening ven sariputta arose from his seclusion and went to ven punna on arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to ven punna my friend is the holy life lived under the blessed one yes my friend and is the holy life lived under the blessed one for the sake of purity in terms of virtue no my friend then is the holy life lived under the blessed one for the sake of purity in terms of mind concentration no my friend then is the holy life lived under the blessed one for the sake of purity in terms of view no my friend then is the holy life lived under the blessed one for the sake of purity in terms of the overcoming of perplexity no my friend then is the holy life lived under the blessed one for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge vision of what is is not the path no my friend then is the holy life lived under the blessed one for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge vision of the way no my friend then is the holy life lived under the blessed one for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge vision no my friend when asked if the holy life is lived under the blessed one for the sake of purity in terms of virtue you say no my friend when asked if the holy life is lived under the blessed one for the sake of purity in terms of mind view the overcoming of perplexity knowledge vision of what is is not the path knowledge vision of the way knowledge vision you say no my friend for the sake of what then my friend is the holy life lived under the blessed one the holy life is lived under the blessed one my friend for the sake of total unbinding through lack of clinging but is purity in terms of virtue total unbinding through lack of clinging no my friend then is purity in terms of mind view the overcoming of perplexity knowledge vision of what is is not the path knowledge vision of the way knowledge vision total unbinding through lack of clinging no my friend then is total unbinding through lack of clinging something apart from these qualities no my friend when asked if purity in terms of virtue mind view the overcoming of perplexity knowledge vision of what is is not the path knowledge vision of the way knowledge vision is total unbinding through lack of clinging you say no my friend but when asked if total unbinding through lack of clinging is something apart from these qualities you say no my friend now how my friend is the meaning of these statements to be understood if the blessed one had described purity in terms of virtue as total unbinding through lack of clinging my friend then he would have defined something still accompanied by clinging as total unbinding through lack of clinging if he had described purity in terms of mind view the overcoming of perplexity knowledge vision of what is is not the path knowledge vision of the way knowledge vision as total unbinding through lack of clinging then he would have defined something still accompanied by clinging as total unbinding through lack of clinging but if total unbinding through lack of clinging were apart from these qualities then a run of the mill person would be totally unbound inasmuch as a run of the mill person is apart from these qualities so my friend i will give you an analogy for there are cases where it s through analogies that knowledgeable people can understand the meaning of what is being said answering in this way my friend he would answer them correctly just now as i was staying at savatthi some urgent business arose at saketa and between savatthi and saketa seven relay chariots were made ready for me coming out the door of the inner palace in savatthi i got in the first relay chariot by means of the first relay chariot i reached the second relay chariot getting out of the first relay chariot i got in the second relay chariot by means of the second relay chariot i reached the third by means of the third i reached the fourth by means of the fourth the fifth by means of the fifth the sixth by means of the sixth i reached the seventh relay chariot getting out of the sixth relay chariot i got in the seventh relay chariot by means of the seventh relay chariot i finally arrived at the door of the inner palace at saketa answering in this way he would answer them correctly in the same way my friend purity in terms of virtue is simply for the sake of purity in terms of mind purity in terms of mind is simply for the sake of purity in terms of view purity in terms of view is simply for the sake of purity in terms of the overcoming of perplexity purity in terms of the overcoming of perplexity is simply for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge vision of what is is not the path purity in terms of knowledge vision of what is is not the path is simply for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge vision of the way purity in terms of knowledge vision of the way is simply for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge vision purity in terms of knowledge vision is simply for the sake of total unbinding through lack of clinging and it s for the sake of total unbinding through lack of clinging that the holy life is lived under the blessed one when this was said ven sariputta said to ven punna mantaniputta what is your name friend and how do your companions in the holy life know you my name is punna friend and my companions in the holy life know me as mantaniputta how amazing my friend how astounding that ven punna mantaniputta has answered point by point with profound profound discernment in the manner of a learned disciple who has rightly understood the teacher s message it s a gain a great gain for any of his companions in the holy life who get to see him and visit with him even if they had to carry him around on a cushion placed on top of their heads in order to see him and visit with him it would be a gain for them a great gain and the fact that i have gotten to see him and visit with him has been a gain a great gain for me when this was said ven punna said to ven sariputta and what is your name friend and how do your companions in the holy life know you my name is what i ve been talking with the disciple who is like the teacher himself without knowing that it is ven sariputta had i known it was ven sariputta i wouldn t have answered at such length how amazing my friend how astounding that ven sariputta has questioned point by point with profound profound discernment in the manner of a learned disciple who has rightly understood the teacher s message it s a gain a great gain for any of his companions in the holy life who get to see him and visit with him even if they had to carry him around on a cushion placed on top of their heads in order to see him and visit with him it would be a gain for them a great gain and the fact that i have gotten to see him and visit with him has been a gain a great gain for me in this way did both great beings rejoice in each other s good words at savatthi for a monk practicing the dhamma in accordance with the dhamma what accords with the dhamma is this that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to form that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to feeling that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to perception that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to fabrications that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to consciousness as he keeps cultivating disenchantment with regard to form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he comprehends form feeling perception

tree or to the open air wherever he goes wherever he stands wherever he sits wherever he lies down he is sunk in misery in the same way there is the case where a certain monk is conquered by gains offerings fame his mind consumed he finds no pleasure whether he goes to an empty dwelling to the foot of a tree or to the open air wherever he goes wherever he stands wherever he sits wherever he lies down he is sunk in misery that s how cruel gains offerings fame are a harsh bitter obstacle to the attainment of the unexcelled rest from bondage thus you should train yourselves we will put

of reference their development and the path of practice leading to their development listen pay close attention i will speak now this is called the frames of reference and what is the development of the frames of reference there is the case where a monk remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body remains focused on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body remains focused on the phenomenon of origination passing away with regard to the body ardent alert mindful putting aside greed distress with reference to the world he remains focused on the

yes friend ananda he could but how friend sariputta could a monk have an attainment of concentration such he would neither be percipient of earth with regard to earth nor of the next world with regard to the next world and yet he would still be percipient once friend ananda when i was staying right here in savatthi in the blind man s grove i reached concentration in such a way that i was neither percipient of earth with regard to earth nor of the next world with regard to the next world and yet i was still percipient but what friend sariputta were you percipient of at that time the cessation of becoming unbinding the cessation of becoming unbinding one perception arose in me friend ananda as another perception ceased just as in a blazing woodchip fire one flame arises as another flame ceases even so the cessation of becoming unbinding the cessation of becoming unbinding one perception arose in me as another one ceased i was percipient at that time of the cessation of becoming unbinding i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at now on that occasion the uposatha day of the fifteenth the full moon night of the pavarana ceremony the blessed one was seated in the open air surrounded by the community of monks surveying the silent community of monks he addressed them monks i am content with this practice i am content at heart with this practice so arouse even more intense persistence for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized i will remain right here at savatthi for another month through the white water lily month the fourth month of the rains the monks in the countryside heard the blessed one they say will remain right there at savatthi through the white water lily month the fourth month of the rains so they left for savatthi to see the blessed one then the elder monks taught instructed the new monks even more intensely some elder monks were teaching instructing ten monks some were teaching instructing twenty monks some were teaching instructing thirty monks some were teaching instructing forty monks the new monks being taught instructed by the elder monks were discerning grand successive distinctions now on that occasion the uposatha day of the fifteenth the full moon night of the white water lily month the fourth month of the rains the blessed one was seated in the open air surrounded by the community of monks surveying the silent community of monks he addressed them in this community of monks there are monks who are arahants whose mental effluents are ended who have reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal laid to waste the fetter of becoming and who are released through right gnosis such are the monks in this community of monks in this community of monks there are monks who with the wasting away of the five lower fetters are due to be reborn in the pure abodes there to be totally unbound destined never again to return from that world such are the monks in this community of monks in this community of monks there are monks who with the wasting away of the first three fetters and with the attenuation of passion aversion delusion are once returners who on returning only once more to this world will make an ending to stress such are the monks in this community of monks in this community of monks there are monks who with the wasting away of the first three fetters are stream winners steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for self awakening such are the monks in this community of monks in this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to the development of the four frames of reference the four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for awakening the noble eightfold path such are the monks in this community of monks in this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to the development of good will compassion appreciation equanimity the perception of the foulness of the body the perception of inconstancy such are the monks in this community of monks in this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to mindfulness of in out breathing mindfulness of in out breathing when developed pursued is of great fruit of great benefit mindfulness of in out breathing when developed pursued brings the four frames of reference to their culmination the four frames of reference when developed pursued bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination the seven factors for awakening when developed pursued bring clear knowing release to their culmination mindfulness of in out breathing now how is mindfulness of in out breathing developed pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefit this is how mindfulness of in out breathing is developed pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefit the four frames of reference and how is mindfulness of in out breathing developed pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination this is how mindfulness of in out breathing is developed pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination the seven factors for awakening and how are the four frames of reference developed pursued so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination this is how the four frames of reference are developed pursued so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination clear knowing release and how are the seven factors for awakening developed pursued so as to bring clear knowing release to their culmination there is the case where a monk develops this is how the seven factors for awakening are developed pursued so as to bring clear knowing release to their culmination that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words then a certain monk went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one one who dwells in the dhamma one who dwells in the dhamma thus it is said lord to what extent is a bhikkhu one who dwells in the dhamma monk there is the case where a monk studies the dhamma dialogues narratives of mixed prose and verse explanations verses spontaneous exclamations quotations birth stories amazing events question answer sessions then there is the case where a monk takes the dhamma as he has heard studied it and teaches it in full detail to others he spends the day in dhamma description he neglects seclusion he doesn t commit himself to internal tranquillity of awareness this is called a monk who is keen on description not one who dwells in the dhamma then there is the case where a monk takes the dhamma as he has heard studied it and recites it in full detail he spends the day in dhamma recitation he neglects seclusion he doesn t commit himself to internal tranquillity of awareness this is called a monk who is keen on recitation not one who dwells in the dhamma then there is the case where a monk takes the dhamma as he has heard studied it and thinks about it evaluates it and examines it with his intellect he spends the day in dhamma thinking he neglects seclusion he doesn t commit himself to internal tranquillity of awareness this is called a monk who is keen on thinking not one who dwells in the dhamma then there is the case where a monk studies the dhamma dialogues narratives of mixed prose and verse explanations verses spontaneous exclamations quotations birth stories amazing events question answer sessions he doesn t spend the day in dhamma study he doesn t neglect seclusion he commits himself to internal tranquillity of awareness this is called a monk who dwells in the dhamma now monk i have taught you the person who is keen on study the one who is keen on description the one who is keen on recitation the one who is keen on thinking and the one who dwells in the dhamma whatever a teacher should do seeking the welfare of his disciples out of sympathy for them that have i done for you over there are the roots of trees over there empty dwellings practice jhana monk don t be heedless don t later fall into regret this is our message to you a deva the buddha i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near the blessed one friend is strong free from illness i trust that the community of monks is strong free from illness the community of monks is also strong free from illness at the tandulapala gate is a brahman named dhana janin dhana janin the brahman is also strong free from illness and i trust that dhana janin the brahman is heedful from where would our dhana janin the brahman get any heedfulness friend relying on the king he plunders brahmans householders relying on the brahmans householders he plunders the king his wife a woman of faith fetched from a family with faith has died he has fetched another wife a woman of no faith from a family with no faith what a bad thing to hear my friend when we hear that dhana janin the brahman is heedless perhaps sooner or later we might meet with dhana janin the brahman perhaps there might be some conversation then ven sariputta having stayed in the southern mountains as long as he liked wandered in the direction of rajagaha after wandering by stages he arrived at rajagaha there he stayed near rajagaha in the squirrels sanctuary then early in the morning ven sariputta put on his robes and carrying his bowl outer robe went into rajagaha for alms and on that occasion dhana janin the brahman was milking cows in a cow pen outside the city then ven sariputta having gone for alms in rajagaha after his meal on his way back from his almsround went to dhana janin the brahman dhana janin the brahman saw ven sariputta coming from afar on seeing him he went to him and said drink some of this fresh milk master sariputta it must be time for your meal that s all right brahman i have finished my meal for today my day s abiding will be under that tree over there you may come there as you say master dhana janin responded to ven sariputta then after he had finished his morning meal he went to ven sariputta on arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with ven sariputta and after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies sat to one side as he was sitting there ven sariputta said to him i trust dhana janin that you are heedful from where would we get any heedfulness master when parents are to be supported wife children are to be supported slaves workers are to be supported friend companion duties are to be done for friends companions kinsmen relative duties for kinsmen relatives guest duties for guests departed ancestor duties for departed ancestors devata duties for devatas king duties for the king and this body also has to be refreshed nourished what do you think dhana janin there is the case where a certain person for the sake of his mother father does what is unrighteous does what is discordant then because of his unrighteous discordant behavior hell wardens drag him off to hell would he gain anything by saying i did what is unrighteous what is discordant for the sake of my mother father don t throw me into hell hell wardens or would his mother father gain anything for him by saying he did what is unrighteous what is discordant for our sake don t throw him into hell hell wardens no master sariputta even right while he was wailing they d cast him into hell what do you think dhana janin there is the case where a certain person for the sake of his wife children his slaves workers his friends companions his kinsmen relatives his guests his departed ancestors the devatas the king does what is unrighteous does what is discordant then because of his unrighteous discordant behavior hell wardens drag him off to hell would he gain anything by saying i did what is unrighteous what is discordant for the sake of the king don t throw me into hell hell wardens or would the king gain anything for him by saying he did what is unrighteous what is discordant for our sake don t throw him into hell hell wardens no master sariputta even right while he was wailing they d cast him into hell what do you think dhana janin there is the case where a certain person for the sake of refreshing nourishing his body does what is unrighteous does what is discordant then because of his unrighteous discordant behavior hell wardens drag him off to hell would he gain anything by saying i did what is unrighteous what is discordant for the sake of refreshing nourishing my body don t throw me into hell hell wardens or would others gain anything for him by saying he did what is unrighteous what is discordant for the sake of refreshing nourishing his body don t throw him into hell hell wardens no master sariputta even right while he was wailing they d cast him into hell now what do you think dhana janin which is the better one who for the sake of his mother father would do what is unrighteous what is discordant or one who for the sake of his mother father would do what is righteous what is concordant master sariputta the one who for the sake of his mother father would do what is unrighteous what is discordant is not the better one the one who for the sake of his mother father would do what is righteous what is concordant would be the better one there righteous behavior concordant behavior is better than unrighteous behavior discordant behavior dhana janin there are other activities reasonable righteous by which one can support one s mother father and at the same time both not do evil and practice the practice of merit what do you think dhana janin which is the better one who for the sake of his wife children his slaves workers his friends companions his kinsmen relatives his guests his departed ancestors the devatas the king refreshing nourishing his body would do what is unrighteous what is discordant or one who for the sake of refreshing nourishing his body would do what is righteous what is concordant master sariputta the one who for the sake of refreshing nourishing his body would do what is unrighteous what is discordant is not the better one the one who for the sake of refreshing nourishing his body would do what is righteous what is concordant would be the better one there righteous behavior concordant behavior is better than unrighteous behavior discordant behavior dhana janin there are other activities reasonable righteous by which one can refresh nourish one s body and at the same time both not do evil and practice the practice of merit then dhana janin the brahman delighting rejoicing in ven sariputta s words got up from his seat and left then on a later occasion dhana janin the brahman became diseased in pain severely ill so he said to one of his men come my good man go to the blessed one and on arrival pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say lord dhana janin the brahman is diseased in pain severely ill he pays homage with his head to the blessed one s feet then go to ven sariputta and on arrival pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say venerable sir dhana janin the brahman is diseased in pain severely ill he pays homage with his head to ven sariputta s feet then say it would be good if ven sariputta would visit dhana janin s home out of sympathy for him responding as you say lord to dhana janin the brahman the man went to the blessed one and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one side as he was sitting there he said lord dhana janin the brahman is diseased in pain severely ill he pays homage with his head to the blessed one s feet then he went to ven sariputta and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one side as he was sitting there he said venerable sir dhana janin the brahman is diseased in pain severely ill he pays homage with his head to ven sariputta s feet then he said it would be good if ven sariputta would visit dhana janin s home out of sympathy for him ven sariputta acquiesced through silence then ven sariputta having put on his robes and taking his bowl outer robe went to dhana janin s home on arrival he sat down on a prepared seat and said to him i trust you are getting better dhana janin i trust you are comfortable i trust that your pains are lessening and not increasing i trust that there are signs of their lessening and not of their increasing i am not getting better master sariputta i am not comfortable my severe pains are increasing not lessening there are signs of their increasing and not of their lessening extreme forces slice through my head just as if a strong man were slicing my head open with a sharp sword extreme pains have arisen in my head just as if a strong man were tightening a turban on my head with a tough leather strap extreme forces carve up my stomach cavity just as if an expert butcher or his apprentice were to carve up the stomach cavity of an ox with a sharp butcher s knife there is an extreme burning in my body just as if two strong men seizing a weaker man with their arms were to roast and broil him over a pit of hot embers i am not getting better venerable sir i am not comfortable my severe pains are increasing not lessening there are signs of their increasing and not of their lessening what do you think dhana janin which is better hell or the animal womb the animal womb is better than hell master sariputta which is better the animal womb or the realm of the hungry shades the realm of the hungry shades the realm of the hungry shades or human beings human beings human beings or the four great king devas the four great king devas the four great king devas or the devas of the thirty three the devas of the thirty three the devas of the thirty three or the yama devas the yama devas the yama devas or the tusita devas the tusita devas the tusita devas or the nimmanarati devas the nimmanarati devas the nimmanarati devas or the paranimmitavasavatti devas the paranimmitavasavatti devas the paranimmitavasavatti devas or the brahma world did master sariputta say brahma world did master sariputta say brahma world then the thought occurred to ven sariputta these brahmans are set on the brahma world what if i were to teach dhana janin the brahman the path to union with the brahmas so he said dhana janin i will teach you the path to union with the brahmas listen and pay careful attention to that i will speak as you say master dhana janin the brahman responded to ven sariputta ven sariputta said and what is the path to union with the brahmas there is the case where a monk keeps pervading the first direction the east with an awareness imbued with good will likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth thus above below all around everywhere in its entirety he keeps pervading the all encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with good will abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without ill will he keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with compassion appreciation equanimity likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth thus above below all around everywhere in its entirety he keeps pervading the all encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with equanimity abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without ill will this dhana janin is the path to union with the brahmas in that case master sariputta pay homage to the blessed one s feet with your head in my name and say lord dhana janin the brahman is diseased in pain severely ill he pays homage with his head to the blessed one s feet so ven sariputta when there was still more to be done having established dhana janin the brahman in the inferiorand the blessed one said to the monks monks sariputta when there was still more to be done having established dhana janin the brahman in the inferior brahma world has gotten up from his seat and left then ven sariputta went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one lord dhana janin the brahman is diseased in pain severely ill he pays homage with his head to the blessed one s feet but why sariputta when there was still more to be done having established dhana janin the brahman in the inferior brahma world did you get up from your seat and leave the thought occurred to me lord these brahmans are set on the brahma worlds what if i were to teach dhana janin the brahman the path to union with the brahmas sariputta dhana janin the brahman has died and reappeared in the brahma world monks it is so you should train yourselves strong will be our desire for undertaking the training in heightened virtue strong will be our desire for undertaking the training in heightened mind concentration strong will be our desire for undertaking the training in heightened discernment that is how you should train yourselves in the same way the descendants who live in dependence on a clansman of conviction prosper in terms of three kinds of prosperity which three they prosper in terms of conviction they prosper in terms of virtue they prosper in terms of discernment the descendants who live in dependence on a clansman of conviction prosper in terms of these three kinds of prosperity like a mountain of rock in the wilderness in a mighty grove dependent on which there prosper lords of the forest great trees in the same way those who here live dependent on a clansman of conviction consummate in virtue prosper wife children friends dependents kin seeing the virtue of that virtuous one his liberality good conduct those who are perceptive follow suit having here in this world followed the dhamma the path to a good destination they delight in the world of the devas enjoying the pleasures they desire i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in the lord the monks replied the blessed one said this this is the direct path for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow lamentation for the disappearance of pain distress for the attainment of the right method for the realization of unbinding in other words the four frames of reference which four there is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in of itself ardent alert mindful putting aside greed distress with reference to the world he remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in of themselves ardent alert mindful putting aside greed distress with reference to the world and how does a monk remain focused on the body in of itself breathing in long he discerns i am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns i am breathing out long or breathing in short he discerns i am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns i am breathing out short he trains himself i will breathe in sensitive to the entire body he trains himself i will breathe out sensitive to the entire body he trains himself i will breathe in calming bodily fabrication he trains himself i will breathe out calming bodily fabrication in this way he remains focused internally on the body in of itself or externally on the body in of itself or both internally externally on the body in of itself or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body or on the phenomenon of origination passing away with regard to the body or his mindfulness that there is a body is maintained to the extent of knowledge remembrance and he remains independent unsustained by not clinging to anything in the world this is how a monk remains focused on the body in of itself in this way he remains focused internally on the body in of itself or focused externally unsustained by anything in the world this is how a monk remains focused on the body in of itself in this way he remains focused internally on the body in of itself or

connected with tendons bones detached from their tendons scattered in all directions here a hand bone there a foot bone here a shin bone there a thigh bone here a hip bone there a back bone here a rib there a breast bone here a shoulder bone there a neck bone here a jaw bone there a tooth here a skull the bones whitened somewhat like the color of shells piled up more than a year old decomposed into a powder he applies it to this very body this body too such is its nature such is its future such its unavoidable fate in this way he remains focused internally on the body in of itself or externally on the body in of itself or both internally externally on the body in of itself or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body or on the phenomenon of origination passing away with regard to the body or his mindfulness that there is a body is maintained to the extent of knowledge remembrance and he remains independent unsustained by not clinging to anything in the world this is how a monk remains focused on the body in of itself and how does a monk remain focused on feelings in of themselves there is the case where a monk when feeling a painful feeling discerns i am feeling a painful feeling when feeling a pleasant feeling he discerns i am feeling a pleasant feeling when feeling a neither painful nor pleasant feeling he discerns i am feeling a neither painful nor pleasant feeling when feeling a painful feeling of the flesh he discerns i am feeling a painful feeling of the flesh when feeling a

the phenomenon of origination with regard to feelings on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to feelings or on the phenomenon of origination passing away with regard to feelings or his mindfulness that there are feelings is maintained to the extent of knowledge remembrance and he remains independent unsustained by not clinging to anything in the world this is how a monk remains focused on feelings in of themselves and how does a monk remain focused on the mind in of itself there is the case where a monk when the mind has passion discerns that the mind has passion when the mind is without passion he discerns that the mind is without passion when the mind has aversion he discerns that the mind has aversion when the mind is without aversion he discerns that the mind is without aversion when the mind has delusion he discerns that the mind has delusion when the mind is without delusion he discerns that the mind is without delusion when the mind is restricted he

five clinging aggregates that in short are stress this is called the noble truth of stress and where does this craving when arising arise and where when dwelling does it dwell whatever seems endearing

evaluation of forms evaluation of sounds evaluation of smells evaluation of tastes evaluation of tactile sensations evaluation of ideas seems endearing and agreeable in terms of the world that is where this craving when arising arises that is where when dwelling it dwells this is called the noble truth of the origination of stress and where when being abandoned is this craving abandoned and

cessation of stress and what is right view knowledge with regard to stress knowledge with regard to the origination of stress knowledge with regard to the cessation of stress knowledge with regard to the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress this is called right view and what is right resolve aspiring to renunciation to freedom from ill will to harmlessness this is called right resolve and what is right speech abstaining from lying from divisive speech from abusive speech from idle chatter this is called right speech and what is right action abstaining from taking life from stealing from illicit sex this is called right action and what is right livelihood there is the case where a disciple of the noble ones having abandoned dishonest livelihood keeps his life going with right livelihood this is called right livelihood and what is right effort there is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors arouses persistence upholds exerts his intent for the sake of the non arising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the sake of the abandoning of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen and for the maintenance non confusion increase plenitude development culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen this is called right effort and what is right mindfulness there is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in of itself ardent alert mindful putting aside greed distress with reference to the world he remains focused on feelings in of themselves the mind in of itself mental qualities in of themselves ardent alert mindful putting aside greed distress with reference to the world this is called right mindfulness and what is right concentration there is the case where a monk quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress he enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain this is called right concentration this is called the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress in this way he remains focused internally on mental qualities in of themselves or externally on mental qualities in of themselves or both internally externally on mental qualities in of themselves or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to mental qualities on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to mental qualities or on the phenomenon of origination passing away with regard to mental qualities or his mindfulness that there are mental qualities is maintained to the extent of knowledge remembrance and he remains independent unsustained by not clinging to anything in the world this is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in of themselves with reference to the four noble truths now if anyone would develop these four frames of reference in this way for seven years one of two fruits can be expected for him either gnosis right here now or if there be any remnant of clinging sustenance non return let alone seven years if anyone would develop these four frames of reference in this way for six years five four three two years one year seven months six months five four three two months one month half a month one of two fruits can be expected for him either gnosis right here now or if there be any remnant of clinging sustenance non return let alone half a month if anyone would develop these four frames of reference in this way for seven days one of two fruits can be expected for him either gnosis right here now or if there be any remnant of clinging sustenance non return this is the direct path for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow lamentation for the disappearance of pain distress for the attainment of the right method for the realization of unbinding in other words the four frames of reference thus was it said and in reference to this was it said that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words on one occasion the blessed one was staying near savatthi in jeta s grove anathapindika s monastery and on that occasion the lay woman velukandaki nanda s mother had established a donation endowed with six factors for the community of monks headed by sariputta moggallana the blessed one saw with his divine eye surpassing the human that the laywoman velukandaki nanda s mother had established a donation endowed with six factors for the community of monks headed by sariputta moggallana on seeing this he addressed the monks monks the lay woman velukandaki nanda s mother has established a donation endowed with six factors for the community of monks headed by sariputta moggallana and how is a donation endowed with six factors there is the case where there are the three factors of the donor the three factors of the recipients and which are the three factors of the donor there is the case where the donor before giving is glad while giving his her mind is bright clear and after giving is gratified these are the three factors of the donor and which are the three factors of the recipients there is the case where the recipients are free of passion or are practicing for the subduing of passion free of aversion or practicing for the subduing of aversion and free of delusion or practicing for the subduing of delusion these are the three factors of the recipients such are the three factors of the donor the three factors of the recipients and this is how a donation is endowed with six factors and it is not easy to take the measure of the merit of a donation thus endowed with six factors as just this much a bonanza of merit a bonanza of what is skillful a nutriment of bliss heavenly resulting in bliss leading to heaven that leads to what is desirable pleasing charming beneficial pleasant it is simply reckoned as a great mass of merit incalculable immeasurable just as it is not easy to take the measure of the great ocean as just this many buckets of water just this many hundreds of buckets of water just this many thousands of buckets of water or just this many hundreds of thousands of buckets of water it is simply reckoned as a great mass of water incalculable immeasurable in the same way it is not easy to take the measure of the merit of a donation thus endowed with six factors as just this much a bonanza of merit a bonanza of what is skillful a nutriment of bliss heavenly resulting in bliss leading to heaven that leads to what is desirable pleasing charming beneficial pleasant it is simply reckoned as a great mass of merit incalculable immeasurable before giving glad while giving the mind is bright clear having given one is gratified this is the consummation of the sacrifice free of passion free of aversion free of delusion without fermentation the consummation of the field of the sacrifice one restrained leading the holy life i have heard that on one occasion while the blessed one was wandering among the mallans with a large community of monks he arrived at p v there he stayed near p v in the mango grove of cunda the silversmith cunda the silversmith heard the blessed one they say while wandering among the mallans with a large community of monks and reaching p v is staying near p v in my mango grove so cunda went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one instructed urged roused encouraged him with dhamma talk then cunda instructed urged roused encouraged by the blessed one s dhamma talk said to him lord may the blessed one acquiesce to my meal tomorrow together with the community of monks the blessed one acquiesced with silence then cunda understanding the blessed one s acquiescence got up from his seat bowed down to the blessed one and left circling him to the right then at the end of the night after having exquisite staple non staple food including a large amount of pig delicacythen the blessed one early in the morning adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl robes went together with the community of monks to cunda s home on arrival he sat down on the seat laid out seated he said to cunda cunda serve me with the pig delicacy you have had prepared and the community of monks with the other staple non staple food you have had prepared responding as you say lord to the blessed one cunda served the blessed one with the pig delicacy he had had prepared and the community of monks with the other staple non staple food he had had prepared then the blessed one said to him cunda bury the remaining pig delicacy in a pit i don t see anyone in the world together with its devas m ras brahmas with its people with their contemplatives brahmans their royalty commonfolk in whom when it was ingested it would go to a healthy change aside from the tath gata responding as you say lord to the blessed one cunda buried the remaining pig delicacy in a pit went to the blessed one and on arrival after bowing down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one after instructing urging rousing encouraging him with dhamma talk got up from his seat and left then in the blessed one after he had eaten cunda s meal there arose a severe illness accompanied with the passing of blood with intense pains deadly but the blessed one endured it mindful alert not struck down by it then he addressed ven nanda nanda we will go to kusinar as you say lord ven nanda responded to the blessed one i have heard that on eating cunda the silversmith s meal the enlightened one was touched by illness fierce deadly after he had eaten the pig delicacy a fierce sickness arose in the teacher after being purged of it the blessed one said to the city of kusinar i will go then the blessed one going down from the road went to a certain tree and on arrival said to ven nanda nanda please arrange my outer robe folded in four i am tired i will sit down responding as you say lord to the blessed one ven nanda arranged the outer robe folded in four the blessed one sat down on the seat laid out seated he said to ven nanda nanda please fetch me some water i am thirsty i will drink when this was said ven nanda said to the blessed one lord just now carts have passed through the meager river cut by the wheels flows turbid disturbed but the kuku a river is not far away with pristine water pleasing water cool water pellucid water a second time the blessed one said to ven nanda nanda please fetch me some water i am thirsty i will drink a second time ven nanda said to the blessed one lord just now carts have passed through the meager water cut by the wheels flows turbid disturbed but the kuku a river is not far away with pristine water pleasing water cool water pellucid water with restful banks refreshing there the blessed one will drink potable water and cool his limbs a third time the blessed one said to ven nanda nanda please fetch me some water i am thirsty i will drink responding as you say lord to the blessed one ven nanda taking a bowl went to the river and the meager river that cut by the wheels had been flowing turbid disturbed on his approach flowed pristine clear undisturbed the thought occurred to him how amazing how astounding the great power great might of the tath gata in that this meager river that cut by the wheels was flowing turbid disturbed on my approach flowed pristine clear undisturbed fetching water with the bowl he went to the blessed one and on arrival said how amazing how astounding the great power great might of the tath gata in that this meager river that cut by the wheels was flowing turbid disturbed on my approach flowed pristine clear undisturbed drink the water o blessed one drink the water o one well gone then the blessed one drank the water then the blessed one together with the community of monks went to the kuku a river and after arriving at the kuku a river going down bathing drinking coming back out went to a mango grove on arrival the blessed one said to ven cundaka cundaka please arrange my outer robe folded in four i am tired i will lie down responding as you say lord to the blessed one ven cundaka arranged the outer robe folded in four the blessed one lying on his right side took up the lion s posture placing one foot on top of the other mindful alert and attending to the perception of getting up ven cundaka sat in front of him the awakened one having gone to the little kuku a river with its pristine pleasing water clear the teacher seeming very tired the tath gata unequalled in the world went down bathed drank came out honored surrounded in the midst of the group of monks the blessed one teacher proceeding here in the dhamma the great seer went to the mango grove he addressed the monk named cundaka spread it out folded in four for me to lie down ordered by the one of developed mind cundaka quickly set it out folded in four the teacher lay down seeming very tired and cundaka sat down there before him then the blessed one addressed ven nanda nanda if anyone tries to incite remorse in cunda the silversmith saying it s no gain for you friend cunda it s ill done by you that the tath gata having eaten your last alms was totally unbound then cunda s remorse should be allayed in this way it s a gain for you friend cunda it s well done by you that the tath gata having eaten your last alms was totally unbound face to face with the blessed one have i heard it face to face have i learned it these two alms are equal to each other in fruit equal to each other in result of much greater fruit reward than any other alms which two the alms that after having eaten it the tath gata awakens to the unexcelled right self awakening and the alms that after having eaten it the tath gata is unbound by means of the unbinding property with no fuel remaining then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed for a person giving merit increases for one self restraining no animosity is amassed one who is skillful leaves evil behind and from the ending of passion aversion delusion is totally unbound see also on one occasion ven sariputta and ven maha kotthita were staying near varanasi in the game refuge at isipatana then in the evening ven maha kotthita emerged from his seclusion and went to ven sariputta and exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to ven sariputta now then friend sariputta does the tathagata exist after death that friend has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata exists after death well then friend sariputta does the tathagata not exist after death friend that too has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata does not exist after death then does the tathagata both exist and not exist after death that has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death well then does the tathagata neither exist nor not exist after death that too has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death now friend sariputta when asked if the tathagata exists after death you say that has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata exists after death when asked if the tathagata does not exist after death both exists and does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death you say that too has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death now what is the cause what is the reason why that has not been declared by the blessed one for one who does not know see form as it actually is present who does not know see the origination of form the cessation of form the path of practice leading to the cessation of form as it actually is present there occurs the thought the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death for one who does not know see feeling as it actually is present for one who does not know see perception as it actually is present for one who does not know see fabrications as they actually are present for one who does not know see consciousness as it actually is present who does not know see the origination of consciousness the cessation of consciousness the path of practice leading to the cessation of consciousness as it actually is present there occurs the thought the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death but for one who knows sees form as it actually is present who knows sees the origination of form the cessation of form the path of practice leading to the cessation of form as it actually is present the thought the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death doesn t occur for one who knows sees feeling as it actually is present for one who knows sees perception as it actually is present for one who knows sees fabrications as they actually are present for one who knows sees consciousness as it actually is present who knows sees the origination of consciousness the cessation of consciousness the path of practice leading to the cessation of consciousness as it actually is present the thought the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death doesn t occur this is the cause this is the reason why that has not been declared by the blessed one then and what is the bliss of having there is the case where the son of a good family has wealth earned through his efforts enterprise amassed through the strength of his arm and piled up through the sweat of his brow righteous wealth righteously gained when he thinks i have wealth earned through my efforts enterprise amassed through the strength of my arm and piled up through the sweat of my brow righteous wealth righteously gained he experiences bliss he experiences joy this is called the bliss of having and what is the bliss of making use of wealth there is the case where the son of a good family using the wealth earned through his efforts enterprise amassed through the strength of his arm and piled up through the sweat of his brow righteous wealth righteously gained partakes of his wealth and makes merit when he thinks using the wealth earned through my efforts enterprise amassed through the strength of my arm and piled up through the sweat of my brow righteous wealth righteously gained i partake of wealth and make merit he experiences bliss he experiences joy this is called the bliss of making use of wealth and what is the bliss of debtlessness there is the case where the son of a good family owes no debt great or small to anyone at all when he thinks i owe no debt great or small to anyone at all he experiences bliss he experiences joy this is called the bliss of debtlessness and what is the bliss of blamelessness there is the case where a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with blameless bodily kamma blameless verbal kamma blameless mental kamma when he thinks i am endowed with blameless bodily kamma blameless verbal kamma blameless mental kamma he experiences bliss he experiences joy this is called the bliss of blamelessness these are the four kinds of bliss that can be attained in the proper season on the proper occasions by a householder partaking of sensuality knowing the bliss of debtlessness recollecting the bliss of having enjoying the bliss of wealth the mortal then sees clearly with discernment seeing clearly the wise one he knows both sides that these are not worth one sixteenth sixteenth of the bliss of blamelessness monks for one whose awareness release through good will is cultivated developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated and well undertaken eleven benefits can be expected which eleven one sleeps easily wakes easily dreams no evil dreams one is dear to human beings dear to non human beings the devas protect one neither fire poison nor weapons can touch one one s mind gains concentration quickly one s complexion is bright one dies unconfused and if penetrating no higher is headed for the brahma worlds these are the eleven benefits that can be expected for one whose awareness release through good will is cultivated developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated and well undertaken monks i will teach you the feeding starving of the five hindrances of the seven factors for awakening listen pay close attention i will speak feeding the hindrances and what is the food for the arising of unarisen and what is the food for the arising of unarisen and what is the food for the arising of unarisen and what is the food for the arising of unarisen and what is the food for the arising of unarisen feeding the factors for awakening now what is the food for the arising of unarisen and what is the food for the arising of unarisen

of food for the arising of unarisen and what is lack of food for the arising of unarisen and what is lack of food for the arising of unarisen i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at as you say lord the monks replied the blessed one said now what monks is five factored noble right concentration there is the case where a monk quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluation he permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal furthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhana rapture and pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation internal assurance he permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composure there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of composure and furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding he permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture and furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure and stress as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain he sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awareness and furthermore the monk has his theme of reflection well in hand well attended to well considered well tuned when a monk has developed and pursued the five factored noble right concentration in this way then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know and realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening yes lord in the same way when a monk has developed and pursued the five factored noble right concentration in this way then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know and realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening yes lord in the same way when a monk has developed and pursued the five factored noble right concentration in this way then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know and realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants he wields manifold if he wants he hears by means of the divine ear element purified and surpassing the human both kinds of sounds divine and human whether near or far he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants he knows the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with his own awareness he discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passion he discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion he discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion he discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind and a scattered mind as a scattered mind he discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mind he discerns an excelled mind if he wants he recollects his manifold past lives if he wants he sees by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human beings passing away and re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma these beings who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell but these beings who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world thus by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human he sees beings passing away and re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants then through the ending of the mental effluents he remains in the effluent free awareness release discernment release having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here and now he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near savatthi in jeta s grove anathapindika s monastery and on that occasion anathapindika the householder was diseased in pain severely ill then anathapindika the householder said to one of his men come

sitting there he said lord anathapindika the householder is diseased in pain severely ill he pays homage with his head to the blessed one s feet then he went to ven sariputta and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one side as he was sitting there he said venerable sir anathapindika the householder is diseased in pain severely ill he pays homage with his head to ven sariputta s feet then he said it would be good if ven sariputta would visit anathapindika s home out of sympathy for him ven sariputta acquiesced through silence then ven sariputta having put on his robes and taking his bowl outer robe went to the home of anathapindika the householder with anathapindika i am not getting better venerable sir i am not comfortable my severe pains are increasing not lessening there are signs of their increasing and not of their lessening extreme forces slice through my head just as if a strong man were slicing my head open with a sharp sword extreme pains have arisen in my head just as if

anathapindika the householder wept and shed tears ven ananda said to him are you sinking householder are you foundering no venerable sir i m not sinking nor am i foundering it s just that for a long time i have attended to the teacher and to the monks who inspire my heart but never before have i heard a talk on the dhamma like this this sort of talk on the dhamma householder is not given to lay people clad in white this sort of talk on the dhamma is given to those gone forth in that case ven sariputta please let this sort of talk on the dhamma be given to lay people clad in white there are clansmen with little dust in their eyes who are wasting away through not hearing this dhamma there will be those who will understand it this blessed jeta s grove home to the community of seers where there dwells the dhamma king the source of rapture for me action clear knowing mental qualities that is what anathapindika the deva s son said the teacher approved then anathapindika the deva s son knowing the teacher has approved of me bowed down to him circled him three times keeping him to his right and then disappeared right there then when the night had past the blessed one addressed the monks last night monks a certain deva s son in the far extreme of the night his extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of jeta s grove came to me and on arrival bowed down to me and stood to one side as he was standing there he addressed me with this verse this blessed jeta s grove home to the community of seers where there dwells the dhamma king the source of rapture for me action clear knowing mental qualities virtue the highest way of life through this are mortals purified not through clan or wealth thus the wise seeing their own benefit investigating the dhamma appropriately should purify themselves right there as for sariputta any monk who has gone beyond at best can only equal him in discernment virtue calm that is what the deva s son said and thinking the teacher has approved of me he bowed down to me circled me three times and then disappeared right there when this was said ven ananda said to the blessed one lord that must have been anathapindika the deva s son anathapindika the householder had supreme confidence in ven sariputta very good ananda very good to the extent that you have deduced what can be arrived at through logic that that is what the blessed one said gratified ven ananda delighted in the blessed one s words monks there are these there is the case where an individual withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation he regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness not self at the break up of the body after death he reappears in conjunction with the devas of the pure abodes this rebirth is not in common with run of the mill people again there is the case where an individual enters the second jhana the third jhana the fourth jhana he regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness not self at the break up of the body after death he reappears in conjunction with the devas of the pure abodes this rebirth is not in common with run of the mill people these are four types of individuals to be found existing in the world monks do not wage wordy warfare saying you don t understand this dhamma and discipline why should you not do this such talk monks is not related to the goal it is not fundamental to the holy life does not conduce to disenchantment dispassion cessation tranquillity higher knowledge enlightenment or to nibbana when you have discussions monks you should discuss suffering the arising of suffering its cessation and the path that leads to its cessation why is that because such talk is related to the goal it conduces to disenchantment to nibbana this is the task you must accomplish then uttiya the wanderer went to the blessed one and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one master gotama is it the case that uttiya i haven t declared that very well then master gotama is it the case that uttiya i haven t declared that very well then master gotama is it the case that uttiya i haven t declared that but master gotama on being asked is it the case that uttiya having directly known it i teach the dhamma to my disciples for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow lamentation for the disappearance of pain distress for the attainment of the right method for the realization of unbinding and master gotama when having directly known it you teach the dhamma to your disciples for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow lamentation for the disappearance of pain distress for the attainment of the right method for the realization of unbinding will all the cosmos be led to release or a half of it or a third when this was said the blessed one was silent then the thought occurred to in the same way the tathagata isn t concerned with whether all the cosmos or half of it or a third of it will be led to release by means of that dhamma but he does know this all those who have been led are being led or will be led to release from the cosmos have done so are doing so or will do so after having abandoned the five hindrances those defilements of awareness that weaken discernment having well established setting at savatthi then in the morning the bhikkhuni sela dressed she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day s abiding then mara the evil one desiring to arouse fear trepidation and terror in the bhikkhuni sela desiring to make her fall away from concentration approached her and addressed her in verse by whom has this puppet been created where is the maker of the puppet where has the puppet arisen where does the puppet cease then it occurred to the bhikkhuni sela now who is this this is mara the evil one desiring to make me fall away from concentration then the bhikkhuni sela having understood this is mara the evil one replied to him in verses this puppet is not made by itself nor is this misery made by another it has come to be dependent on a cause when the cause dissolves then it will cease as when a seed is sown in a field it grows depending on a pair of factors it requires both the soil s nutrients and a steady supply of moisture just so the aggregates and elements and these six bases of sensory contact have come to be dependent on a cause when the cause dissolves they will cease then mara the evil one realizing the bhikkhuni sela knows me sad and disappointed disappeared right there at savatthi as he was sitting to one side king pasenadi kosala said to the blessed one is there

amassed vyagghapajja has four sources of destruction there are four sources for the increase of amassed wealth just as in the case of a great tank with four inlets and four outlets if a person were to open the inlets and close the outlets and there should also be adequate rainfall an increase in water is certainly to be expected in that tank and not a decrease even so these four conditions are the sources of increase of amassed wealth these four conditions vyagghapajja are conducive to a householder s weal and happiness in this very life conditions of spiritual progress four conditions

one of two fruitions is proper to be expected knowledge here and now or if some form of clinging is yet present the state of non returning because of this was it said this is the only way o bhikkhus for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation for the destruction of suffering and grief for reaching the right path for the attainment of nibbana namely the four arousings of mindfulness thus spoke the blessed one satisfied the bhikkhus approved of his words on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the magadhans at andhakavinda then ven ananda went to him and having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him ananda the new monks those who have not long gone forth who are newcomers in this dhamma discipline should be encouraged exhorted and established in these five things which five come friends be virtuous dwell restrained in accordance with the patimokkha consummate in your behavior sphere of activity

limited conversation come friends dwell in the come friends develop right view be endowed with right vision thus they should be encouraged exhorted established in right vision new monks those who have not long gone forth who are newcomers in this dhamma discipline should be encouraged exhorted and established in these five things on one occasion a certain monk a i live in the wilderness all alone like a log cast away in the forest on a night like this who could there be more miserable than me then the devata inhabiting the forest thicket feeling sympathy for the monk desiring his benefit desiring to bring him to his senses approached him and addressed him with this verse as you live in the wilderness all alone like a log cast away in the forest many are those who envy you as hell beings do those headed for heaven the monk chastened by the devata came to his senses i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near monks i have made this simile to convey a meaning here the meaning is this the four vipers of utmost heat horrible venom stands for the four great existents the earth property the liquid property the fire property the wind property the five enemy executioners stands for the five clinging aggregates the form clinging aggregate the feeling clinging aggregate the perception clinging aggregate the fabrications clinging aggregate the consciousness clinging aggregate the sixth fellow traveling executioner with upraised sword stands for passion delight the great expanse of water stands for the fourfold flood the flood of sensuality the flood of becoming the flood of views the flood of ignorance the near shore dubious risky stands for self identification the further shore secure and free from risk stands for unbinding the raft stands for just this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration making an effort with hands feet stands for the arousing of persistence crossed over having gone to the other shore he would stand on high ground a brahman stands for the arahant monks there are these three roots of what is unskillful which three greed is a root of what is unskillful aversion is a root of what is unskillful delusion is a root of what is unskillful greed itself is unskillful whatever a greedy person fabricates by means of body speech or intellect that too is unskillful whatever suffering a greedy person his mind overcome with greed his mind consumed wrongly inflicts on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment with the thought i have power i want power that too is unskillful thus it is that many evil unskillful qualities events born of greed caused by greed originated through greed conditioned by greed come into play aversion itself is unskillful whatever an aversive person fabricates by means of body speech or intellect that too is unskillful whatever suffering an aversive person his mind overcome with aversion his mind consumed wrongly inflicts on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment with the thought i have power i want power that too is unskillful thus it is that many evil unskillful qualities born of aversion caused by aversion originated through aversion conditioned by aversion come into play delusion itself is unskillful whatever a deluded person fabricates by means of body speech or intellect that too is unskillful whatever suffering a deluded person his mind overcome with delusion his mind consumed wrongly inflicts on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment with the thought i have power i want power that too is unskillful thus it is that many evil unskillful qualities born of delusion caused by delusion originated through delusion conditioned by delusion come into play and a person like this is called one who speaks at the wrong time speaks what is unfactual speaks what is irrelevant speaks contrary to the dhamma speaks contrary to the vinaya why because of having wrongly inflicted suffering on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment with the thought i have power i want power when told what is factual he denies it and doesn t acknowledge it when told what is unfactual he doesn t make an ardent effort to untangle it to see this is unfactual this is baseless that s why a person like this is called one who speaks at the wrong time speaks what is unfactual speaks what is irrelevant speaks contrary to the dhamma speaks contrary to the vinaya a person like this his mind overcome with evil unskillful qualities born of greed born of aversion born of delusion his mind consumed dwells in suffering right in the here now feeling threatened turbulent feverish and at the break up of the body after death can expect a bad destination just as a sal tree a birch or an aspen when smothered surrounded by three parasitic vines falls into misfortune falls into disaster falls into misfortune disaster in the same way a person like this his mind overcome with evil unskillful qualities born of greed born of aversion born of delusion his mind consumed dwells in suffering right in the here now feeling threatened turbulent feverish and at the break up of the body after death can expect a bad destination these are the three roots of what is unskillful now there are these three roots of what is skillful which three lack of greed is a root of what is skillful lack of aversion is a root of what is skillful lack of delusion is a root of what is skillful lack of greed itself is skillful whatever an ungreedy person fabricates by means of body speech or intellect that too is skillful whatever suffering an ungreedy person his mind not overcome with greed his mind not consumed does not wrongly inflict on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment with the thought i have power i want power that too is skillful thus it is that many skillful qualities born of lack of greed caused by lack of greed originated through lack of greed conditioned by lack of greed come into play lack of aversion itself is skillful lack of delusion itself is skillful whatever an undeluded person fabricates by means of body speech or intellect that too is skillful whatever suffering an undeluded person his mind not overcome with delusion his mind not consumed does not wrongly inflict on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment with the thought i have power i want power that too is skillful thus it is that many skillful qualities born of lack of delusion caused by lack of delusion originated through lack of delusion conditioned by lack of delusion come into play and a person like this is called one who speaks at the right time speaks what is factual speaks what is relevant speaks in line with the dhamma speaks in line with the vinaya why because of not having wrongly inflicted suffering on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment with the thought i have power i want power when told what is factual he acknowledges it and does not deny it when told what is unfactual he makes an ardent effort to untangle it to see this is unfactual this is baseless that s why a person like this is called one who speaks at the right time speaks what is factual speaks what is relevant speaks in line with the dhamma speaks in line with the vinaya in a person like this evil unskillful qualities born of greed born of aversion born of delusion have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising he dwells in ease right in the here now feeling unthreatened placid unfeverish and is unbound right in the here now just as if there were a sal tree a birch or an aspen smothered surrounded by three parasitic vines a man would come along carrying a spade a basket he would cut the vines at the root and having cut them at the root would dig around them having dug around them he would pull them out even down to the rootlets he would cut the stalks of the vines having cut them he would slice them into splinters having sliced them into splinters he would pound them into bits having pounded them into bits he would dry them in the wind sun having dried them in the wind sun he would burn them in a fire having burned them in a fire he would reduce them to powdered ash having reduced them to powdered ash he would winnow them before a high wind or let them be washed away in a swift flowing stream in that way the parasitic vines would have their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising in the same way in a person like this evil unskillful qualities born of greed born of aversion born of delusion have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising he dwells in ease right in the here now feeling unthreatened placid unfeverish and is unbound right in the here now these are the three roots of what is skillful once the blessed one was staying among the now it may be that you are thinking nakula s mother will not be able to support the children or maintain the household after i m gone but you shouldn t see things in that way i am skilled at spinning cotton at carding matted wool i can support the children and maintain the household after you are gone so don t be worried as you die householder death is painful for one who is worried the blessed one has criticized being worried at the time of death now it may be that you are thinking nakula s mother will take another husband after i m gone but you shouldn t see things in that way you know as well as i how my fidelity now it may be that you are thinking nakula s mother will have no desire to go see the blessed one to go see the community of monks after i m gone but you shouldn t see things in that way i will have an even greater desire to go see the blessed one to go see the community of monks after you are gone so don t be worried as you die householder death is painful for one who is worried the blessed one has criticized being worried at the time of death now it may be that you are thinking nakula s mother will not act fully in accordance with the precepts after i m gone but you shouldn t see things in that way to the extent that the blessed one has white clad householder female disciples who act fully in accordance with the precepts i am one of them if anyone doubts or denies this let him go ask the blessed one the worthy one the rightly self awakened one who is staying among the bhaggas in the deer park at bhesakala grove near crocodile haunt so don t be worried as you die householder death is painful for one who is worried the blessed one has criticized being worried at the time of death now it may be that you are thinking nakula s mother will not attain inner tranquillity of awareness after i m gone but you shouldn t see things in that way to the extent that the blessed one has white clad householder female disciples who attain inner tranquillity of awareness i am one of them if anyone doubts or denies this let him go ask the blessed one the worthy one the rightly self awakened one who is staying among the bhaggas in the deer park at bhesakala grove near crocodile haunt so don t be worried as you die householder death is painful for one who is worried the blessed one has criticized being worried at the time of death now it may be that you are thinking nakula s mother will not reach firm ground in this doctrine discipline will not attain a firm foothold will not attain consolation overcome her doubts dispel her perplexity reach fearlessness or gain independence from others with regard to the teacher s message while nakula s father the householder was being exhorted by nakula s mother with this exhortation his disease was immediately allayed and he recovered from his disease that was how nakula s father s disease was abandoned then soon after nakula s father the householder had recovered from being sick not long after his recovery from his illness he went leaning on a stick to the blessed one on arrival having bowed down to the blessed one he sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him it is your gain your great gain householder that you have nakula s mother sympathetic wishing for your welfare as your counselor instructor to the extent that i have white clad householder female disciples who act fully in accordance with the precepts she is one of them to the extent that i have white clad householder female disciples who attain inner tranquillity of awareness she is one of them to the extent that i have white clad householder female disciples who reach firm ground in this doctrine discipline attain a firm foothold attain consolation overcome their doubts dispel their perplexity reach fearlessness gain independence from others with regard to the teacher s message she is one of them it is your gain your great gain householder that you have nakula s mother sympathetic wishing for your welfare as your counselor instructor monks these two slander the tathagata which two he who explains what was not said or spoken by the tathagata as said or spoken by the tathagata and he who explains what was said or spoken by the tathagata as not said or spoken by the tathagata these are two who slander the tathagata staying at savatthi the blessed one said what one intends what one arranges and what one obsesses about if one doesn t intend and doesn t arrange but one still obsesses about something this is a support for the stationing of consciousness there being a support there is a landing of consciousness when that consciousness lands and grows there is the production of renewed becoming in the future when there is the production of renewed becoming in the future there is future birth aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair such too is the origination of this entire mass of suffering stress but when one doesn t intend arrange or obsess about anything there is no support for the stationing of consciousness there being no support there is no landing of consciousness when that consciousness doesn t land grow there is no production of renewed becoming in the future when there is no production of renewed becoming in the future there is no future birth aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair such is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering stress at savatthi monks intention for forms is inconstant changeable alterable intention for sounds intention for smells intention for tastes intention for tactile sensations intention for ideas is inconstant changeable alterable one who has conviction belief that these phenomena are this way is called a faith follower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the run of the mill he is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry shades he is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry one who after pondering with a modicum of discernment has accepted that these phenomena are this way is called a dhamma follower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the run of the mill he is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry shades he is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry one who knows and sees that these phenomena are this way is called a stream enterer steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for self awakening if nobody is to be found in front of one or behind one that is exceedingly pleasant for the lonely forest dweller so be it i will go alone to the forest praised by buddha for the self resolute bhikkhu dwelling alone it is pleasant pleasing and joyful to sages haunted by rutting elephants seeking my goal alone quickly will i go to the wild forest in the well flowered cool garden in a soothing mountain grotto having anointed all my limbs i will walk back and forth alone when indeed shall i come to dwell all alone without companion in the great forest so pleasing my task accomplished without taint while the gentle breezes flutter soothing and laden with fragrance i ll burst asunder ignorance while seated on the mountain top in a grove covered with flowers or maybe on a cool hillside gladdened by the joy of release i ll be content on vultures peak i will teach you a dhamma discourse on bondage lack of bondage listen pay close attention i will speak yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said a woman attends inwardly to her feminine faculties her feminine gestures her feminine manners feminine poise feminine desires feminine voice feminine charms she is excited by that delighted by that being excited delighted by that she attends outwardly to masculine faculties masculine gestures masculine manners masculine poise masculine desires masculine voices masculine charms she is excited by that delighted by that being excited delighted by that she wants to be bonded to what is outside her wants whatever pleasure happiness that arise based on that bond delighting caught up in her femininity a woman goes into bondage with reference to men this is how a woman does not transcend her femininity a man attends inwardly to his masculine faculties masculine gestures masculine manners masculine poise masculine desires masculine voice masculine charms he is excited by that delighted by that being excited delighted by that he attends outwardly to feminine faculties feminine gestures feminine manners feminine poise feminine desires feminine voices feminine charms he is excited by that delighted by that being excited delighted by that he wants to be bonded to what is outside him wants whatever pleasure happiness that arise based on that bond delighting caught up in his masculinity a man goes into bondage with reference to women this is how a man does not transcend his masculinity and how is there lack of bondage a woman does not attend inwardly to her feminine faculties feminine charms she is not excited by that not delighted by that does not attend outwardly to masculine faculties masculine charms she is not excited by that not delighted by that does not want to be bonded to what is outside her does not want whatever pleasure happiness that arise based on that bond not delighting not caught up in her femininity a woman does not go into bondage with reference to men this is how a woman transcends her femininity a man does not attend inwardly to his masculine faculties masculine charms he is

him does not want whatever pleasure happiness that arise based on that bond not delighting not caught up in his masculinity a man does not go into bondage with reference to women this is how a man transcends his masculinity this is how there is lack of bondage and this is the dhamma discourse on bondage lack of bondage i have heard that at one time the blessed one was staying at then gotami the qualities of which you may know these qualities lead to passion not to dispassion to being fettered not to being unfettered to accumulating not to shedding to self aggrandizement not to modesty to discontent not to contentment to entanglement not to seclusion to laziness not to aroused persistence to being burdensome not to being unburdensome you may categorically hold this is not the dhamma this is not the vinaya this is not the teacher s instruction as for the qualities of which you may know these qualities lead to dispassion not to passion to being unfettered not to being fettered to shedding not to accumulating to modesty not to self aggrandizement to contentment not to discontent to seclusion not to entanglement to aroused persistence not to laziness to being unburdensome not to being burdensome you may categorically hold this is the dhamma this is the vinaya this is the teacher s instruction that is what the blessed one said gratified mahapajapati gotami delighted at his words i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near savatthi in jeta s grove anathapindika s monastery then those with children delight because of their children those with cattle delight because of their cows a person s delight comes from acquisitions since a person with no acquisitions doesn t delight then mara the evil one sad dejected at realizing the blessed one knows me the one well gone knows me vanished right there the buddha now at that time the blessed one was sitting exchanging courtesies conversation with some very senior brahmans it so happened that a brahman student named when this was said the brahman then the thought occurred to the blessed one yes this brahman student kapadika must be accomplished in the texts of the three vedas inasmuch as the brahmans honor him so then the thought occurred to kapadika when gotama the contemplative meets my gaze with his i will ask him a question and so the blessed one encompassing kapadika s awareness with his awareness met his gaze kapadika thought gotama the contemplative has turned to me suppose i ask him a question so he said to the blessed one master gotama with regard to the ancient hymns of the brahmans passed down through oral transmission included in their canon the brahmans have come to the definite conclusion that only this is true anything else is worthless what does master gotama have to say to this tell me bharadvaja is there among the brahmans even one brahman who says this i know this i see only this is true anything else is worthless no master gotama and has there been among the brahmans even one teacher or teacher s teacher back through seven generations who said this i know this i see only this is true anything else is worthless no master gotama and among the brahman seers of the past the creators of the hymns the composers of the hymns those ancient hymns sung repeated collected which brahmans at present still sing still chant repeating what was said repeating what was spoken i e no master gotama so then bharadvaja it seems that there isn t among the brahmans even one brahman who says this i know this i see only this is true anything else is worthless and there hasn t been among the brahmans even one teacher or teacher s teacher back through seven generations who said this i know this i see only this is true anything else is worthless and there hasn t been among the brahman seers of the past the creators of the hymns the composers of the hymns even one who said this we know this we see only this is true anything else is worthless it s not only out of conviction master gotama that the brahmans honor this they also honor it as unbroken tradition bharadvaja first you went by conviction now you speak of unbroken tradition there are five things that can turn out in two ways in the here now which five conviction liking unbroken tradition reasoning by analogy an agreement through pondering views these are the five things that can turn out in two ways in the here now now some things are firmly held in conviction and yet vain empty false some things are not firmly held in conviction and yet they are genuine factual unmistaken some things are well liked truly an unbroken tradition well reasoned some things are well pondered and yet vain empty false some things are not well pondered and yet they are genuine factual unmistaken in these cases it isn t proper for a knowledgeable person who safeguards the truth to come to a definite conclusion only this is true anything else is worthless but to what extent master gotama is there the safeguarding of the truth to what extent does one safeguard the truth we ask master gotama about the safeguarding of the truth if a person has conviction his statement this is my conviction safeguards the truth but he doesn t yet come to the definite conclusion that only this is true anything else is worthless to this extent bharadvaja there is the safeguarding of the truth to this extent one safeguards the truth i describe this as the safeguarding of the truth but it is not yet an awakening to the truth if a person likes something holds an unbroken tradition has something reasoned through analogy has something he agrees to having pondered views his statement this is what i agree to having pondered views safeguards the truth but he doesn t yet come to the definite conclusion that only this is true anything else is worthless to this extent bharadvaja there is the safeguarding of the truth to this extent one safeguards the truth i describe this as the safeguarding of the truth but it is not yet an awakening to the truth yes master gotama to this extent there is the safeguarding of the truth to this extent one safeguards the truth we regard this as the safeguarding of the truth but to what extent is there an awakening to the truth to what extent does one awaken to the truth we ask master gotama about awakening to the truth there is the case bharadvaja where a monk lives in dependence on a certain village or town then a householder or householder s son goes to him and observes him with regard to three mental qualities qualities based on greed qualities based on aversion qualities based on delusion are there in this venerable one any such qualities based on greed that with his mind overcome by these qualities he might say i know while not knowing or say i see while not seeing or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for his her long term harm pain as he observes him he comes to know there are in this venerable one no such qualities based on greed his bodily behavior verbal behavior are those of one not greedy and the dhamma he teaches is deep hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle to be experienced by the wise this dhamma can t easily be taught by a person who s greedy when on observing that the monk is purified with regard to qualities based on greed he next observes him with regard to qualities based on aversion are there in this venerable one any such qualities based on aversion that with his mind overcome by these qualities he might say i know while not knowing or say i see while not seeing or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for his her long term harm pain as he observes him he comes to know there are in this venerable one no such qualities based on aversion his bodily behavior verbal behavior are those of one not aversive and the dhamma he teaches is deep hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle to be experienced by the wise this dhamma can t easily be taught by a person who s aversive when on observing that the monk is purified with regard to qualities based on aversion he next observes him with regard to qualities based on delusion are there in this venerable one any such qualities based on delusion that with his mind overcome by these qualities he might say i know while not knowing or say i see while not seeing or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for his her long term harm pain as he observes him he comes to know there are in this venerable one no such qualities based on delusion his bodily behavior verbal behavior are those of one not deluded and the dhamma he teaches is deep hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle to be experienced by the wise this dhamma can t easily be taught by a person who s deluded when on observing that the monk is purified with regard to qualities based on delusion he places conviction in him with the arising of conviction he visits him grows close to him growing close to him he lends ear lending ear he hears the dhamma hearing the dhamma he remembers it remembering it he penetrates the meaning of those dhammas penetrating the meaning he comes to an agreement through pondering those dhammas there being an agreement through pondering those dhammas desire arises with the arising of desire he becomes willing willing he contemplates lit weighs compares contemplating he makes an exertion exerting himself he both realizes the ultimate meaning of the truth with his body and sees by penetrating it with discernment to this extent bharadvaja there is an awakening to the truth to this extent one awakens to the truth i describe this as an awakening to the truth but it is not yet the final attainment of the truth yes master gotama to this extent there is an awakening to the truth to this extent one awakens to the truth we regard this as an awakening to the truth but to what extent is there the final attainment of the truth to what extent does one finally attain the truth we ask master gotama about the final attainment of the truth the cultivation development pursuit of those very same qualities to this extent bharadvaja there is the final attainment of the truth to this extent one finally attains the truth i describe this as the final attainment of the truth yes master gotama to this extent there is the final attainment of the truth to this extent one finally attains the truth we regard this as the final attainment of the truth but what quality is most helpful for the final attainment of the truth we ask master gotama about the quality most helpful for the final attainment of the truth but what quality is most helpful for exertion we ask master gotama about the quality most helpful for exertion contemplating is most helpful for exertion bharadvaja if one didn t contemplate one wouldn t make an exertion because one contemplates one makes an exertion therefore contemplating is most helpful for exertion but what quality is most helpful for contemplating being willing if one weren t willing one wouldn t contemplate but what quality is most helpful for being willing desire if desire didn t arise one wouldn t be willing but what quality is most helpful for desire coming to an agreement through pondering dhammas if one didn t come to an agreement through pondering dhammas desire wouldn t arise but what quality is most helpful for coming to an agreement through pondering dhammas penetrating the meaning if one didn t penetrate the meaning one wouldn t come to an agreement through pondering dhammas but what quality is most helpful for penetrating the meaning remembering the dhamma if one didn t remember the dhamma one wouldn t penetrate the meaning but what quality is most helpful for remembering the dhamma hearing the dhamma if one didn t hear the dhamma one wouldn t remember the dhamma but what quality is most helpful for hearing the dhamma lending ear if one didn t lend ear one wouldn t hear the dhamma but what quality is most helpful for lending ear growing close if one didn t grow close one wouldn t lend ear but what quality is most helpful for growing close visiting if one didn t visit one wouldn t grow close but what quality is most helpful for visiting we ask master gotama about the quality most helpful for visiting conviction is most helpful for visiting bharadvaja if conviction in a person didn t arise one wouldn t visit that person because conviction arises one visits therefore conviction is most helpful for visiting we have asked master gotama about safeguarding the truth and master gotama has answered about safeguarding the truth we like that agree with that we used to think who are these bald headed contemplatives these menial dark offspring of brahma the kinsman s feet i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at the blessed one responded i do not say brahman that everything that has been seen should be spoken about nor do i say that everything that has been seen should not be spoken about i do not say that everything that has been heard everything that has been sensed everything that has been cognized should be spoken about nor do i say that everything that has been cognized should not be spoken about when for one who speaks of what has been seen unskillful mental qualities increase and skillful mental qualities decrease then that sort of thing should not be spoken about but when for one who speaks of what has been seen unskillful mental qualities decrease and skillful mental qualities increase then that sort of thing should be spoken about when for one who speaks of what has been heard what has been sensed what has been cognized unskillful mental qualities increase and skillful mental qualities decrease then that sort of thing should not be spoken about but when for one who speaks of what has been cognized unskillful mental qualities decrease and skillful mental qualities increase then that sort of thing should be spoken about then vassakara the brahman delighting rejoicing in the blessed one s words got up from his seat and left last night monks a certain devata in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of jeta s grove came to me and on arrival bowed down to me and stood to one side as she was standing there she said to me these seven qualities lord lead to a monk s non decline which seven respect for the teacher respect for the dhamma respect for the sangha respect for training respect for concentration respect for shame respect for compunction these seven qualities lord lead to a monk s non decline that is what that devata said having said it she bowed down to me circled me three times and then disappeared right there respecting the teacher respecting the dhamma and with fierce respect for the sangha respecting concentration ardent and with fierce respect for training consummate in shame compunction deferential respectful incapable of decline one is right in the presence of unbinding staying at savatthi suppose monks that the great ocean were to go to extinction to its total end except for two or three drops of water what do you think which would be greater the water in the great ocean that had gone to extinction to its total end or the two or three remaining drops of water lord the water in the great ocean that had gone to extinction to its total end would be far greater the two or three remaining drops of water would be next to nothing they wouldn t be a hundredth a thousandth a one hundred thousandth the two or three remaining drops of water when compared with the water in the great ocean that had gone to extinction to its total end i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said monks ignorance is the leader in the attainment of unskillful qualities followed by lack of conscience lack of concern in an unknowledgeable person immersed in ignorance wrong view arises in one of wrong view wrong resolve arises in one of wrong resolve wrong speech in one of wrong speech wrong action in one of wrong action wrong livelihood in one of wrong livelihood wrong effort in one of wrong effort wrong mindfulness in one of wrong mindfulness wrong concentration arises clear knowing is the leader in the attainment of skillful qualities followed by conscience concern in a knowledgeable person immersed in clear knowing right view arises in one of right view right resolve arises in one of right resolve right speech in one of right speech right action in one of right action right livelihood in one of right livelihood right effort in one of right effort right mindfulness in one of right mindfulness right concentration arises staying at savatthi then the blessed one picking up a little bit of dust with the tip of his fingernail said to the monks what do you think monks which is greater the little bit of dust i have picked up with the tip of my fingernail or the great earth the great earth is far greater lord the little bit of dust the blessed one has picked up with the tip of his fingernail is next to nothing it doesn t even count it s no comparison it s not even a fraction this little bit of dust the blessed one has picked up with the tip of his fingernail when compared with the great earth in the same way monks few are the beings reborn among human beings far more are those reborn elsewhere thus you should train yourselves we will live heedfully that s how you should train yourselves in the village or the forest in the lowlands or the highlands wherever the worthy ones dwell that terrain would be found pleasing so pleasing they find the forests wherein most people are not pleased rid of passion they will be pleased they do not pursue mere pleasure settled at the root of a tree with shaven head clad in a robe the elder foremost in wisdom upatissa just meditates he has become calm and at rest wise in speech and not self centered he s shaken off unwholesome states like wind would leaves from a tree he has become calm and at rest wise in speech and not self centered he has plucked off unwholesome states like wind would leaves from a tree the mighty ocean and the earth a mountain or even the wind are not adequate similes for the teacher s splendid release the elder keeps the wheel rolling possessing great wisdom composed and just like earth water and fire he s neither attached nor opposed thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living near then the venerable maha cundato the venerable maha cunda thus seated the blessed one said o cunda let the factors of enlightenment occur to your mind these seven factors of enlightenment i mindfulness the factor of enlightenment ii investigation of the dhamma the factor of enlightenment iii persevering effort the factor of enlightenment iv rapture the factor of enlightenment v calm the factor of enlightenment vi concentration the factor of enlightenment vii equanimity the factor of enlightenment these seven factors of enlightenment most assuredly cunda they are factors of enlightenment most assuredly cunda they are factors of enlightenment thus said the venerable maha cunda and the master approved of it then the blessed one recovered from his affliction and thus disappeared his affliction listen to the sound of water in the clefts and in the gullies the tiny streams gurgle loudly mighty waters flow in silence i shall show you o monks a way of dhamma presentation by which there are one hundred and eight feelings hence listen to me in one way o monks i have spoken of two kinds of feelings and in other ways of three five six eighteen thirty six and one hundred and eight feelings what are the what are the what are the what are the what are the what are the what are the these o monks are called the hundred and eight feelings and this is the way of the dhamma presentation by which there are one hundred and eight feelings there are these ten things that a person gone forth should reflect on often which ten i have become casteless a person gone forth should often reflect on this my life is dependent on others my behavior should be different from that of householders can i fault myself with regard to my virtue can my knowledgeable fellows in the holy life on close examination fault me with regard to my virtue i will grow different separate from all that is dear appealing to me i am the owner of my actions what am i becoming as the days nights fly past do i delight in an empty dwelling have i attained a superior human attainment a truly noble distinction of knowledge vision such that when my fellows in the holy life question me in the last days of my life i won t feel abashed a person gone forth should often reflect on this these are the ten things that a person gone forth should reflect on often i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in freed dissociated released from ten things bahuna the tathagata dwells with unrestricted awareness which ten freed dissociated released from form the tathagata dwells with unrestricted awareness freed dissociated released from feeling freed dissociated released from perception freed dissociated released from fabrications freed dissociated released from consciousness freed dissociated released from birth freed dissociated released from aging freed dissociated released from death freed dissociated released from stress freed dissociated released from defilement the tathagata dwells with unrestricted awareness monks these five are things that weaken the training which five the taking of life stealing sexual misconduct the telling of lies and distilled fermented beverages that are a cause for heedlessness these five are things that weaken the training to abandon these five things that weaken the training one should develop the four frames of reference which four there is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in of itself ardent alert mindful putting aside greed distress with reference to the world he remains focused on feelings in of themselves mind in of itself mental qualities in of themselves ardent alert mindful putting aside greed distress with reference to the world to abandon the five things that weaken the training one should develop these four frames of reference for a person endowed with virtue consummate in virtue there is no need for an act of will may freedom from remorse arise in me it is in the nature of things that freedom from remorse arises in a person endowed with virtue consummate in virtue for a person free from remorse there is no need for an act of will may joy arise in me it is in the nature of things that joy arises in a person free from remorse for a joyful person there is no need for an act of will may rapture arise in me it is in the nature of things that rapture arises in a joyful person for a rapturous person there is no need for an act of will may my body be serene it is in the nature of things that a rapturous person grows serene in body for a person serene in body there is no need for an act of will may i experience pleasure it is in the nature of things that a person serene in body experiences pleasure for a person experiencing pleasure there is no need for an act of will may my mind grow concentrated it is in the nature of things that the mind of a person experiencing pleasure grows concentrated for a person whose mind is concentrated there is no need for an act of will may i know see things as they actually are it is in the nature of things that a person whose mind is concentrated knows sees things as they actually are for a person who knows sees things as they actually are there is no need for an act of will may i feel disenchantment it is in the nature of things that a person who knows sees things as they actually are feels disenchantment for a person who feels disenchantment there is no need for an act of will may i grow dispassionate it is in the nature of things that a person who feels disenchantment grows dispassionate for a dispassionate person there is no need for an act of will may i realize the knowledge vision of release it is in the nature of things that a dispassionate person realizes the knowledge vision of release in this way dispassion has knowledge vision of release as its purpose knowledge vision of release as its reward disenchantment has dispassion as its purpose dispassion as its reward knowledge vision of things as they actually are has disenchantment as its purpose disenchantment as its reward concentration has knowledge vision of things as they actually are as its purpose knowledge vision of things as they actually are as its reward pleasure has concentration as its purpose concentration as its reward serenity has pleasure as its purpose pleasure as its reward rapture has serenity as its purpose serenity as its reward joy has rapture as its purpose rapture as its reward freedom from remorse has joy as its purpose joy as its reward skillful virtues have freedom from remorse as their purpose freedom from remorse as their reward in this way mental qualities lead on to mental qualities mental qualities bring mental qualities to their consummation for the sake of going from the near to the further shore i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery then ven nanda emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one it s amazing sir it s astounding how short lived the blessed one s mother was seven days after the blessed one s birth she died and reappeared among the contented tusita deva group that s the way it is nanda that s the way it is for the mothers of bodhisattas are short lived seven days after the bodhisattas birth the bodhisattas mothers pass away and reappear among the contented deva group then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed those who have come to be those who will be all will go leaving the body behind the skillful person realizing the loss of all should live the holy life ardently the grain harvested the rice gone to be threshed but i don t get any alms how will i get by confident recollect the immeasurable buddha your body pervaded with rapture you ll be at the height of continual joy confident recollect the immeasurable dhamma your body pervaded with rapture you ll be at the height of continual joy confident recollect the immeasurable sangha your body pervaded with rapture you ll be at the height of continual joy you live in the open air cold are these wintry nights don t suffer overcome with the cold go into your hut with its fastened bolt i ll fasten the four immeasurables with them i ll dwell in comfort i won t suffer from the cold dwelling unperturbed i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said monks there are some brahmans contemplatives who teach in this way who have this view whatever a person experiences pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain all is caused by what was done in the past thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the non doing of new actions there will be no flow into the future with no flow into the future there is the ending of action with the ending of action the ending of stress with the ending of stress the ending of feeling with the ending of feeling all suffering stress will be exhausted such is the teaching of the niganthas going to niganthas who teach in this way i have asked them is it true friend niganthas that you teach in this way that you have this view whatever a person experiences pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain all is caused by what was done in the past thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the non doing of new actions there will be no flow into the future with no flow into the future there is the ending of action with the ending of action the ending of stress with the ending of stress the ending of feeling with the ending of feeling all suffering stress will be exhausted having been asked this by me the niganthas admitted it yes so i said to them but friends do you know that you existed in the past and that you did not not exist no friend and do you know that you did evil actions in the past and that you did not not do them no friend and do you know that you did such and such evil actions in the past no friend and do you know that so and so much stress has been exhausted or that so and so much stress remains to be exhausted or that with the exhaustion of so and so much stress all stress will be exhausted no friend but do you know what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the here now no friend so friends it seems that you don t know that you existed in the past and that you did not not exist you don t know what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the here now that being the case it is not proper for you to assert that whatever a person experiences pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain all is caused by what was done in the past thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the non doing of new actions there will be no flow into the future with no flow into the future there is the ending of action with the ending of action the ending of stress with the ending of stress the ending of feeling with the ending of feeling all suffering stress will be exhausted if however you knew that you existed in the past and that you did not not exist if you knew that you did evil actions in the past and that you did not not do them if you knew that you did such and such evil actions in the past you don t know that so and so much stress has been exhausted or that so and so much stress remains to be exhausted or that with the exhaustion of so and so much stress all stress will be exhausted if you knew what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the here now then that being the case it would be proper for you to assert that whatever a person experiences pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain all is caused by what was done in the past thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the non doing of new actions there will be no flow into the future with no flow into the future there is the ending of action with the ending of action the ending of stress with the ending of stress the ending of feeling with the ending of feeling all suffering stress will be exhausted in the same way friend niganthas if you knew that you existed in the past and that you did not not exist if you knew what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the here now then that being the case it would be proper for you to assert that whatever a person experiences pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain all is caused by what was done in the past thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the non doing of new actions there will be no flow into the future with no flow into the future there is the ending of action with the ending of action the ending of stress with the ending of stress the ending of feeling with the ending of feeling all suffering stress will be exhausted but because you do not know that you existed in the past you do not know what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the here now then that being the case it is not proper for you to assert that whatever a person experiences pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain all is caused by what was done in the past thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the non doing of new actions there will be no flow into the future with no flow into the future there is the ending of action with the ending of action the ending of stress with the ending of stress the ending of feeling with the ending of feeling all suffering stress will be exhausted when this was said the niganthas said to me friend the nigantha nataputta so i asked them further friend niganthas what do you think when there is fierce striving fierce exertion do you feel fierce sharp racking pains from harsh treatment and when there is no fierce striving no fierce exertion do you feel no fierce sharp racking pains from harsh treatment yes friend then it s not proper for you to assert that whatever a person experiences pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain all is caused by what was done in the past thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the non doing of new actions there will be no flow into the future with no flow into the future there is the ending of action with the ending of action the ending of stress with the ending of stress the ending of feeling with the ending of feeling all suffering stress will be exhausted if it were the case that when there was fierce striving fierce exertion you felt fierce sharp racking pains from harsh treatment and when there was no fierce striving no fierce exertion you still felt fierce sharp racking pains from harsh treatment then that being the case it would be proper for you to assert that whatever a person experiences pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain all is caused by what was done in the past thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the non doing of new actions there will be no flow into the future with no flow into the future there is the ending of action with the ending of action the ending of stress with the ending of stress the ending of feeling with the ending of feeling all suffering stress will be exhausted but because when there is fierce striving fierce exertion you feel fierce sharp racking pains from harsh treatment and when there was no fierce striving no fierce exertion you feel no fierce sharp racking pains from harsh treatment then that being the case it is not proper for you to assert that whatever a person experiences pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain all is caused by what was done in the past thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the non doing of new actions there will be no flow into the future with no flow into the future there is the ending of action with the ending of action the ending of stress with the ending of stress the ending of feeling with the ending of feeling all suffering stress will be exhausted but when i said this i did not see that the niganthas had any legitimate defense of their teaching so i asked them further friend niganthas what do you think can an action to be experienced in the here now be turned through striving exertion into an action to be experienced in the future life no friend can an action to be experienced in the future life be turned through striving exertion into an action to be experienced in the here now no friend what do you think can an action to be experienced as pleasure be turned through striving exertion into an action to be experienced as pain no friend can an action to be experienced as pain be turned through striving exertion into an action to be experienced as pleasure no friend what do you think can an action ripe to be experienced be turned through striving exertion into an action not ripe to be experienced no friend can an action not ripe to be experienced be turned through striving exertion into an action ripe to be experienced no friend what do you think can an action greatly to be experienced be turned through striving exertion into an action barely to be experienced no friend can an action barely to be experienced be turned through striving exertion into an action greatly to be experienced no friend what do you think can an action to be experienced be turned through striving exertion into an action not to be experienced no friend can an action not to be experienced be turned through striving exertion into an action to be experienced no friend so friends it seems that an action to be experienced in the here now cannot be turned through striving exertion into an action to be experienced in the future life an action to be experienced in the future life cannot be turned through striving exertion into an action to be experienced in the here now an action to be experienced cannot be turned through striving exertion into an action not to be experienced an action not to be experienced cannot be turned through striving exertion into an action to be experienced that being the case the striving of the niganthas is fruitless their exertion is fruitless such is the teaching of the niganthas and such being the teaching of the niganthas ten legitimate deductions can be drawn that give grounds for censuring them if beings experience pleasure pain based on what was done in the past then obviously the niganthas have done bad things in the past which is why they now feel such fierce sharp racking pains if beings experience pleasure pain based on the creative act of a supreme god then obviously the niganthas have been created by an evil supreme god which is why they now feel such fierce sharp racking pains if beings experience pleasure pain based on sheer luck then obviously the niganthas have evil luck which is why they now feel such fierce sharp racking pains if beings experience pleasure pain based on birth then obviously the niganthas have had an evil birth which is why they now feel such fierce sharp racking pains if beings experience pleasure pain based on efforts in the here now then obviously the niganthas have evil efforts in the here now which is why they now feel such fierce sharp racking pains if beings experience pleasure pain based on what was done in the past the niganthas deserve censure even if not they still deserve censure if beings experience pleasure pain based on the creative act of a supreme god the niganthas deserve censure even if not they still deserve censure if beings experience pleasure pain based on sheer luck the niganthas deserve censure even if not they still deserve censure if beings experience pleasure pain based on birth the niganthas deserve censure even if not they still deserve censure if beings experience pleasure pain based on efforts in the here now the niganthas deserve censure even if not they still deserve censure such is the teaching of the niganthas monks and such being the teaching of the niganthas these ten legitimate deductions can be drawn that give grounds for censuring them this is how striving is fruitless how exertion is fruitless yes lord why is that because he is in love with her his mind ensnared with fierce desire fierce passion now suppose the thought were to occur to him i am in love with this woman my mind ensnared with fierce desire fierce passion when i see her standing with another man chatting joking laughing then sorrow lamentation pain distress despair arise within me why don t i abandon my desire passion for that woman so he abandons his desire passion for that woman and afterwards sees her standing with another man chatting joking laughing what do you think monks as he sees her standing with another man chatting joking laughing would sorrow lamentation pain distress despair arise in him no lord why is that he is dispassionate toward that woman in the same way the monk when not loaded down does not load himself down with pain nor does he reject pleasure that accords with the dhamma although he is not infatuated with that pleasure he discerns that when i exert a physical verbal or mental fabrication against this cause of stress then from the fabrication of exertion there is dispassion when i look on with equanimity at that cause of stress then from the development of equanimity there is dispassion so he exerts a fabrication against the cause of stress where there comes dispassion from the fabrication of exertion and develops equanimity with regard to the cause of stress where there comes dispassion from the development of equanimity thus the stress coming from the cause of stress for which there is dispassion through the fabrication of exertion is exhausted the stress resulting from the cause of stress for which there is dispassion through the development of equanimity is exhausted furthermore the monk notices this when i live according to my pleasure unskillful mental qualities increase in me skillful qualities decline when i exert myself with stress pain though unskillful qualities decline in me skillful qualities increase why don t i exert myself with stress pain so he exerts himself with stress pain and while he is exerting himself with stress pain unskillful qualities decline in him skillful qualities increase then at a later time he would no longer exert himself with stress pain why is that because he has attained the goal for which he was exerting himself with stress pain that is why at a later time he would no longer exert himself with stress pain in the same way the monk notices this when i live according to my pleasure unskillful mental qualities increase in me skillful qualities decline when i exert myself with stress pain though unskillful qualities decline in me skillful qualities increase why don t i exert myself with stress pain so he exerts himself with stress pain and while he is exerting himself with stress pain unskillful qualities decline in him skillful qualities increase then at a later time he would no longer exert himself with stress pain why is that because he has attained the goal for which he was exerting himself with stress pain that is why at a later time he would no longer exert himself with stress pain this is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitful furthermore there is the case where a tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly self awakened he teaches the dhamma admirable in its beginning admirable in its middle admirable in its end he proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure a householder or householder s son hearing the dhamma gains conviction in the tathagata and reflects household life is confining a dusty path life gone forth is the open air it isn t easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shell what if i having shaved off my hair beard and putting on the ochre robe were to go forth from the household life into homelessness so after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of relatives large or small shaves off his hair and beard puts on the ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessness virtue when he has thus gone forth endowed with the monks training livelihood then abandoning the taking of life he abstains from the taking of life he dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beings abandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not given he takes only what is given accepts only what is given lives not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pure this too is part of his virtue abandoning uncelibacy he lives a celibate life aloof refraining from the sexual act that is the villager s way abandoning false speech he abstains from false speech he speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the world abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech what he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people here what he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people there thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concord abandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speech he speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing and pleasing to people at large abandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatter he speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the dhamma and the vinaya he speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goal he abstains from damaging seed and plant life he eats only once a day refraining from the evening meal and from food at the wrong time of day he abstains from dancing singing instrumental music and from watching shows he abstains from wearing garlands and from beautifying himself with scents and cosmetics he abstains from high and luxurious beds and seats he abstains from accepting gold and money he abstains from accepting uncooked grain raw meat women and girls male and female slaves goats and sheep fowl and pigs elephants cattle steeds and mares fields and property he abstains from running messages from buying and selling from dealing with false scales false metals and false measures from bribery deception and fraud he abstains from mutilating executing imprisoning highway robbery plunder and violence he is content with a set of robes to provide for his body and alms food to provide for his hunger just as a bird wherever it goes flies with its wings as its only burden so too is he content with a set of robes to provide for his body and alms food to provide for his hunger wherever he goes he takes only his barest necessities along endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless sense restraint on seeing a form with the eye he does not grasp at any theme or details by which if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him on hearing a sound with the ear on smelling an odor with the nose on tasting a flavor with the tongue on touching a tactile sensation with the body on cognizing an idea with the intellect he does not grasp at any theme or details by which if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him endowed with this noble restraint over the sense faculties he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless mindfulness alertness when going forward and returning he acts with alertness when looking toward and looking away when bending and extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe and his bowl when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and remaining silent he acts with alertness abandoning the hindrances endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue this noble restraint over the sense faculties this noble mindfulness alertness he seeks out a secluded dwelling a wilderness the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a forest grove the open air a heap of straw after his meal returning from his alms round he sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and brings mindfulness to the fore abandoning covetousness with regard to the world he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness he cleanses his mind of covetousness abandoning ill will and anger he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will sympathetic with the welfare of all living beings he cleanses his mind of ill will and anger abandoning sloth and drowsiness he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth and drowsiness mindful alert percipient of light he cleanses his mind of sloth and drowsiness abandoning restlessness and anxiety he dwells undisturbed his mind inwardly stilled he cleanses his mind of restlessness and anxiety abandoning uncertainty he dwells having crossed over uncertainty with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities he cleanses his mind of uncertainty the four jhanas having abandoned these five hindrances imperfections of awareness that weaken discernment then quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters and remains in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluation this too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitful then with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhana rapture and pleasure born of composure one pointedness of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation internal assurance this too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitful then with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding this too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitful then with the abandoning of pleasure and pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain this too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitful the three knowledges with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and re appearance of beings he sees by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human beings passing away and re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma these beings who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell but these beings who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world thus by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human he sees beings passing away and re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma this too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitful with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations he discerns as it has come to be that this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the way leading to the cessation of stress these are mental fermentations this is the origination of fermentations this is the cessation of fermentations this is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations his heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignorance with release there is the knowledge released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world this too is how striving is fruitful how exertion is fruitful such is the teaching of the tathagata and such being the teaching of the tathagata ten legitimate deductions can be drawn that give grounds for praising him if beings experience pleasure pain based on what was done in the past then obviously the tathagata has done good things in the past which is why he now feels such pleasure free from fermentation if beings experience pleasure pain based on the creative act of a supreme god then obviously the tathagata has been created by an excellent supreme god which is why he now feels such pleasure free from fermentation if beings experience pleasure pain based on sheer luck then obviously the tathagata has admirable luck which is why he now feels such pleasure free from fermentation if beings experience pleasure pain based on birth then obviously the tathagata has had an admirable birth which is why he now feels such pleasure free from fermentation if beings experience pleasure pain based on efforts in the here now then obviously the tathagata has admirable efforts in the here now which is why he now feels such pleasure free from fermentation if beings experience pleasure pain based on what was done in the past the tathagata deserves praise even if not he still deserves praise if beings experience pleasure pain based on the creative act of a supreme god tathagata deserves praise even if not he still deserves praise if beings experience pleasure pain based on sheer luck the tathagata deserves praise even if not he still deserves praise if beings experience pleasure pain based on birth tathagata deserves praise even if not he still deserves praise if beings experience pleasure pain based on efforts in the here now the tathagata deserves praise even if not he still deserves praise such is the teaching of the tathagata and such being the teaching of the tathagata these ten legitimate deductions can be drawn that give grounds for praising him that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words suppose there was a mountain cow foolish inexperienced unfamiliar with her pasture unskilled in roaming on rugged mountains and she were to think what if i were to go in a direction i have never gone before to eat grass i have never eaten before to drink water i have never drunk before she would lift her hind hoof without having placed her front hoof firmly and as a result would not get to go in a direction she had never gone before to eat grass she had never eaten before or to drink water she had never drunk before and as for the place where she was standing when the thought occurred to her what if i were to go where i have never been before to drink water i have never drunk before she would not return there safely why is that because she is a foolish inexperienced mountain cow unfamiliar with her pasture unskilled in roaming on rugged mountains in the same way there are cases where a monk foolish inexperienced unfamiliar with his pasture unskilled in being quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities and entering remaining in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation doesn t stick with that theme doesn t develop it pursue it or establish himself firmly in it the thought occurs to him what if i with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations were to enter remain in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance he is not able to enter remain in the second jhana the thought occurs to him what if i were to enter remain in the first jhana he is not able to enter remain in the first jhana this is called a monk who has slipped fallen from both sides like the mountain cow foolish inexperienced unfamiliar with her pasture unskilled in roaming on rugged mountains but suppose there was a mountain cow wise experienced familiar with her pasture skilled in roaming on rugged mountains and she were to think what if i were to go in a direction i have never gone before to eat grass i have never eaten before to drink water i have never drunk before she would lift her hind hoof only after having placed her front hoof firmly and as a result would get to go in a direction she had never gone before to drink water she had never drunk before and as for the place where she was standing when the thought occurred to her what if i were to go in a direction i have never gone before to drink water i have never drunk before she would return there safely why is that because she is a wise experienced mountain cow familiar with her pasture skilled in roaming on rugged mountains in the same way there are some cases where a monk wise experienced familiar with his pasture skilled in being quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities and entering remaining in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation sticks with that theme develops it pursues it establishes himself firmly in it the thought occurs to him what if with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations i were to enter remain in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance without jumping at the second jhana he with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance he sticks with that theme develops it pursues it establishes himself firmly in it the thought occurs to him what if with the fading of rapture i were to enter remain in the third jhana without jumping at the third jhana with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding he sticks with that theme develops it pursues it establishes himself firmly in it the thought occurs to him what if i were to enter remain in the fourth jhana without jumping at the fourth jhana with the abandoning of pleasure stress as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress he enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain he sticks with that theme develops it pursues it establishes himself firmly in it the thought occurs to him what if i were to enter remain in the dimension of the infinitude of space without jumping at the dimension of the infinitude of space he with the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving infinite space enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space he sticks with that theme develops it pursues it establishes himself firmly in it the thought occurs to him what if i were to enter remain in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness without jumping at the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness he with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space perceiving infinite consciousness enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness he sticks with that theme develops it pursues it establishes himself firmly in it the thought occurs to him what if i were to enter remain in the dimension of nothingness without jumping at the dimension of nothingness he with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness perceiving there is nothing enters remains in the dimension of nothingness he sticks with that theme develops it pursues it establishes himself firmly in it the thought occurs to him what if i were to enter remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non perception without jumping at the dimension of neither perception nor non perception he with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness enters remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non perception he sticks with that theme develops it pursues it establishes himself firmly in it the thought occurs to him what if i with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception were to enter remain in the cessation of perception feeling without jumping at the cessation of perception feeling he with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception enters remains in the cessation of perception feeling if he wants he wields manifold supranormal powers having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one he appears he vanishes he goes unimpeded through walls ramparts and mountains as if through space he dives in and out of the earth as if it were water he walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land sitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged bird with his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon so mighty and powerful he exercises influence with his body even as far as the brahma worlds he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants he hears by means of the divine ear element purified and surpassing the human both kinds of sounds divine and human whether near or far he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants he knows the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with his own awareness he discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passion he discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion he discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion he discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind and a scattered mind as a scattered mind he discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mind he discerns an excelled mind one that is not at the most excellent level as an excelled mind and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind he discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind he discerns a released mind as a released mind and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants he recollects his manifold past lives lit previous homes i e one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion recollecting there i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose there there too i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose here thus he remembers his manifold past lives in their modes and details he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants he sees by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human beings passing away and re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma these beings who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell but these beings who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world thus by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human he sees beings passing away and re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants then through the ending of the mental fermentations he remains in the fermentation free awareness release and discernment release having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here and now he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion the blessed one was sitting contemplating his own abandoning of the perceptions categories of objectification then the blessed one realizing his own abandoning of the perceptions categories of objectification on that occasion exclaimed one who has no objectifications when endowed with five qualities monks in no long time a monk penetrates and intuitsat in the same way there is the case where an uninstructed run of the mill person who has no regard for noble ones is not well versed or disciplined in their dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not well versed or disciplined in their dhamma assumes form the body to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form that form tears away from him and so from that cause he would come to disaster he assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or feeling as in the self or the self as in feeling that feeling tears away from him and so from that cause he would come to disaster he assumes perception to be the self or the self as possessing perception or perception as in the self or the self as in perception that perception tears away from him and so from that cause he would come to disaster he assumes mental fabrications to be the self or the self as possessing fabrications or fabrications as in the self or the self as in fabrications those fabrications tear away from him and so from that cause he would come to disaster he assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness that consciousness tears away from him and so from that cause he would come to disaster inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord is feeling constant or inconstant inconstant lord is perception constant or inconstant inconstant lord are fabrications constant or inconstant inconstant lord what do you think monks is consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord thus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am any feeling whatsoever any perception whatsoever any fabrications whatsoever any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am seeing thus the well instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness disenchanted he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is fully released with full release there is the knowledge fully released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world jtb ag calls this sutta iii i follow pts numbering and call it iii on one occasion the blessed one was staying near indeed brahmans you are feeble old men aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life years old and you have done no admirable deeds no skillful deeds no deeds that allay your fears this world is swept away by aging by illness by death with the world thus swept away by aging illness death any restraint of body speech intellect practiced here will be one s shelter cave island refuge after death in the world beyond it s swept along life its next to nothing span for one swept on by aging no shelters exist keeping sight of this danger in death do meritorious deeds that bring bliss whoever here is restrained in body speech awareness who makes merit while he s alive that will be for his bliss after death a monk and how is a monk one with a sense of dhamma there is the case where a monk knows the dhamma dialogues narratives of mixed prose and verse explanations verses spontaneous exclamations quotations birth stories amazing events question answer sessions and how is a monk one with a sense of meaning there is the case where a monk knows the meaning of this that statement this is the meaning of that statement that is the meaning of this if he didn t know the meaning of this that statement this is the meaning of that statement that is the meaning of this he wouldn t be said to be one with a sense of meaning so it s because he does know the meaning of this that statement this is the meaning of that statement that is the meaning of this that he is said to be one with a sense of meaning this is one with a sense of dhamma a sense of meaning and how is a monk one with a sense of himself there is the case where a monk knows himself this is how far i have come in conviction virtue learning liberality discernment quick wittedness if he didn t know himself this is how far i have come in conviction virtue learning liberality discernment quick wittedness he wouldn t be said to be one with a sense of himself so it s because he does know himself this is how far i have come in conviction virtue learning liberality discernment quick wittedness that he is said to be one with a sense of himself this is one with a sense of dhamma a sense of meaning a sense of himself and how is a monk one with a sense of and how is a monk one with a sense of time there is the case where a monk knows the time this is the time for recitation this the time for questioning this the time for making an effort in meditation this the time for seclusion if he didn t know the time this is the time for recitation this the time for questioning this the time for making an effort this the time for seclusion he wouldn t be said to be one with a sense of time so it s because he does know the time this is the time for recitation this the time for questioning this the time for making an effort this the time for seclusion that he is said to be one with a sense of time this is one with a sense of dhamma a sense of meaning a sense of himself a sense of moderation a sense of time and how is a monk one with a and how is a monk one with a sense of distinctions among individuals there is the case where people are known to a monk in terms of two categories of two people one who wants to see noble ones and one who doesn t the one who doesn t want to see noble ones is to be criticized for that reason the one who does want to see noble ones is for that reason to be praised of two people who want to see noble ones one who wants to hear the true dhamma and one who doesn t the one who doesn t want to hear the true dhamma is to be criticized for that reason the one who does want to hear the true dhamma is for that reason to be praised of two people who want to hear the true dhamma one who listens with an attentive ear and one who listens without an attentive ear the one who listens without an attentive ear is to be criticized for that reason the one who listens with an attentive ear is for that reason to be praised of two people who listen with an attentive ear one who having listened to the dhamma remembers it and one who doesn t the one who having listened to the dhamma doesn t remember it is to be criticized for that reason the one who having listened to the dhamma does remember the dhamma is for that reason to be praised of two people who having listened to the dhamma remember it one who explores the meaning of the dhamma he has remembered and one who doesn t the one who doesn t explore the meaning of the dhamma he has remembered is to be criticized for that reason the one who does explore the meaning of the dhamma he has remembered is for that reason to be praised of two people who explore the meaning of the dhamma they have remembered one who practices the dhamma in line with the dhamma having a sense of dhamma having a sense of meaning and one who doesn t the one who doesn t practice the dhamma in line with the dhamma having a sense of dhamma having a sense of meaning is to be criticized for that reason the one who does practice the dhamma in line with the dhamma having a sense of dhamma having a sense of meaning is for that reason to be praised this is how people are known to a monk in terms of two categories and this is how a monk is one with a sense of distinctions among individuals a monk endowed with these seven qualities is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect an unexcelled field of merit for the world thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living near savatthi at jetavana at the monastery of anathapindika then he addressed the monks saying o monks venerable sir said the monks by way of reply to the blessed one thereupon he spoke as follows monks i shall relate a former incident there arose a battle between the devas gods and asuras then sakka the lord of the devas addressed the devas of the tavatimsa heaven thus happy ones if the devas who have gone to the battle should experience fear or terror or suffer from hair standing on end let them behold the crest of my own banner if you do so any fear terror or hair standing on end arising in you will pass away if you fail to look up to the crest of my banner look at the crest of the banner of pajapati king of gods if you do so any fear terror or hair standing on end arising in you will pass away if you fail to look up to the crest of pajapati king of the gods look at the crest of the banner of varuna king of the gods if you do so any fear terror or hair standing on end arising in you will pass away monks any fear terror or hair standing on end arising in them who look at the crest of the banner of sakka the lord of the gods of pajapati of varuna of isana the king of the gods any fear terror or hair standing on end may pass away or may not pass away what is the reason for this sakka the lord of gods o monks is not free from lust not free from hate not free from delusion and is therefore liable to fear terror fright and flight i also say unto you o monks if any fear terror or hair standing on end should arise in you when you have gone to the forest or to the foot of a tree or to an empty house lonely place then think only of me thus such indeed is the blessed one arahant consummate one supremely enlightened endowed with knowledge and virtue welcome being knower of worlds the peerless trainer of persons teacher of gods and men the buddha the blessed one monks if you think of me any fear terror or standing of hair on end that may arise in you will pass away if you fail to think of me then think of the dhamma the doctrine thus well expounded is the dhamma by the blessed one a dhamma to be realized by oneself and gives immediate results a dhamma which invites investigation and leads up to nibbana a dhamma to be understood by the wise each for himself monks if you think of the dhamma any fear terror or hair standing on end that may arise in you will pass away if you fail to think of the dhamma then think of the sangha the order thus of good conduct is the order of disciples of the blessed one of upright conduct is the order of disciples of the blessed one of wise conduct is the order of disciples of the blessed one of dutiful conduct is the order of disciples of the blessed one this order of disciples of the blessed one namely those four pairs of persons so said the blessed one having thus spoken the teacher the welcome being i whether in forest or at foot of tree or in some secluded spot o monks do call to mind that buddha supreme then will there be no fear to you at all ii if you think not of the buddha o monks that lord of the world and chief of men then do think o monks of that dhamma so well preached and leading to nibbana iii if you think not of the dhamma o monks well preached and leading to nibbana then do think o monks of that sangha that wonderful field of merit to all iv to those recalling the buddha supreme to those recalling the dhamma sublime and to those recalling the sangha no fear no terror will make them quiver i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near r jagaha at the bamboo grove the squirrels sanctuary and on that occasion ven s riputta and ven mah moggall na were staying in pigeon cave then on a moonlit night ven s riputta his head newly shaven was sitting in the open air having attained a certain level of concentration and on that occasion two yakkhas who were companions were flying from north to south on some business or other they saw ven s riputta his head newly shaven sitting in the open air seeing him the first yakkha said to the second i m inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the head when this was said the second yakkha said to the first enough of that my good friend don t lay a hand on the contemplative he s an outstanding contemplative of great power great might a second time the first yakkha said to the second i m inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the head a second time the second yakkha said to the first enough of that my good friend don t lay a hand on the contemplative he s an outstanding contemplative of great power great might a third time the first yakkha said to the second i m inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the head a third time the second yakkha said to the first enough of that my good friend don t lay a hand on the contemplative he s an outstanding contemplative of great power great might then the first yakkha ignoring the second yakkha gave ven s riputta a blow on the head and with that blow he might have knocked over an elephant seven or eight cubits tall or split a great rocky crag but right there the yakkha yelling i m burning fell into the great hell now ven moggall na with his divine eye pure and surpassing the human saw the yakkha give ven s riputta a blow on the head seeing this he went to ven s riputta and on arrival said to him i hope you are well friend s riputta i hope you are comfortable i hope you are feeling no pain i am well friend moggall na i am comfortable but i do have a slight headache how amazing friend s riputta how astounding how great your power might just now a yakkha gave you a blow on the head so great was that blow that he might have knocked over an elephant seven or eight cubits tall or split a great rocky crag but all you say is this i am well friend moggall na i am comfortable but i do have a slight headache how amazing friend moggall na how astounding how great your power might where you saw a yakkha just now i didn t even see a dust devil the blessed one with the divine ear property pure and surpassing the human heard those two great beings conversing in this way then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed whose mind standing like rock doesn t shake dispassionate for things that spark passion unprovoked by things that spark provocation when one s mind is developed like this from where can there come to him suffering stress i a monk gone to the charnel ground saw a woman cast away discarded there in the cemetery though some were disgusted seeing her dead evil lust appeared as if i were blind to the oozings in less time than it takes for rice to cook i got out of that place mindful alert i sat down to one side then apt attention arose in me the drawbacks appeared disenchantment stood at an even keel with that my heart was released see the dhamma s true rightness the three knowledges have been attained the awakened one s bidding done i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near ves l at the gabled hall in the great forest then early in the morning he adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl robes went into ves l for alms then having gone for alms in ves l after the meal returning from his alms round he addressed ven nanda get a sitting cloth nanda we will go to the p v la shrine for the day s abiding responding as you say lord to the blessed one ven nanda followed along behind the blessed one carrying the sitting cloth then the blessed one went to the p v la shrine and on arrival sat down on the seat laid out seated the blessed one addressed ven nanda ves l is refreshing nanda refreshing too are the udena shrine the gotamaka shrine the sattamba shrine the manyson shrine the s randa shrine the p v la shrine anyone nanda in whom the four bases of powerbut ven nanda even when the blessed one had given such a blatant sign such a blatant hint wasn t able to understand his meaning he didn t request of him lord may the blessed one remain for an eon may the one well gone remain for an eon for the benefit of the many for the happiness of the many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit happiness of human and divine beings it was as if his mind was possessed by m ra a second time a third time the blessed one addressed ven nanda ves l is refreshing nanda refreshing too are the udena shrine the gotamaka shrine the sattamba shrine the manyson shrine the s randa shrine the p v la shrine anyone nanda in whom the four bases of power are developed pursued given a means of transport

means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated and well undertaken he could if he wanted remain for an eon or the remainder of an eon but ven nanda even when the blessed one had given such a blatant sign such a blatant hint wasn t able to understand his meaning he didn t request of him lord may the blessed one remain for an eon may the one well gone remain for an eon for the benefit of the many for the happiness of the many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit happiness of human and divine beings it was as if his mind was possessed by m ra then the blessed one addressed ven nanda go nanda do what you think it is now time to do responding as you say lord to the blessed one ven nanda got up from his seat bowed down to the blessed one and after circling him to the right went to sit under a tree not far from the blessed one then not long after ven nanda had left m ra the evil one went to the blessed one and on arrival stood to one side as he was standing there he said to the blessed one may the blessed one totally unbind now lord may the one well gone totally unbind now lord now is the time for the blessed one s total unbinding lord after all these words were said by the blessed one evil one i will not totally unbind as long as my monk disciples are not yet experienced trained attained to confidence desiring rest from the yoke learned maintaining the dhamma practicing the dhamma in line with the dhamma practicing masterfully living in line with the dhamma declaring the dhamma after having learned it from their own teachers teaching it describing it setting it forth revealing it explaining it making it plain well refuting in line with the dhamma any opposing teachings that have arisen teaching the dhamma with its marvels but now lord the blessed one s monk disciples are experienced trained attained to confidence desiring rest from the yoke learned maintaining the dhamma practicing the dhamma in line with the dhamma practicing masterfully living in line with the dhamma declaring the dhamma after having learned it from their own teachers teaching it describing it setting it forth revealing it explaining it making it plain

lord now is the time for the blessed one s total unbinding lord after all these words were said by the blessed one evil one i will not totally unbind as long as my nun disciples my male lay follower disciples my female lay follower disciples are not yet experienced trained attained to maturity desiring rest from the yoke learned maintaining the dhamma practicing the dhamma in line with the dhamma practicing masterfully living in line with the dhamma declaring the dhamma after having learned it from their own teachers teaching it describing it setting it forth revealing it explaining it making

unbinding lord after all these words were said by the blessed one evil one i will not totally unbind as long as this holy life of mine is not powerful prosperous widely spread disseminated among many people well expounded as far as there are devas human beings but now lord the blessed one s holy life is powerful prosperous widely spread disseminated among many people well expounded as far as there are devas human beings may the blessed one totally unbind now lord may the one well gone totally unbind now lord now is the time for the blessed one s total unbinding lord when this was said the blessed one said to m ra the most evil one relax evil one it won t be long until the tath gata s total unbinding in three month s time from now the tath gata will totally unbind thus at the p v la shrine mindful alert the blessed one relinquished the fabrications of life then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed comparing the incomparable bhikkhus there are these five ways of removing annoyance by which annoyance can be entirely removed by a bhikkhu when it arises in him what are the five loving kindness can be maintained in being toward a person with whom you are annoyed this is how annoyance with him can be removed compassion can be maintained in being toward a person with whom you are annoyed this too is how annoyance with him can be removed onlooking equanimity can be maintained in being toward a person with whom you are annoyed this too is how annoyance with him can be removed the forgetting and ignoring of a person with whom you are annoyed can be practiced this too is how annoyance with him can be removed ownership of deeds in a person with whom you are annoyed can be concentrated upon thus this good person is owner of his deeds heir to his deeds his deeds are the womb from which he is born his deeds are his kin for whom he is responsible his deeds are his refuge he is heir to his deeds be they good or bad this too is how annoyance with him can be removed these are the five ways of removing annoyance by which annoyance can be entirely removed in a bhikkhu when it arises in him black was my hair the color of bees curled at the tips with age it looked like coarse hemp the truth of the truth speaker s words doesn t change fragrant like a perfumed basket filled with flowers with age it smelled musty like animal fur the truth of the truth speaker s words doesn t change thick lush like a well tended grove made splendid the tips elaborate with comb pin with age it grew thin bare here there the truth of the truth speaker s words doesn t change adorned with gold delicate pins it was splendid ornamented with braids now with age that head has gone bald the truth of the truth speaker s words doesn t change curved as if well drawn by an artist my brows were once splendid with age they droop down in folds the truth of the truth speaker s words doesn t change radiant brilliant like jewels my eyes with age they re no longer splendid the truth of the truth speaker s words doesn t change like a delicate peak my nose was splendid in the prime of my youth with age it s like a long pepper the truth of the truth speaker s words doesn t change like bracelets well fashioned well finished my ears were once splendid with age they droop down in folds the truth of the truth speaker s words doesn t change like plaintain buds in their color my teeth were once splendid with age they re broken yellowed the truth of the truth speaker s words doesn t change like that of a cuckoo in the dense jungle flitting through deep forest thickets sweet was the tone of my voice with age it cracks here there the truth of the truth speaker s words doesn t change smooth like a conch shell well polished my neck was once splendid with age it s broken down bent the truth of the truth speaker s words doesn t change like rounded door bars both of them my arms were once splendid with age they re like dried up patali trees the truth of the truth speaker s words doesn t change adorned with gold delicate rings my hands were once splendid with age they re like onions tubers the truth of the truth speaker s words doesn t change swelling round firm high both my breasts were once splendid in the drought of old age they dangle like empty old water bags the truth of the truth speaker s words doesn t change like a sheet of gold well burnished my body was splendid now it s covered with very fine wrinkles the truth of the truth speaker s words doesn t change smooth in their lines like an elephant s trunk both my thighs were once splendid with age they re like knotted bamboo the truth of the truth speaker s words doesn t change adorned with gold delicate anklets my calves were once splendid with age they re like sesame sticks the truth of the truth speaker s words doesn t change as if they were stuffed with soft cotton both my feet were once splendid with age they re shriveled cracked the truth of the truth speaker s words doesn t change such was this physical heap now a house with its plaster all fallen off the truth of the truth speaker s words doesn t change renouncing the five pleasures of sense that entrance and delight the mind and in faith departing from home become one who makes an end of suffering associate with good friends and choose a remote lodging secluded with little noise be moderate in eating robes alms food remedies and a dwelling do not have craving for these things do not be one who returns to the world practice mindfulness of the body and continually develop dispassion towards it avoid the sign of the beautiful connected with passion by meditating on the foul meditate on the signless in this manner the lord repeatedly exhorted the venerable rahula i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion a large number of monks after the meal on returning from their alms round were sitting gathered together in the assembly hall when this discussion arose friends which of these two kings has greater wealth greater possessions the greater treasury the larger realm the greater stock of riding animals the greater army greater power greater might king seniya bimbis ra of magadha or king pasenadi of kosala and this discussion came to no conclusion then the blessed one emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the assembly hall and on arrival sat down on a seat laid out seated he addressed the monks for what topic are you sitting together here and what was the discussion that came to no conclusion just now lord after the meal on returning from our alms round we were sitting gathered here at the assembly hall when this discussion arose friends which of these two kings has greater wealth greater possessions the greater treasury the larger realm the greater stock of riding animals the greater army greater power greater might king seniya bimbis ra of magadha or king pasenadi of kosala this was the discussion that had come to no conclusion when the blessed one arrived it isn t proper monks that sons of good families on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life should talk on such a topic when you have gathered you have two duties either dhamma talk or noble silence then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed any sensual bliss in the world any heavenly bliss isn t worth one sixteenth sixteenth of the bliss of the ending of craving thus i heard on one occasion the venerable come salha do not be satisfied with hearsay or with tradition or with legendary lore or with what has come down in scriptures or with conjecture or with logical inference or with weighing evidence or with a liking for a view after pondering it or with someone else s ability or with the thought the monk is our teacher when you know in yourself these things are unprofitable liable to censure condemned by the wise being adopted and put into effect they lead to harm and suffering then you should abandon them what do you think is there greed yes venerable sir covetousness is the meaning of that i say through greed a covetous man kills breathing things takes what is not given commits adultery and utters falsehood and he gets another to do likewise will that be long for his harm and suffering yes venerable sir what do you think is there hate yes venerable sir ill will is the meaning of that i say through hate a malevolent man kills breathing things will that be long for his harm and suffering yes venerable sir what do you think is there delusion yes venerable sir ignorance is the meaning of that i say through ignorance a deluded man kills breathing things will that be long for his harm and suffering yes venerable sir what do you think are these things profitable or unprofitable unprofitable venerable sir reprehensible or blameless reprehensible venerable sir condemned or commended by the wise condemned by the wise venerable sir being adopted and put into effect do they lead to harm and suffering or do they not or how does it appear to you in this case being adopted and put into effect venerable sir they lead to harm and suffering so it appears in this case now that was the reason why i told you come salha do not be satisfied with hearsay when you know in yourself these things are unprofitable then you should abandon them come salha do not be satisfied with hearsay or with the thought the monk is our teacher when you know in yourself these things are profitable blameless commended by the wise being adopted and put into effect they lead to welfare and happiness then you should practice them and abide in them what do you think is there non greed yes venerable sir uncovetousness is the meaning of that i say through non greed an uncovetous man does not kill breathing things or take what is not given or commit adultery or utter falsehood and he gets another to do likewise will that be long for his welfare and happiness yes venerable sir what do you think is there non hate yes venerable sir non ill will is the meaning of that i say through non ill will an unmalevolent man does not kill breathing things will that be long for his welfare and happiness yes venerable sir what do you think is there non delusion yes venerable sir true knowledge is the meaning of that i say through non delusion a man with true knowledge does not kill breathing things will that be long for his welfare and happiness yes venerable sir what do you think are these things profitable or unprofitable profitable venerable sir reprehensible or blameless blameless venerable sir condemned or commended by the wise commended by the wise venerable sir being adopted and put into effect do they lead to welfare and happiness or do they not or how does it appear to you in this case being adopted and put into effect venerable sir they lead to welfare and happiness so it appears to us in this case now that was the reason why i told you come salha do not be satisfied with hearsay when you know in yourself these things are profitable then you should practice them and abide in them now a disciple who is ennobled by reaching the noble path who has rid himself in this way of covetousness and ill will and is undeluded abides with his heart imbued with loving kindness extending over one quarter likewise the second quarter likewise the third quarter likewise the fourth quarter and so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides with his heart abundant exalted measureless in loving kindness without hostility or ill will extending over the all encompassing world he abides with his heart imbued with compassion gladness equanimity extending over the all encompassing world now he understands this state of contemplation in this way there is this state of divine abiding in he who has entered the stream there is what has been abandoned which is the amount of greed hate and delusion exhausted by the stream entry path there is a superior goal which is arahantship and there is an ultimate escape from this whole field of perception when he knows and sees in this way his heart is liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of being and from the taint of ignorance when liberated by reaching the arahant path there comes thereafter the knowledge that it is liberated he knows that birth is ended that the divine life has been lived out that what had to be done is done and that there is no more of this to come he understands thus formerly there was greed which was bad and now there is none which is good formerly there was hate which was bad and now there is none which is good formerly there was delusion which was bad and now there is none which is good so here and now in this very life he is parched no more by the fever of craving s thirst his fires of greed hate and delusion are extinguished and cooled out experiencing bliss he abides for the remainder of his last life span divinely pure in himself at one time the blessed one was staying at kosambii in si msapaa grove lord the blessed one is holding only a few leaves those up in the trees are far more numerous in the same way monks there are many more things that i have found out but not revealed to you because monks it is not related to the goal it is not fundamental to the holy life does not conduce to disenchantment dispassion cessation tranquillity higher knowledge enlightenment or nibbaana that is why i have not revealed it and what monks have i revealed what i have revealed is this is suffering this is the arising of suffering this is the cessation of suffering and this is the path that leads to the cessation of suffering and why monks have i revealed it because this is related to the goal fundamental to the holy life conduces to disenchantment dispassion cessation tranquillity higher knowledge enlightenment and nibbaana therefore i have revealed it therefore monks your task is to learn this is suffering this is the arising of suffering this is the cessation of suffering this is the path that leads to the cessation of suffering that is your task monks there are these five faculties which five the pleasure faculty the pain faculty the happiness faculty the distress faculty the equanimity faculty and what is the pleasure faculty any physical pleasure physical comfort born of body contact to be experienced as pleasure comfort that is called the pleasure faculty and what is the pain faculty any physical pain physical discomfort born of body contact to be experienced as pain discomfort that is called the pain faculty and what is the happiness faculty any mental pleasure mental comfort born of intellect contact to be experienced as pleasure comfort that is called the happiness faculty and what is the distress faculty any mental pain mental discomfort born of intellect contact to be experienced as pain discomfort that is called the distress faculty and what is the equanimity faculty anything physical or mental to be experienced as neither comfort nor discomfort that is called the equanimity faculty with regard to this the pleasure faculty happiness faculty are to be seen as a feeling of pleasure the pain faculty distress faculty are to be seen as a feeling of pain the equanimity faculty is to be seen as a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain thus by this exposition the five are three and the three five it s in dependence on a pair that consciousness comes into play and how does consciousness come into play in dependence on a pair in dependence on the eye forms there arises eye consciousness the eye is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise forms are inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise thus this pair is both wavering fluctuating inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise eye consciousness is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise whatever is the cause the requisite condition for the arising of eye consciousness that is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise having arisen in dependence on an inconstant factor how could eye consciousness be constant the coming together the meeting the convergence of these three phenomena is eye contact whatever is the cause the requisite condition for the arising of eye contact that is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise having arisen in dependence on an inconstant factor how could eye contact be constant contacted one feels contacted one intends contacted one perceives these phenomena are both wavering fluctuating inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise this is how it s in dependence on a pair that eye consciousness comes into play in dependence on the ear sounds there arises ear consciousness in dependence on the nose aromas there arises nose consciousness in dependence on the tongue flavors there arises tongue consciousness in dependence on the body tactile sensations there arises body consciousness in dependence on the intellect ideas there arises intellect consciousness the intellect is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise ideas are inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise thus this pair is both wavering fluctuating inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise intellect consciousness is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise whatever is the cause the requisite condition for the arising of intellect consciousness that is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise having arisen in dependence on an inconstant factor how could intellect consciousness be constant the coming together the meeting the convergence of these three phenomena is intellect contact whatever is the cause the requisite condition for the arising of intellect contact that is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise having arisen in dependence on an inconstant factor how could intellect contact be constant contacted one feels contacted one intends contacted one perceives these phenomena are both wavering fluctuating inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise this is how it s in dependence on a pair that intellect consciousness comes into play i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at uruvel on the bank of the nera jar river at the root of the bodhi tree the tree of awakening newly awakened and on that occasion he sat at the root of the bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of release then with the passing of seven days after emerging from that concentration in the first watch of the night he gave close attention to dependent co arising in forward order when this is that is in other words from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed as phenomena grow clear to the brahman ardent in jh na his doubts all vanish when he discerns a phenomenon with its cause i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion ven s riputta was sitting not far from the blessed one his legs crossed his body held erect having set mindfulness to the fore the blessed one saw ven s riputta sitting not far away his legs crossed his body held erect having set mindfulness to the fore then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed as a mountain of rock is unwavering well settled so a monk whose delusion is ended doesn t quiver just like a mountain as subha the nun was going through what wrong have i done you that you stand in my way it s not proper my friend that a man should touch a woman gone forth i respect the master s message the training pointed out by the one well gone i am pure without blemish why do you stand in my way you your mind agitated i unagitated you impassioned i unimpassioned unblemished with a mind everywhere released why do you stand in my way you are young not bad looking what need do you have for going forth throw off your ochre robe come let s delight in the flowering forest a sweetness they exude from all around the towering trees with their pollen the beginning of spring is a pleasant season come let s delight in the flowering forest the trees with their blossoming tips moan as it were in the breeze what delight will you have if you plunge into the forest alone frequented by herds of wild beasts disturbed by elephants rutting aroused you want to go unaccompanied into the great lonely frightening forest like a doll made of gold you will go about like a goddess in the gardens of heaven with delicate smooth kasimount sinerulike emberslike a bowl of poisonwell painted puppetslike a murallike an evaporatedlike a tree of goldlike a magic show thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living at then the wanderer i heard and learned this friend samiddhi from the monk gotama s lips bodily kammas are vain verbal kammas are vain only mental kammas are true but there is actually that attainment having entered upon which nothing of result of kammas is felt at all not so friend potaliputta do not say thus do not misrepresent the blessed one it is not good to misrepresent the blessed one the blessed one would not say so bodily kammas are vain verbal kammas are vain only mental kammas are true and there is actually that attainment having entered upon which nothing of result of kammas is felt at all how long is it since you went forth friend samiddhi not long friend three years there now what shall we say to the elder bhikkhus when the young bhikkhu fancies the master is to be defended thus after doing intentional kamma friend samiddhi by way of body speech or mind what does one feel of its result after doing an intentional kamma friend potaliputta by way of body speech or mind one feels suffering as its result then neither agreeing nor disagreeing with the words of the venerable samiddhi the wanderer potaliputta got up from his seat and went away soon after the wanderer potaliputta had gone the venerable samiddhi went to the when this was said the venerable ananda told him friend samiddhi this conversation should be told to the blessed one come let us go to the blessed one and having done so let us tell him about this as he answers so we shall bear it in mind even so friend the venerable samiddhi replied then they went together to the blessed one and after paying homage to him they sat down at one side when they had done so the venerable ananda told the blessed one all the venerable samiddhi s conversation with the wanderer potaliputta when this was said the blessed one told the venerable ananda i do not even know the wanderer by sight ananda how could there have been such a conversation the wanderer potaliputta s question ought to have been answered after analyzing it but this misguided man samiddhi answered it without qualification when this was said the then the blessed one addressed the venerable ananda see ananda how this misguided man udayin interferes i knew ananda that this misguided man udayin would unreasonably interfere now to begin with it was the three kinds of feeling that were asked about by the wanderer potaliputta if when this misguided man samiddhi was asked he had answered the wanderer potaliputta thus after doing an intentional kamma by way of body speech and mind whose result is to be felt as pleasure he feels pleasure after doing an intentional kamma by way of body speech and mind whose result is to be felt as pain he feels pain after doing an intentional kamma by way of body speech and mind whose result is to be felt as neither pain nor pleasure he feels neither pain nor pleasure by answering him thus ananda the misguided man samiddhi would have given the wanderer potaliputta the right answer besides ananda who are the foolish thoughtless wanderers of other sects that they will understand the tathagata s great exposition of kamma but if you ananda would listen to the tathagata expounding the great exposition of kamma you might understand it this is the time blessed one this is the time sublime one for the blessed one to expound the great exposition of kamma having heard it from the blessed one the bhikkhus will bear it in mind then listen ananda and heed well what i shall say even so venerable sir the venerable ananda replied the blessed one said this ananda there are four kinds of persons existing in the world what four i ii but here some person kills living beings and has wrong view on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination in the heavenly world iii iv but here some person abstains from killing living beings and has right view on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell i here ananda in consequence of ardor endeavor devotion diligence and right attention some monk or brahman attains such concentration of mind that when his mind is concentrated he sees with the heavenly eyesight which is purified and surpasses the human that some person kills living beings here takes what is not given misconducts himself in sexual desires speaks falsehood speaks maliciously speaks harshly gossips is covetous is ill willed has wrong view he sees that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell he says it seems that there are evil kammas and that there is the result of misconduct for i have seen that a person killed living beings here had wrong view i have seen that on the dissolution of the body after death he had reappeared in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell he says it seems that one who kills living beings has wrong view will always on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell those who know thus know rightly those who know otherwise are mistaken in their knowledge so he obstinately misapprehends what he himself has known seen and felt insisting on that alone he says only this is true anything else is wrong ii but here in consequence of ardor endeavor devotion diligence and right attention some monk or brahman attains such concentration of mind that when his mind is concentrated he sees with the heavenly eyesight which is purified and surpasses the human that some person kills living beings here has wrong view he sees that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world he says it seems there are no evil kammas there is no result of misconduct for i have seen that a person killed living beings here had wrong view i have seen that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world he says it seems that one who kills living beings has wrong view will always on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world those who know thus know rightly those who know otherwise are mistaken in their knowledge so he obstinately misapprehends what he himself has known seen and felt insisting on that alone he says only this is true anything else is wrong iii here in consequence of ardor endeavor devotion diligence and right attention some monk or brahman attains such concentration of mind that when his mind is concentrated he sees with the heavenly eyesight which is purified and surpasses the human that some person abstains from killing living beings here has right view he sees that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world he says it seems that there are good kammas there is result of good conduct for i have seen that a person abstained from killing living beings here had right view i saw that on the dissolution of the body after death he had reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world he says it seems that one who abstains from killing living beings has right view will always on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world those who know thus know rightly those who know otherwise are mistaken in their knowledge so he obstinately misapprehends what he himself has known seen and felt insisting on that alone he says only this is true anything else is wrong iv but here in consequence of ardor endeavor devotion diligence and right attention some monk or brahman attains such concentration of mind that when his mind is concentrated he sees with the heavenly eyesight which is purified and surpasses the human that some person abstains from killing living beings here has right view he sees that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell he says it seems that there are no good kammas there is no result of good conduct for i have seen that a person abstained from killing here had right view i saw that on the dissolution of the body after death he had reappeared in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell he says it seems that one who abstains from killing living beings has right view will always on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell those who know thus know rightly those who know otherwise are mistaken in their knowledge so he obstinately misapprehends what he himself has known seen and felt insisting on that alone he says only this is true anything else is wrong i now ananda when a monk or brahman says thus it seems that there are evil kammas there is the result of misconduct i concede that to him when he says thus for i have seen that some person killed living beings had wrong view i saw that on the dissolution of the body after death he had reappeared in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell i concede that to him when he says thus it seems that one who kills living beings has wrong view will always on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell i do not concede that to him when he says thus those who know thus know rightly those who know otherwise are mistaken in their knowledge i do not concede that to him when he obstinately misapprehends what he himself has known seen and felt and insisting on that alone he says only this is true anything else is wrong i do not concede that to him why is that the tathagata s knowledge of the great exposition of kamma is different ii now when a monk or brahman says thus it seems that there are no evil kammas there is no result of misconduct i do not concede that to him when he says thus for i have seen that a person killed living beings had wrong view i saw that on the dissolution of the body after death he had reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world i concede that to him when he says thus it seems that one who kills living beings has wrong view will always on the

there is a result of good conduct i concede that to him when he says thus for i have seen that a person abstained from killing living beings here had right view i saw that on the dissolution of the

that to him why is that the tathagata s knowledge of the great exposition of kamma is different iv now when a monk or brahman says thus it seems that there are no good kammas there is no result of good conduct i do not concede that to him when he says thus for i have seen that a person abstained from killing living beings here had right view i saw that on the dissolution of the body after death

alone he says only this is true anything else is wrong i do not concede that to him why is that the tathagata s knowledge of the great exposition of kamma is different the great exposition of kamma i now ananda there is the person who has killed living beings here has had wrong view and on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell ii now there is the person who has killed living beings here has had wrong view and on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination in the heavenly world iii now there is the person who has abstained from killing living beings here has had right view and on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination in the heavenly world iv now there is the person who has abstained from killing living beings here has had right view and on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell so ananda there is kamma that is incapable of good result and appears incapable of good result there is kamma that is incapable of good result and appears capable of good result there is kamma that is capable of good result and appears capable of good result there is kamma that is capable of good result and appears incapable of good result this is what the blessed one said the venerable ananda was satisfied and he rejoiced in the blessed one s words dwelling at thus you should train yourselves we will put aside any gains offerings fame that have arisen and we will not let any gains offerings fame that have arisen keep our minds consumed that s how you should train yourselves i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at uruvel on the bank of the nera jar river at the root of the bodhi tree the tree of awakening newly awakened and on that occasion he sat at the root of the bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of release then with the passing of seven days after emerging from that concentration he surveyed the world with the eye of an awakened one as he did so he saw living beings burning with the many fevers and aflame with the many fires born of passion aversion delusion then on realizing the significance of that he on that occasion exclaimed this world is burning afflicted by contact it calls disease a self by whatever means it construes anything it becomes otherwise than that whatever contemplatives or brahmans say that liberation from becoming is by means of becoming all of them are not released from becoming i say and whatever contemplatives or brahmans say that escape from becoming is by means of non becoming all of them have not escaped from becoming i say for this stress comes into play in dependence on every acquisition see also monks there are these four bonanzas of merit bonanzas of skillfulness nourishments of bliss which four there is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the awakened one indeed the blessed one is worthy and rightly self awakened consummate in knowledge conduct well gone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the teacher of divine human beings awakened blessed this is the first bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss furthermore the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the dhamma the dhamma is well expounded by the blessed one to be seen here now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselves this is the second bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss furthermore the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the sangha the sangha of the blessed one s disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straight forwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully in other words the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types they are the sangha of the blessed one s disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the incomparable field of merit for the world this is the third bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss furthermore the disciple of the noble ones lives at home with an awareness cleansed of the stain of stinginess freely generous openhanded delighting in being magnanimous responsive to requests delighting in the distribution of alms this is the fourth bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss these are four bonanzas of merit bonanzas of skillfulness nourishments of bliss at savatthi monks there are these four establishings of mindfulness which four there is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in of itself ardent alert mindful subduing greed distress with reference to the world for him remaining focused on the body in and of itself any desire for the body is abandoned from the abandoning of desire the deathless is realized he remains focused on feelings in of themselves ardent alert mindful subduing greed distress with reference to the world for him remaining focused on feelings in of themselves any desire for feelings is abandoned from the abandoning of desire the deathless is realized he remains focused on the mind in of itself ardent alert mindful subduing greed distress with reference to the world for him remaining focused on the mind in and of itself any desire for the mind is abandoned from the abandoning of desire the deathless is realized he remains focused on mental qualities in of themselves ardent alert mindful subduing greed distress with reference to the world for him remaining focused on mental qualities in of themselves any desire for mental qualities is abandoned from the abandoning of desire the deathless is realized i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in then the blessed one emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the meeting hall and on arrival sat down on a seat made ready as he was sitting there he addressed the monks for what topic of conversation are you gathered together here in the midst of what topic of conversation have you been interrupted just now lord after the meal on returning from our alms round we gathered at the meeting hall and got engaged in many kinds of bestial topics of conversation conversation about kings robbers ministers of state armies alarms battles food drink clothing furniture garlands scents relatives vehicles villages towns cities the countryside women heroes the gossip of the street the well tales of the dead tales of diversity the creation of the world of the sea talk of whether things exist or not it isn t right monks that sons of good families on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life should get engaged in such topics of conversation i e conversation about kings robbers ministers of state talk of whether things exist or not monks there is the case where a monk himself is modest and instigates talk on modesty among the monks the fact that he is modest and instigates talk on modesty among the monks is grounds for praise he himself is contented and instigates talk on contentment among the monks he himself is secluded and instigates talk on seclusion among the monks he himself is non entangled and instigates talk on non entanglement among the monks he himself has his persistence aroused and instigates talk on arousing persistence among the monks he himself is consummate in virtue and instigates talk on being consummate in virtue among the monks he himself is consummate in concentration and instigates talk on being consummate in concentration among the monks he himself is consummate in discernment and instigates talk on being consummate in discernment among the monks he himself is consummate in release and instigates talk on being consummate in release among the monks he himself is consummate in knowledge vision of release and instigates talk on being consummate in knowledge vision of release among the monks the fact that he is consummate in knowledge vision of release and instigates talk on being consummate in knowledge vision of release among the monks is grounds for praise these are the ten grounds for praise listen kinsmen all of you as many as are assembled here i will teach you the dhamma painful is birth again again rouse yourselves go forth apply yourselves to the awakened one s bidding scatter the army of death as an elephant would a shed made of reeds he who in this doctrine discipline remains heedful abandoning birth the wandering on will put an end to suffering stress in have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near monks there is the case where a certain son of good family out of conviction goes forth from the home life into homelessness thinking i am beset by birth by aging death by sorrows lamentations pains distresses despairs beset by stress overcome with stress perhaps the end of this entire mass of stress might be discerned having thus gone forth he encounters gain offerings fame he is gratified with that gain offerings fame his resolve fulfilled because of that gain offerings fame he exalts himself and disparages others i am a person with gain offerings fame but these other monks are unknown of little influence he is intoxicated with that gain offerings fame heedless about it and falls into heedlessness being heedless he dwells in suffering stress just as if a man in need of heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood passing over the heartwood of a great standing tree possessed of heartwood passing over the sapwood passing over the inner bark passing over the outer bark cutting away the twigs leaves were to go off carrying them thinking heartwood a man with good eyesight seeing him would say ah how this good man didn t know heartwood didn t know sapwood didn t know inner bark didn t know outer bark didn t know twigs leaves that s why he in need of heartwood

resolve not fulfilled he is not intoxicated with that gain offerings fame not heedless about it and does not fall into heedlessness being heedful he achieves consummation in virtue he is gratified with that consummation in virtue but his resolve is not fulfilled because of that consummation in virtue he does not exalt himself or disparage others he is not intoxicated with that consummation in virtue not heedless about it and does not fall into heedlessness being heedful he achieves consummation in concentration he is gratified with that consummation in concentration but his resolve is not fulfilled he is not intoxicated with that consummation in concentration not heedless about it and does not fall into heedlessness being heedful he achieves knowledge vision he is gratified with that knowledge vision but his resolve is not fulfilled because of that knowledge vision he does not exalt himself or disparage others he is not intoxicated with that knowledge vision not heedless about it and does not fall into heedlessness being heedful he achieves a non occasional liberation and it is impossible monks there is no opportunity for that monk to fall from that non occasional release just as if a man in need of heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood cutting away just the heartwood of a great standing tree possessed of heartwood were to go off carrying it knowing heartwood a man with good eyesight seeing him would say ah how this good man in the same way monks there is the case where a certain son of good family out of conviction goes forth from the home life into homelessness thinking i am beset by birth by aging death by sorrows lamentations pains distresses despairs beset by stress overcome with stress perhaps the end of this entire mass of stress might be discerned having thus gone forth he encounters gain offerings fame he is not gratified with that gain offerings fame his resolve not fulfilled he is not intoxicated with that gain offerings fame not heedless about it and does not fall into heedlessness being heedful he achieves consummation in virtue he is gratified with that consummation in virtue but his resolve is not fulfilled because of that consummation in virtue he does not exalt himself or disparage others he is not intoxicated with that consummation in virtue not heedless about it and does not fall into heedlessness being heedful he achieves consummation in concentration he is gratified with that consummation in concentration but his resolve is not fulfilled because of that consummation in concentration he does not exalt himself or disparage others he is not intoxicated with that consummation in concentration not heedless about it and does not fall into heedlessness being heedful he achieves knowledge vision he is gratified with that knowledge vision but his resolve is not fulfilled because of that knowledge vision he does not exalt himself or disparage others he is not intoxicated with that knowledge vision not heedless about it and does not fall into heedlessness being heedful he achieves a non occasional liberation and it is impossible monks there is no opportunity for that monk to fall from that non occasional release monks this holy life doesn t have as its reward gain offerings fame doesn t have as its reward consummation of virtue doesn t have as its reward consummation of concentration doesn t have as its reward knowledge vision but the unprovoked that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words monks when one quality is established in a monk the five faculties are developed developed well which one quality heedfulness and what is heedfulness there is the case where a monk guards his mind with regard to mental fermentations and mental qualities accompanied by fermentations when his mind is guarded with regard to fermentations and mental qualities accompanied by fermentations the faculty of conviction goes to the culmination of its development the faculty of persistence mindfulness concentration discernment goes to the culmination of its development this is how when one quality is established in a monk the five faculties are developed developed well then vacchagotta the wanderer went to the blessed one and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one master gotama a few days ago a large number of contemplatives brahmans and wanderers of various sects were sitting together in the debating hall when this conversation arose among them this this this contemplative gotama the leader of a community the leader of a group the teacher of a group honored and famous esteemed as holy by the mass of people describes a disciple who has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth that one is reborn there that one is reborn there but when the disciple is an ultimate person a foremost person attained to the foremost attainment gotama the contemplative does not describe him when he has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth that one is reborn there that one is reborn there instead he describes him thus he has cut through craving severed the fetter and by rightly breaking through conceit has made an end of suffering stress so i was simply befuddled i was uncertain how is the teaching of gotama the contemplative to be understood of course you are befuddled vaccha of course you are uncertain when there is a reason for befuddlement in you uncertainty arises i designate the rebirth of one who has sustenance vaccha and not of one without sustenance but master gotama at the moment a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance what do you designate as its sustenance then vaccha when a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance i designate it as wind sustained for the wind is its sustenance at that time and at the moment when a being sets this body aside and is not yet reborn in another body what do you designate as its sustenance then vaccha when a being sets this body aside and is not yet reborn in another body i designate it as craving sustained for craving is its sustenance at that time well now good gotama is suffering caused by oneself no indeed kassapa said the blessed one well then good gotama is one s suffering caused by another no indeed kassapa well then good gotama is suffering caused by both oneself and another no indeed kassapa well then good gotama this suffering which is caused neither by oneself nor by another is it the result of chance no indeed kassapa well then good gotama is suffering non existent no kassapa suffering is not non existent suffering exists then the good gotama neither knows nor sees suffering no kassapa it is not that i neither know nor see suffering i know suffering i see suffering well now good gotama when i asked you is suffering caused by oneself you answered no indeed he who performs the act also experiences the result what you kassapa first called suffering caused by oneself this amounts to the eternalist thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living near savatthi at jetavana at anathapindika s monastery at that time at savatthi a certain monk had died bitten by a snake thereupon many monks approached the buddha and having saluted him sat beside him so seated those monks spoke thus to the blessed one bhante venerable sir a certain monk at savatthi had died bitten by a snake assuredly monks said the buddha that monk has not suffused with thoughts of loving kindness metta the four royal tribes of snakes had he done so that monk would not have died of snake bite what are the four royal tribes of snakes the royal tribe of snakes called virupakkha erapatha chabyaputta and kanhagotamaka monks that monk did not suffuse with thoughts of loving kindness these four royal tribes of snakes had not done so he would not have died of snake bite monks i enjoin you to suffuse with thoughts of loving kindness these four royal tribes of snakes for your safety for your preservation and for your protection so said the blessed one having thus spoken the buddha the welcome one may i have metta toward virupakkhas toward erapathas may i have metta may my metta be toward chabyaputtas toward kanha gotamakas also metta may i have may i have metta toward the footless and toward bipeds too my metta may i have may i have metta toward the quadrupeds and toward the many footed also metta may i have let not the footless do me harm nor those that have two feet let not quadrupeds do me harm nor those endowed with many feet all beings all living creatures may good fortune befall them all may not the least harm on them befall infinite in virtue is the buddha infinite is the dhamma infinite is the sangha finite are creeping creatures snakes scorpions centipedes spiders lizards and rats i have guarded myself i have made my protection depart from me ye beings i bow down to the blessed one and to the seven supreme buddhas i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the sakyans at the blessed one acquiesced with silence sensing his acquiescence the kapilavatthu sakyans got up from their seats bowed down to him circumambulated him and then went to the new reception hall on arrival they spread it all over with felt rugs arranged seats set out a water vessel and raised an oil lamp then they went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down stood to one side as they were standing there they said to him lord the reception hall has been covered all over with felt rugs seats have been arranged a water vessel has been set out and an oil lamp raised it is now time for the blessed one to do as he sees fit so the blessed one putting on his robe and taking up his bowl outer robe went together with a community of monks to the reception hall on arrival he washed his feet entered the hall and sat with his back to the central post facing east the community of monks washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the western wall facing east ranged around the blessed one the kapilavatthu sakyans washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the eastern wall facing west ranged around the blessed one then the blessed one having spent most of the night instructing urging rousing encouraging the kapilavatthu sakyans with a dhamma talk dismissed them saying the night is far past gotamas do what you now think it is time to do responding as you say lord the kapilavatthu sakyans rose from their seats bowed down to the blessed one and circumambulating him keeping him to their right departed ven maha moggallana responded as you say lord then the blessed one having arranged his outer robe folded in four lay down on his right side in the lion s sleeping posture with one foot on top of the other mindful alert having made a mental note to get up then ven maha moggallana addressed the monks friend monks yes friend the monks responded ven maha moggallana said friends i will teach you a discourse on being soggy and a discourse on not being soggy as you say friend the monks replied ven maha moggallana said and how is one soggy there is the case where a monk when seeing a form via the eye is in the case of pleasing forms committed to forms and in the case of displeasing forms afflicted by forms he remains with body mindfulness not present and with limited awareness and he does not discern as it actually is present the awareness release discernment release where those evil unskillful qualities that have arisen cease without trace when hearing a sound via the ear when smelling an aroma via the nose when tasting a flavor via the tongue when touching a tactile sensation via the body when cognizing an idea via the intellect he is in the case of pleasing ideas committed to ideas and in the case of displeasing ideas afflicted by ideas he remains with body mindfulness not present and with limited awareness and he does not discern as it actually is present the awareness release discernment release where those evil unskillful qualities that have arisen cease without trace this is called a monk who is soggy with forms cognizable via the eye soggy with sounds cognizable via the ear soggy with aromas cognizable via the nose soggy with flavors cognizable via the tongue soggy with tactile sensations cognizable via the body soggy with ideas cognizable via the intellect and when a monk dwells in this way forms overpower him he does not overpower forms sounds overpower him aromas flavors tactile sensations ideas overpower him he does not overpower ideas this is called a monk overpowered by forms overpowered by sounds overpowered by aromas overpowered by flavors overpowered by tactile sensations overpowered by ideas one overpowered who does not overpower he is overpowered by evil unskillful qualities that defile that lead to further becoming that are miserable that result in suffering stress that tend toward future birth aging death it s in this way friends that one is soggy and how is one not soggy there is the case where a monk when seeing a form via the eye is not in the case of pleasing forms committed to forms nor in the case of displeasing forms afflicted by forms he remains with body mindfulness present and with immeasurable awareness and he discerns as it actually is present the awareness release discernment release where those evil unskillful qualities that have arisen cease without trace when hearing a sound via the ear when smelling an aroma via the nose when tasting a flavor via the tongue when touching a tactile sensation via the body when cognizing an idea via the intellect he is not in the case of pleasing ideas committed to ideas nor in the case of displeasing ideas afflicted by ideas he remains with body mindfulness present and with immeasurable awareness and he discerns as it actually is present the awareness release discernment release where those evil unskillful qualities that have arisen cease without trace this is called a monk who is not soggy with forms cognizable via the eye not soggy with sounds cognizable via the ear not soggy with aromas cognizable via the nose not soggy with flavors cognizable via the tongue not soggy with tactile sensations cognizable via the body not soggy with ideas cognizable via the intellect when a monk dwells in this way then if mara comes to him via the eye mara gains no entry mara gains no foothold if mara comes to him via the ear nose tongue body intellect mara gains no entry mara gains no foothold and when a monk dwells in this way he overpowers forms forms do not overpower him he overpowers sounds aromas flavors tactile sensations ideas ideas do not overpower him this is called a monk who overpowers forms overpowers sounds overpowers aromas overpowers flavors overpowers tactile sensations overpowers ideas one who overpowers and is not overpowered he overpowers evil unskillful qualities that defile that lead to further becoming that are miserable that result in suffering stress that tend toward future birth aging death it s in this way friends that one is not soggy then the blessed one got up and said to ven maha moggallana good good moggallana what you have said to the monks about the discourse on being soggy and the discourse on not being soggy is good that is what ven maha moggallana said and the teacher approved gratified the monks delighted in ven maha moggallana s words i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at the eastern monastery the palace of mig ra s mother and on that occasion a dear and beloved grandson of vis kh mig ra s mother had died so vis kh mig ra s mother her clothes wet her hair wet went to the blessed one in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as she was sitting there the blessed one said to her why have you come here vis kh your clothes wet your hair wet in the middle of the day when this was said she said to the blessed one my dear and beloved grandson has died this is why i have come here my clothes wet my hair wet in the middle of the day vis kh would you like to have as many children grandchildren as there are people in s vatth yes lord i would like to have as many children grandchildren as there are people in s vatth but how many people in s vatth die in the course of a day sometimes ten people die in s vatth in the course of a day sometimes nine eight seven six five four three two sometimes one person dies in s vatth in the course of a day s vatth is never free from people dying so what do you think vis kh would you ever be free of wet clothes wet hair no lord enough of my having so many children grandchildren vis kh those who have a hundred dear ones have a hundred sufferings those who have ninety dear ones have ninety sufferings those who have eighty seventy sixty fifty forty thirty twenty ten nine eight seven six five four three two those who have one dear one have one suffering those who have no dear ones have no sufferings they are free from sorrow free from stain free from lamentation i tell you then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed the sorrows lamentations the many kinds of suffering in the world exist dependent on something dear they don t exist when there s nothing dear and thus blissful sorrowless are those for whom nothing in the world is anywhere dear so one who aspires to the stainless sorrowless shouldn t make anything dear in the world anywhere see also i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion ven s riputta was sitting not far from the blessed one his legs crossed his body held erect reflecting on the peace within himself the blessed one saw ven s riputta sitting not far away his legs crossed his body held erect reflecting on the peace within himself then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed for the monk whose mind is peaceful at peace whose cord is cut once monks there was a teacher named araka a sectarian leader who was free of passion for sensual pleasures he had many hundreds of students and he taught them the dhamma in this way next to nothing brahmans is the life of human beings limited trifling of much stress many despairs one should touch this truth like a sage do what is skillful follow the holy life for one who is born there is no freedom from death now at that time monks the human life span was years with girls marriageable at and at that time there were only six afflictions cold heat hunger thirst defecation urination yet even though people were so long lived long lasting with so few afflictions that teacher araka taught the dhamma to his disciples in this way next to nothing brahmans is the life of human beings limited trifling of much stress many despairs one should touch this truth like a sage do what is skillful follow the holy life for one who is born there is no freedom from death at present monks one speaking rightly would say next to nothing is the life of human beings limited trifling of much stress many despairs one should touch this truth like a sage do what is skillful follow the holy life for one who is born there is no freedom from death at present monks one who lives a long time is years old or a little bit more living years one lives for seasons seasons of cold seasons of heat seasons of rain living for seasons one lives for months months of cold months of heat months of rain living for months one lives for fortnights fortnights of cold fortnights of heat fortnights of rain living for fortnights one lives for days days of cold days of heat days of rain living for days one eats meals meals in the cold meals in the heat meals in the rain counting the taking of mother s milk and obstacles to eating these are the obstacles to eating when one doesn t eat while angered when one doesn t eat while suffering or stressed when one doesn t eat while sick when one doesn t eat on the observance thus monks i have reckoned the life of a person living for years i have reckoned the life span reckoned the seasons reckoned the years i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the the blessed one acquiesced with silence sensing his acquiescence the kapilavatthu sakyans got up from their seats bowed down to him circumambulated him and then went to the new reception hall on arrival they spread it all over with felt rugs arranged seats set out a water vessel and raised an oil lamp then they went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down stood to one side as they were standing there they said to him lord the reception hall has been covered all over with felt rugs seats have been arranged a water vessel has been set out and an oil lamp raised it is now time for the blessed one to do as he sees fit so the blessed one putting on his robe and taking up his bowl outer robe went together with a community of monks to the reception hall on arrival he washed his feet entered the hall and sat with his back to the central post facing east the community of monks washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the western wall facing east ranged around the blessed one the kapilavatthu sakyans washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the eastern wall facing west ranged around the blessed one then the blessed one having spent most of the night instructing urging rousing encouraging the kapilavatthu sakyans with a dhamma talk said to ven ananda responded as you say lord then the blessed one having arranged his outer robe folded in four lay down on his right side in the lion s sleeping posture with one foot on top of the other mindful alert having made a mental note to get up and how is the disciple of the noble ones consummate in virtue there is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is virtuous he dwells restrained in accordance with the patimokkha consummate in his behavior sphere of activity he trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faults this is how the disciple of the noble ones is consummate in virtue and how does the disciple of the noble ones guard the doors to his sense faculties there is the case where the disciple of the noble ones on seeing a form with the eye doesn t grasp at any theme or variations by which if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him he practices for its restraint he guards the faculty of the eye he achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the eye on hearing a sound with the ear on smelling an aroma with the nose on tasting a flavor with the tongue on feeling a tactile sensation with the body on cognizing an idea with the intellect he doesn t grasp at any theme or variations by which if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him he practices for its restraint he guards the faculty of the intellect he achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the intellect this is how the disciple of the noble ones guards the doors to his sense faculties and how does the disciple of the noble ones know moderation in eating there is the case where the disciple of the noble ones considering it appropriately takes his food not playfully nor for intoxication nor for putting on bulk nor for beautification but simply for the survival continuance of this body for ending its afflictions for the support of the holy life thinking i will destroy old feelings of hunger not create new feelings from overeating thus i will maintain myself be blameless live in comfort this is how the disciple of the noble ones knows moderation in eating and how is the disciple of the noble ones devoted to wakefulness there is the case where a disciple of the noble ones sitting pacing back forth cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check during the first watch of the night dusk to p m sitting pacing back forth he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check during the second watch of the night p m to a m reclining on his right side he takes up the lion s posture one foot placed on top of the other mindful alert with his mind set on getting up either as soon as he awakens or at a particular time during the last watch of the night a m to dawn sitting pacing back forth he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check this is how the monk is devoted to wakefulness there is the case where the disciple of the noble ones has conviction is convinced of the tathagata s awakening indeed the blessed one is worthy and rightly self awakened consummate in clear knowing conduct well gone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the teacher of divine human beings awakened blessed he feels shame at the thought of engaging in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct he feels concern for the suffering that results from bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct he has heard much has retained what he has heard has stored what he has heard whatever teachings are admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle

does the disciple of the noble ones obtain at will without trouble or difficulty the four jhanas that constitute heightened awareness and a pleasant abiding in the here now there is the case where quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities the disciple of the noble ones enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress he enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain this is how the disciple of the noble ones obtains at will without trouble or difficulty the four jhanas that constitute heightened awareness and a pleasant abiding in the here now now when a disciple of the noble ones is consummate in virtue in this way guards the doors to his sense faculties in this way knows moderation in eating in this way is devoted to wakefulness in this way is endowed with seven qualities in this way and obtains at will without trouble or difficulty the four jhanas that constitute heightened awareness and a pleasant abiding in the here now in this way then he is called a disciple of the noble ones who follows the practice for one in training whose eggs are unspoiled who is capable of breaking out capable of awakening capable of attaining the supreme rest from the yoke now when the disciple of the noble ones has arrived at this purity of equanimity mindfulness he recollects his manifold past lives i e one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction expansion there i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose there there too i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose here thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes details this is his first breaking out like that of the hen s chicks from their shells when the disciple of the noble ones has arrived at this purity of equanimity mindfulness he sees by means of the divine eye purified surpassing the human beings passing away re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior superior beautiful ugly fortunate unfortunate in accordance with their kamma these beings who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech mind who reviled noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell but these beings who were endowed with good conduct of body speech mind who did not revile noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world thus by means of the divine eye purified surpassing the human he sees beings passing away re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior superior beautiful ugly fortunate unfortunate in accordance with their kamma this is his second breaking out like that of the hen s chicks from their shells when the disciple of the noble ones has arrived at this purity of equanimity

among people when judging by clan but a person consummate in clear knowing conduct is the best of beings human divine this verse was well sung by the brahma sanankumara not ill sung well said not ill said connected with the goal not unconnected with the goal it was endorsed by the blessed one then the blessed one got up and said to ven ananda good good ananda what you have said to the kapilavatthu sakyans about the person who follows the practice for one in training is good that is what ven ananda said and the teacher approved gratified the kapilavatthu sakyans delighted in ven ananda s words thus have i heard at one time the lord was staying near savatthi in the jeta wood at anathapindika s monastery on that occasion a certain bhikkhu was sitting cross legged not far from the lord holding his body erect mindful and clearly comprehending enduring without complaint feelings that were painful acute sharp and severe the ripening of former action the lord saw that bhikkhu sitting cross legged not far away enduring without complaint feelings that were painful acute sharp and severe the ripening of former action then on realizing its significance the lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance a bhikkhu who has left behind all action shaking off the dust of former deeds the stable one unselfish steady has no need to address people i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further those who don t discern stress what brings stress into play where it totally stops without trace who don t know the path the way to the stilling of stress lowly in their awareness release discernment release incapable of making an end they re headed to birth aging but those who discern stress what brings stress into play where it totally stops without trace who discern the path the way to the stilling of stress consummate in their awareness release discernment release capable of making an end they aren t headed to birth aging now if there are any who ask would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way they should be told there would how would that be whatever stress comes into play is all from acquisition as a requisite condition this is one contemplation from the remainderless fading cessation of that very acquisition there is no coming into play of stress this is a second contemplation for a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way heedful ardent resolute one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis right here now or if there be any remnant of clinging sustenance non return that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further the manifold stresses that come into play in the world come from acquisition as their cause anyone not knowing this creates acquisition the fool he comes to stress again again therefore discerning this you shouldn t create acquisition as you contemplate birth as what brings stress into play now if there are any who ask would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way they should be told there would how would that be whatever stress comes into play is all from ignorance as a requisite condition this is one contemplation from the remainderless fading cessation of that very ignorance there is no coming into play of stress this is a second contemplation for a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way heedful ardent resolute one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis right here now or if there be any remnant of clinging sustenance non return that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further those who journey the wandering on through birth death again again in this state here or anywhere else that destination is simply through ignorance this ignorance is a great delusion whereby they have wandered on a long long time while beings immersed in clear knowing don t go to further becoming now if there are any who ask would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way they should be told there would how would that be whatever stress comes into play is all from fabrication as a requisite condition this is one contemplation from the remainderless fading cessation of that very fabrication there is no coming into play of stress this is a second contemplation for a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way heedful ardent resolute one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis right here now or if there be any remnant of clinging sustenance non return that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further any stress that comes into play is all from fabrication as a requisite condition with the cessation of fabrication there is no stress coming into play knowing this drawback that stress comes from fabrication as a requisite condition with the tranquilizing of all fabrication with the stopping of perception that s how there is the ending of stress knowing this as it actually is an attainer of wisdom sees rightly seeing rightly the wise overcoming the fetter of now if there are any who ask would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way they should be told there would how would that be whatever stress comes into play is all from consciousness as a requisite condition this is one contemplation from the remainderless fading cessation of that very consciousness there is no coming into play of stress this is a second contemplation for a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way heedful ardent resolute one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis right here now or if there be any remnant of clinging sustenance non return that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further any stress that comes into play is all from consciousness as a requisite condition with the cessation of consciousness there is no stress coming into play knowing this drawback that stress comes from consciousness as a requisite condition with the stilling of consciousness the monk free from hunger is totally unbound now if there are any who ask would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way they should be told there would how would that be whatever stress comes into play is all from contact as a requisite condition this is one contemplation from the remainderless fading cessation of that very contact there is no coming into play of stress this is a second contemplation for a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way heedful ardent resolute one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis right here now or if there be any remnant of clinging sustenance non return that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further for those overcome by contact flowing along in the stream of becoming following a miserable path the ending of fetters is far away while those who comprehend contact delighting in stilling through discernment they by breaking through contact free from hunger are totally unbound now if there are any who ask would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way they should be told there would how would that be whatever stress comes into play is all from feeling as a requisite condition this is one contemplation from the remainderless fading cessation of that very feeling there is no coming into play of stress this is a second contemplation for a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way heedful ardent resolute one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis right here now or if there be any remnant of clinging sustenance non return that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further knowing that whatever is felt pleasure pain neither pleasure nor pain within or without is stressful deceptive dissolving seeing its passing away at each contact each contact he knows it right there with just the ending of feeling there is no stress coming into play now if there are any who ask would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way they should be told there would how would that be whatever stress comes into play is all from craving as a requisite condition this is one contemplation from the remainderless fading cessation of that very craving there is no coming into play of stress this is a second contemplation for a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way heedful ardent resolute one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis right here now or if there be any remnant of clinging sustenance non return that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further with craving his companion a man wanders on a long long time neither in this state here nor anywhere else does he go beyond the wandering on knowing this drawback that craving brings stress into play free from craving devoid of clinging mindful the monk lives the wandering life now if there are any who ask would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way they should be told there would how would that be whatever stress comes into play is all from clinging as a requisite condition this is one contemplation from the remainderless fading cessation of that very clinging there is no coming into play of stress this is a second contemplation for a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way heedful ardent resolute one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis right here now or if there be any remnant of clinging sustenance non return that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further from clinging as a requisite condition comes becoming one who has come into being goes to stress there is death for one who is born this is the coming into play of stress thus with the ending of clinging the wise seeing rightly directly knowing the ending of birth go to no further becoming now if there are any who ask would there be the right contemplation of

gone the teacher said further any stress that comes into play is all from disturbance as a requisite condition with the cessation of disturbance there is no stress coming into play knowing this drawback that stress comes from disturbance as a requisite condition with the relinquishing of all disturbance a monk released in non disturbance his craving for becoming crushed his mind at peace his wandering on in birth totally ended he has no further becoming now if there are any who ask would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way they should be told there would how

of dualities in yet another way they should be told there would how would that be for one who is dependent there is wavering this is one contemplation one who is independent doesn t waver this is a second contemplation for a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way heedful ardent resolute one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis right here now or if there be any remnant of clinging sustenance non return that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further one who s independent doesn t waver one who s dependent clinging to this state here or anywhere else doesn t go beyond the wandering on knowing this drawback the great danger in dependencies in dependent free from clinging mindful the monk lives the wandering life now if there are any who ask would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way they should be told there would how would that be formless phenomena are more peaceful than forms this is one contemplation cessation is more peaceful than formless phenomena this is a second contemplation for a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way heedful ardent resolute one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis right here now or if there be any remnant of clinging sustenance non return that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further those beings headed to forms and those standing in the formless with no knowledge of cessation return to further becoming but comprehending form not taking a stance in formless things those released in cessation are people who ve left death behind now if there are any who ask would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way they should be told there would how would that be whatever is considered as this is true by the world with its devas maras brahmas with its contemplatives brahmans its royalty commonfolk is rightly seen as it actually is with right discernment by the noble ones as this is false this is one contemplation whatever is considered as this is false by the world with its devas maras brahmas with its contemplatives brahmans its royalty commonfolk is rightly seen as it actually is with right discernment by the noble ones as this is true this is a second contemplation for a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way heedful ardent resolute one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis right here now or if there be any remnant of clinging sustenance non return that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further see the world together with its devas conceiving not self to be self entrenched in name form they conceive that this is true in whatever terms they conceive it it turns into something other than that and that s what s false about it changing it s deceptive by nature undeceptive by nature is unbinding that the noble ones know as true they through breaking through to the truth free from hunger are totally unbound now if there are any who ask would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way they should be told there would how would that be whatever is considered as this is bliss by the world with its devas maras brahmas with its contemplatives brahmans its royalty commonfolk is rightly seen as it actually is with right discernment by the noble ones as this is stressful this is one contemplation whatever is considered as this is stressful by the world with its devas maras brahmas with its contemplatives brahmans its royalty commonfolk is rightly seen as it actually is with right discernment by the noble ones as this is bliss this is a second contemplation for a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way heedful ardent resolute one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis right here now or if there be any remnant of clinging sustenance non return that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further all sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations ideas that are welcome appealing agreeable as long as they re said to exist are supposed by the world together with its devas to be bliss but when they cease they re supposed by them to be stress the stopping of self identity is viewed by the noble ones as bliss this is contrary to what s seen by the world as a whole what others say is blissful the noble ones say is stress what others say is stressful the noble know as bliss see the dhamma hard to understand here those who don t know are confused for those who are veiled it s darkness blindness for those who don t see but for the good it is blatant like light for those who see though in their very presence they don t understand it dumb animals unadept in the dhamma it s not easy for those overcome by passion for becoming flowing along in the stream of becoming falling under mara s sway to wake up to this dhamma who apart from the noble is worthy to wake up to this state the state that through rightly knowing it they re free from fermentation totally unbound that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words and while this explanation was being given the minds of monks through lack of clinging were fully released from fermentation coming out from my day s abiding on vulture peak mountain i saw on the bank of a river an elephant emerged from its plunge a man holding a hook requested give me your foot the elephant extended its foot the man got up on the elephant seeing what was untrained now tamed brought under human control with that i centered my mind why i d gone to the woods in the first place i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said even if a monk is not skilled in the ways of the minds of others and how is a monk skilled in reading his own mind imagine a young woman or man fond of adornment examining the image of her own face in a bright clean mirror or bowl of clear water if she saw any dirt or blemish there she would try to remove it if she saw no dirt or blemish there she would be pleased her resolves fulfilled how fortunate i am how clean i am in the same way a monk s self examination is very productive in terms of skillful qualities if on examination a monk knows i usually remain covetous with thoughts of ill will overcome by sloth drowsiness restless uncertain angry with soiled thoughts with my body aroused lazy or unconcentrated then he should put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor relentlessness mindfulness alertness for the abandoning of those very same evil unskillful qualities but if on examination a monk knows i usually remain uncovetous without thoughts of ill will free of sloth drowsiness not restless gone beyond uncertainty not angry with unsoiled thoughts with my body unaroused with persistence aroused concentrated then his duty is to make an effort in maintaining those very same skillful qualities to a higher degree for the ending of the effluents setting at savatthi then in the morning the bhikkhuni vijaya dressed she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day s abiding then mara the evil one desiring to arouse fear trepidation and terror in the bhikkhuni vijaya you are so young and beautiful and i too am in the bloom of youth come noble lady let us rejoice with the music of a fivefold ensemble then it occurred to the bhikkhuni vijaya now who is this this is mara the evil one desiring to make me fall away from concentration then the bhikkhuni vijaya having understood this is mara the evil one replied to him in verses forms and sounds tastes and odors tactile objects that delight the mind i offer them right back to you for i o mara do not need them i am repelled and humiliated by this foul putrid body subject to break up fragile i ve uprooted sensual craving as to those beings who fare amidst form and those who abide in the formless and those peaceful attainments too everywhere darkness has been destroyed then mara the evil one realizing the bhikkhuni vijaya knows me sad and disappointed disappeared right there monks when right view is supported by five factors it has awareness release as its fruit awareness release as its reward it has discernment release as its fruit discernment release as its reward which five there is the case where right view is supported by virtue supported by learning supported by discussion supported by tranquillity supported by insight when supported by these five factors

awareness the line of thinking in ven anuruddha s awareness just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm disappeared from among the bhaggas in the deer park at bhesakala grove near crocodile haunt and re appeared among the cetis in the eastern bamboo park right in front of ven anuruddha there he sat down on a prepared seat as for ven anuruddha having bowed down to the blessed one he sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him good anuruddha very good it s good that you think these thoughts of a great person this dhamma is for one who is

of the cetis and reappeared among the bhaggas in the deer park at bhesakala grove near crocodile haunt he sat down on a prepared seat and as he was sitting there he addressed the monks monks i will teach you the eight thoughts of a great person listen pay close attention i will speak yes lord the monks responded this dhamma is for one who is modest not for one who is self aggrandizing thus was it said with reference to what was it said there is the case where a monk being modest does not want it to be known that he is modest being content he does not want it to be known that he is content

is self aggrandizing thus was it said and with reference to this was it said this dhamma is for one who is content not for one who is discontent thus was it said with reference to what was it said there is the case where a monk is content with any old robe cloth at all any old almsfood any old lodging any old medicinal requisites for curing sickness at all this dhamma is for one who is content not for one who is discontent thus was it said and with reference to this was it said this dhamma is for one whose persistence is aroused not for one who is lazy thus was it said with reference to what was it said there is the case where a monk keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities he is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities this dhamma is for one whose persistence is aroused not for one who is lazy thus was it said and with reference to this was it said this dhamma is for one whose mindfulness is established not for one whose mindfulness is confused thus was it said with reference to what was it said there is the case where a monk is mindful highly meticulous remembering able to call to mind even things that were done said long ago this dhamma is for one whose mindfulness is established not for one whose mindfulness is confused thus was it said and with reference to this was it said this dhamma is for one whose mind is centered not for one whose mind is uncentered thus was it said with reference to what was it said there is the case where a

monk s mind leaps up grows confident steadfast is firm in the cessation of objectification this dhamma is for one who enjoys non objectification who delights in non objectification not for one who enjoys delights in objectification thus was it said and with reference to this was it said knowing my thoughts the teacher unexcelled in the cosmos came to me through his power in a body made of mind he taught in line with my thoughts and then further the buddha delighting in non objectification taught non objectification knowing his dhamma i kept delighting in his bidding the three knowledges have been attained the buddha s bidding done thus have i heard at one time the lord was staying near savatthi in the jeta wood at anathapindika s monastery at that time there were a number of recluses and brahmans wanderers of various sects living around savatthi and they were of various views of various beliefs of various opinions and they relied for their support on their various views there were some recluses and brahmans who asserted and held this view the world is eternal only this is true any other view is false there were some recluses and brahmans who asserted the world is not eternal only this is true any other view is false there were some who asserted the world is finite the world is infinite the life principle and the body are the same the life principle and the body are different the tathagata exists beyond death the tathagata does not exist beyond death the tathagata both exists and does not exist beyond death the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist beyond death only this is true any other view is false and they lived quarrelsome disputatious and wrangling wounding each other with verbal darts saying dhamma is like this dhamma is not like that dhamma is not like this dhamma is like that then a number of bhikkhus having put on their robes in the forenoon and taken their bowls and outer cloaks entered savatthi for almsfood having walked in savatthi for almsfood and returned after the meal they approached the lord prostrated themselves sat down to one side and said to the lord at present revered sir there are a number of recluses and brahmans wanderers of various sects living around savatthi and they are of various views saying dhamma is like this dhamma is like that the wanderers of other sects bhikkhus are blind unseeing they do not know what is beneficial they do not know what is harmful they do not know what is dhamma they do not know what is not dhamma not knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful not knowing what is dhamma and what is not dhamma they are quarrelsome saying dhamma is like this dhamma is like that formerly bhikkhus there was a certain king in this very savatthi and that king addressed a man come now my good man bring together all those persons in savatthi who have been blind from birth yes your majesty that man replied and after detaining all the blind people in savatthi he approached the king and said all the blind people in savatthi have been brought together your majesty now my man show the blind people an elephant very well your majesty the man replied to the king and he presented an elephant to the blind people saying this blind people is an elephant to some of the blind people he presented the head of the elephant saying this is an elephant to some he presented an ear of the elephant saying this is an elephant to some he presented a tusk the trunk the body the foot the hindquarters the tail the tuft at the end of the tail saying this is an elephant then bhikkhus the man having shown the elephant to the blind people went to the king and said the blind people have been shown the elephant your majesty do now what you think is suitable then the king approached those blind people and said have you been shown the elephant yes your majesty we have been shown the elephant tell me blind people what is an elephant like those blind people who had been shown the head of the elephant replied an elephant your majesty is just like a water jar those blind people who had been shown the ear of the elephant replied an elephant your majesty is just like a winnowing basket those blind people who had been shown the tusk of the elephant replied an elephant your majesty is just like a plowshare those blind people who had been shown the trunk replied an elephant your majesty is just like a plow pole those blind people who had been shown the body replied an elephant your majesty is just like a storeroom those blind people who had been shown the foot replied an elephant your majesty is just like a post those blind people who had been shown the hindquarters replied an elephant your majesty is just like a mortar those blind people who had been shown the tail replied an elephant your majesty is just like a pestle those blind people who had been shown the tuft at the end of the tail replied an elephant your majesty is just like a broom saying an elephant is like this an elephant is not like that an elephant is not like this an elephant is like that they fought each other with their fists and the king was delighted with the spectacle even so bhikkhus are those wanderers of various sects blind unseeing saying dhamma is like this dhamma is like that then on realizing its significance the lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance some recluses and brahmans so called are deeply attached to their own views people who only see one side of things engage in quarrels and disputes thus have i heard at one time the lord was staying at calika on calika hill at that time the venerable meghiya was the lord s attendant then the venerable meghiya approached the lord prostrated himself stood to one side and said i wish to go into jantu village for almsfood revered sir do now meghiya what you think it is time to do then the venerable meghiya having put on his robe in the forenoon and taken his bowl and outer cloak entered jantu village for almsfood having walked in jantu village for almsfood after the meal on returning from collecting almsfood he approached the bank of the river kimikala as he was walking and wandering up and down beside the river for exercise he saw a pleasant and charming mango grove on seeing it he thought this mango grove is very pleasant and charming it is eminently suitable for the endeavor in meditation of a young man of good family who is intent on the endeavor if the lord were to give me permission i would come and endeavor in this mango grove then the venerable meghiya approached the lord prostrated himself sat down to one side and said revered sir having put on my robe in the forenoon i approached the bank of the river kimikala and saw a pleasant and charming mango grove on seeing it i thought this mango grove is very pleasant and charming it is eminently suitable for the endeavor in meditation of a young man of good family who is intent on the endeavor if the lord were to give me permission i would come and endeavor in this mango grove if revered sir the lord gives me permission i would go to that mango grove to endeavor in meditation when this was said the lord replied to the venerable meghiya as we are alone meghiya wait a while until some other bhikkhu comes a second time the venerable meghiya said to the lord revered sir the lord has nothing further that should be done and nothing to add to what has been done but for me revered sir there is something further that should be done and something to add to what has been done if revered sir the lord gives me permission i would go to that mango grove to endeavor in meditation a second time the lord replied to the venerable meghiya as we are alone meghiya wait a while until some other bhikkhu comes a third time the venerable meghiya said to the lord revered sir the lord has nothing further that should be done i would go to that mango grove to endeavor in meditation as you are talking of endeavoring meghiya what can i say do now meghiya what you think it is time to do then the venerable meghiya rose from his seat prostrated himself before the lord and keeping his right side towards him went to that mango grove on entering that mango grove he sat down at the foot of a certain tree for the rest period during the middle of the day now while the venerable meghiya was staying in that mango grove there kept occurring to him three bad unwholesome kinds of thoughts sensual thought malevolent thought and cruel thought the venerable meghiya then reflected it is indeed strange it is indeed remarkable although i have gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless state yet i am overwhelmed by these three bad unwholesome kinds of thoughts sensual thought malevolent thought and cruel thought then the venerable meghiya on emerging from seclusion in the late afternoon approached the lord prostrated himself sat down to one side and said revered sir while i was staying in that mango grove there kept occurring to me three bad unwholesome kinds of thoughts and i thought it is indeed strange i am overwhelmed by these three bad unwholesome kinds of thoughts sensual thought malevolent thought and cruel thought when mind deliverance is as yet immature meghiya five things lead to its maturity what five here meghiya a bhikkhu has good friends good associates good companions when mind deliverance is as yet immature meghiya this is the first thing that leads to its maturity furthermore meghiya a bhikkhu is virtuous he lives restrained by the restraint of the patimokkha endowed with conduct and resort seeing danger in the smallest faults he trains in the training rules he has accepted when mind deliverance is as yet immature meghiya this is the second thing that leads to its maturity furthermore meghiya a bhikkhu obtains at will with no trouble or difficulty talk that is effacing a help in opening up the mind and which conduces to complete turning away dispassion cessation peace direct knowledge enlightenment and nibbana that is talk about fewness of wishes talk about contentment talk about seclusion talk about being non gregarious talk about putting forth energy talk about virtue talk about concentration talk about wisdom talk about deliverance talk about the knowledge and vision of deliverance when mind deliverance is as yet immature meghiya this is the third thing that leads to its maturity furthermore meghiya a bhikkhu lives with energy instigated for the abandoning of unwholesome states and the acquiring of wholesome states he is vigorous energetic and persevering with regard to wholesome states when mind deliverance is as yet immature meghiya this is the fourth thing that leads to its maturity furthermore meghiya a bhikkhu is wise endowed with the noble ones penetrative understanding of rise and disappearance leading to the complete ending of suffering when mind deliverance is as yet immature meghiya this is the fifth thing that leads to its maturity when mind deliverance is as yet immature meghiya these five things lead to its maturity it is to be expected of a bhikkhu who has good friends good associates good companions that he will be virtuous that he will live restrained by the restraint of the patimokkha endowed with conduct and resort and that seeing danger in the smallest faults he will train in the training rules he has accepted it is to be expected of a bhikkhu who has good friends that he will obtain at will with no trouble or difficulty talk that is effacing a help in opening up the mind talk about the knowledge and vision of deliverance it is to be expected of a bhikkhu who has good friends that he will live with energy instigated vigorous energetic and persevering with regard to wholesome states it is to be expected of a bhikkhu who has good friends that he will be wise endowed with the noble ones penetrative understanding of rise and disappearance leading to the complete ending of suffering a bhikkhu meghiya who is established in these five things should also cultivate four additional things foulness should be cultivated for overcoming lust loving kindness should be cultivated for overcoming malevolence respiration mindfulness should be cultivated for cutting off discursive thinking the perception of impermanence should be cultivated for the removal of the conceit i am for when one perceives impermanence meghiya the perception of not self is established when one perceives not self one reaches the removal of the conceit i am which is called nibbana here and now then on realizing its significance the lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance trivial thoughts subtle thoughts mental jerkings that follow one along not understanding these mental thoughts one runs back and forth with wandering mind but having known these mental thoughts the ardent and mindful one restrains them an awakened one has entirely abandoned them these mental jerkings that follow one along patacara recalls the buddha s words dwelling on their own views quarreling different skilled people say whoever knows this understands dhamma whoever rejects this is imperfect thus quarreling they dispute my opponent s a fool unskilled which of these statements is true when all of them say they are skilled if in not accepting an opponent s doctrine one s a fool a beast of inferior discernment then all then a certain monk went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one lord what is the cause what is the reason why uncertainty doesn t arise in an instructed disciple of the noble ones over the undeclared issues because of the cessation of views monk uncertainty doesn t arise in an instructed disciple of the noble ones over the undeclared issues the view standpoint the tathagata exists after death the view standpoint the tathagata doesn t exist after death the view standpoint the tathagata both does and doesn t exist after death the view standpoint the tathagata neither does nor doesn t exist after death the uninstructed run of the mill person doesn t discern view doesn t discern the origination of view doesn t discern the cessation of view doesn t discern the path of practice leading to the cessation of view and so for him that view grows he is not freed from birth aging death from sorrows lamentations pains distresses and despairs he is not freed i tell you from suffering stress but the instructed disciple of the noble ones discerns view discerns the origination of view discerns the cessation of view discerns the path of practice leading to the cessation of view and so for him that view ceases he is freed from birth aging death from sorrows lamentations pains distresses and despairs he is freed i tell you from suffering stress thus knowing thus seeing the instructed disciple of the noble ones doesn t declare that the tathagata exists after death doesn t declare that the tathagata doesn t exist after death doesn t declare that the tathagata both does and doesn t exist after death doesn t declare that the tathagata neither does nor doesn t exist after death thus knowing thus seeing he is thus of a nature not to declare the undeclared issues thus knowing thus seeing he isn t paralyzed doesn t quake doesn t shiver or shake over the undeclared issues the tathagata exists after death this craving standpoint this perception standpoint this product of conceiving this product of elaboration this clinging standpoint that s anguish the uninstructed run of the mill person doesn t discern anguish doesn t discern the origination of anguish doesn t discern the cessation of anguish doesn t discern the path of practice leading to the cessation of anguish and so for him that anguish grows he is not freed from birth aging death from sorrows lamentations pains distresses and despairs he is not freed i tell you from suffering stress but the instructed disciple of the noble ones discerns anguish discerns the origination of anguish discerns the cessation of anguish discerns the path of practice leading to the cessation of anguish and so for him that anguish ceases he is freed from birth aging death from sorrows lamentations pains distresses and despairs he is freed i tell you from suffering stress thus knowing thus seeing the

thus seeing he isn t paralyzed doesn t quake doesn t shiver or shake over the undeclared issues then a certain monk went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one consummate in faculties consummate in faculties it is said to what extent is one consummate in faculties if a monk while keeping track of arising passing away with regard to the eye faculty becomes disenchanted with the eye faculty if while keeping track of arising passing away with regard to the ear faculty the nose faculty the tongue faculty the body faculty the intellect faculty he becomes disenchanted with the intellect faculty and disenchanted he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is fully released with full release there is the knowledge fully released he discerns that birth is depleted the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world it is to this extent that one is consummate in faculties i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in no then does master gotama hold the view the cosmos is not eternal only this is true anything otherwise is worthless no then does master gotama hold the view the cosmos is finite only this is true anything otherwise is worthless no then does master gotama hold the view the cosmos is infinite only this is true anything otherwise is worthless no then does master gotama hold the view the soul the body are the same only this is true anything otherwise is worthless no then does master gotama hold the view the soul is one thing and the body another only this is true anything otherwise is worthless no then does master gotama hold the view after death a tathagata exists only this is true anything otherwise is worthless no then does master gotama hold the view after death a tathagata does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthless no then does master gotama hold the view after death a tathagata both exists does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthless no then does master gotama hold the view after death a tathagata neither exists nor does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthless no how is it master gotama when master gotama is asked if he holds the view the cosmos is eternal after death a tathagata neither exists nor does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthless he says no in each case seeing what drawback then is master gotama thus entirely dissociated from each of these ten positions the position that the cosmos is not eternal the cosmos is finite the cosmos is infinite the soul the body are the same the soul is one thing and the body another after death a tathagata exists after death a tathagata does not exist after death a tathagata both exists does not exist after death a tathagata neither exists nor does not exist does not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation to calm direct knowledge full awakening unbinding does master gotama have any position at all a position vaccha is something that a tathagata has done away with what a tathagata sees is this such is form such its origination such its disappearance such is feeling such its origination such its disappearance such is perception such are fabrications such is consciousness such its origination such its disappearance because of this i say a tathagata with the ending fading away cessation renunciation relinquishment of all construings all excogitations all i making mine making obsessions with conceit is through lack of clinging sustenance released but master gotama the monk whose mind is thus released where does he reappear reappear vaccha doesn t apply in that case master gotama he does not reappear does not reappear vaccha doesn t apply both does does not reappear doesn t apply neither does nor does not reappear doesn t apply how is it master gotama when master gotama is asked if the monk reappears does not reappear both does does not reappear neither does nor does not reappear he says doesn t apply in each case at this point master gotama i am befuddled at this point confused the modicum of clarity coming to me from your earlier conversation is now obscured of course you re befuddled vaccha of course you re confused deep vaccha is this phenomenon hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle to be experienced by the wise for those with other views other practices other satisfactions other aims other teachers it is difficult to know that being the case i will now put some questions to you answer as you see fit yes and suppose someone were to ask you vaccha this fire burning in front of you dependent on what is it burning thus asked how would you reply i would reply this fire burning in front of me is burning dependent on grass timber as its sustenance if the fire burning in front of you were to go out would you know that this fire burning in front of me has gone out yes and suppose someone were to ask you this fire that has gone out in front of you in which direction from here has it gone east west north or south thus asked how would you reply that doesn t apply master gotama any fire burning dependent on a sustenance of grass and timber being unnourished from having consumed that sustenance and not being offered any other is classified simply as out unbound even so vaccha any physical form by which one describing the tathagata would describe him that the tathagata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising freed from the classification of form vaccha the tathagata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the sea reappears doesn t apply does not reappear doesn t apply both does does not reappear doesn t apply neither reappears nor does not reappear doesn t apply any feeling any perception any fabrication any consciousness by which one describing the tathagata would describe him that the tathagata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising freed from the classification of consciousness vaccha the tathagata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the sea reappears doesn t apply does not reappear doesn t apply both does does not reappear doesn t apply neither reappears nor does not reappear doesn t apply when this was said the wanderer vacchagotta said to the blessed one master gotama it is as if there were a great sala tree not far from a village or town from inconstancy its branches and leaves would wear away its bark would wear away its sapwood would wear away so that on a later occasion divested of branches leaves bark sapwood it would stand as pure heartwood in the same way master gotama s words are divested of branches leaves bark sapwood and stand as pure heartwood intoxicated with my complexion figure beauty fame haughty with youth i despised other women adorning this body embellished to delude foolish men i stood at the door to the brothel a hunter with snare laid out i showed off my ornaments and revealed many a private part i worked my manifold magic laughing out loud at the crowd today wrapped in a double cloak my head shaven having wandered for alms i sit at the foot of a tree and attain the state of no thought all ties human divine have been cut having cast off all effluents cooled am i unbound posala the buddha endowed with five qualities a monk pursuing mindfulness of breathing will in no long time penetrate the unprovoked release which five he is a person who imposes only a little on others one of few duties projects easy to support easily contented with the requisites of life he is a person who eats only a little food committed to not indulging his stomach he is a person of only a little sloth committed to wakefulness he is a person of much learning who has retained what he heard has stored what he has heard whatever teachings are admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end that in their meaning expression proclaim the holy life that is entirely complete pure those he has listened to often retained discussed accumulated examined with his mind and well penetrated in terms of his views he reflects on the mind as it is released endowed with these five qualities a monk pursuing mindfulness of breathing will in no long time penetrate the unprovoked then ven samiddhi went to based on name form sir and how do they go to diversity through the properties sir and what do they have as their origination they have contact as their origination sir and what do they have as their meeting place they have feeling as their meeting place sir and what do they have as their

were a pool of water sullied turbid and muddy a man with good eyesight standing there on the bank would not see shells gravel and pebbles or shoals of fish swimming about and resting why is that because of the sullied nature of the water in the same way that a monk with a sullied mind would know his own benefit the benefit of others the benefit of both that he would realize a superior human state a truly noble distinction of knowledge vision such a thing is impossible why is that because of the sullied nature of his mind i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said it s because of not understanding and not penetrating four things that we have wandered transmigrated on such a long long time you i which four it s because of not understanding and not penetrating noble virtue that we have wandered transmigrated on such a long long time you i it s because of not understanding and not penetrating noble concentration that we have wandered transmigrated on such a long long time you i it s because of not understanding and not penetrating noble discernment that we have wandered transmigrated on such a long long time you i it s because of not understanding and not penetrating noble release that we have wandered transmigrated on such a long long time you i but when noble virtue is understood penetrated when noble concentration noble discernment noble release is understood penetrated then craving for becoming is destroyed the guide to becoming craving attachment is ended there is now no further becoming that is what the blessed one said when the one well gone had said that he the teacher said further unexcelled virtue concentration discernment release have been understood by gotama of glorious stature having known them directly he taught the dhamma to the monks the awakened one the teacher who has put an end to suffering stress the one with vision totally unbound i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the then in the evening ven udayin left seclusion and went to the blessed one on arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one just now lord as i was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in my awareness so many painful things has the blessed one taken away from us so many pleasant things has he brought us so many unskillful qualities has the blessed one taken away from us so many skillful qualities has he brought us for in the past lord we used to eat in the morning in the evening and in the day at the wrong time the afternoon then there was the time when the blessed one addressed the monks saying monks please discontinue that daytime meal at the wrong time so we ate both in the evening in the morning then there was the time when the blessed one addressed the monks saying monks please discontinue that evening meal at the wrong time for just a day i was upset for just a day i was sad thinking the more exquisitely prepared of our two meals even that the blessed one has us abandon even that the one well gone has us relinquish it has happened lord that a man obtaining some good curry ingredients during the day would say to his wife put this aside and we ll all eat it together in the evening all fine cooking is done in the evening and next to none during the day but considering our love respect shame compunction around the blessed one we abandoned that evening meal at the wrong time it has happened lord that monks wandering for alms in the pitch dark of the night have walked into a waste water pool fallen into a cesspool stumbled over a thorn patch or stumbled over a sleeping cow they have encountered young hooligans on the way to or from a crime they have been sexually propositioned by women once i went for alms in the pitch dark of night a woman washing a pot saw me by a lightning flash and on seeing me screamed out i m done for a demon is after me when this was said i said to her i m no demon sister i m a monk waiting for alms then you re a monk whose daddy s dead and whose momma s dead better for you monk that your belly be slit open with a sharp butcher s knife than this prowling for alms for your belly s sake in the pitch dark of night on recollecting that lord the thought occurred to me so many painful things has the blessed one taken away from us so many pleasant things has he brought us so many unskillful qualities has the blessed one taken away from us so many skillful qualities has he brought us in the same way udayin there are some worthless men who when i tell them abandon this say why this petty elementary thing he s too much of a stickler this contemplative they don t abandon it they re rude to me and to the monks keen on training for them that s a strong snare a thick snare a heavy snare an unrotting snare and a thick yoke no lord that rotting creeper is for her a strong snare a thick snare a heavy snare an unrotting snare and a thick yoke in the same way udayin there are some worthless men who when i tell them abandon this say why this petty elementary thing he s too much of a stickler this contemplative they don t abandon it they re rude to me and to the monks keen on training for them that s a strong snare a thick snare a heavy snare an unrotting snare and a thick yoke now there are some clansmen who when i tell them abandon this say why does the blessed one have us abandon this why does the one well gone have us relinquish this petty elementary thing but they abandon it and are not rude to me or to the monks keen on training having abandoned it they live unconcerned unruffled their wants satisfied with their mind like a wild deer for them that s a weak snare a feeble snare a rotting snare an insubstantial snare no lord those thick leather snares were for him a weak snare a feeble snare a rotting snare an insubstantial snare in the same way udayin there are some clansmen who when i tell them abandon this say why does the blessed one have us abandon this why does the one well gone have us relinquish this petty elementary thing but they abandon it and are not rude to me or to the monks keen on training having abandoned it they live unconcerned unruffled their wants satisfied with their mind like a wild deer for them that s a weak snare a feeble snare a rotting snare an insubstantial snare no lord that single hut that single bed that single pot that single wife were for that man a strong snare a thick snare a heavy snare an unrotting snare and a thick yoke in the same way udayin there are some worthless men who when i tell them abandon this say why this petty elementary thing he s too much of a stickler this contemplative they don t abandon it they re rude to me and to the monks keen on training for them that s a strong snare a thick snare a heavy snare an unrotting snare and a thick yoke now suppose udayin that there were a householder or householder s son rich prosperous wealthy with vast amounts of gold ingots vast amounts of grain a vast number of fields a vast amount of land a vast number of wives and a vast number of male female slaves he would go to a park and see a monk his hands feet washed after a delightful meal sitting in the cool shade committed to the heightened mind the thought would occur to him how happy the contemplative state how free of disease the contemplative state o that i shaving off my hair beard and donning the ochre robe might go forth from the household life into homelessness and being able to abandon his vast amounts of gold ingots his vast amounts of grain his vast number of fields his vast amount of land his vast number of wives and his vast number of male female slaves he would be able to shave off his hair beard to don the ochre robe and to go forth from the household life into homelessness now suppose someone were to say those vast amounts of gold ingots and a vast number of male female slaves by which that householder or householder s son was snared but which he was able to abandon so that he could shave off his hair beard don the ochre robe and go forth from the household life into homelessness for him they were a strong snare a thick snare a heavy snare an unrotting snare and a thick yoke would the person speaking that way be speaking rightly no lord those vast amounts of gold ingots were for him a weak snare a feeble snare a rotting snare an insubstantial snare in the same way udayin there are some clansmen who when i tell them abandon this say why does the blessed one have us abandon this why does the one well gone have us relinquish this petty elementary thing but they abandon it and are not rude to me or to the monks keen on training having abandoned it they live unconcerned unruffled their wants satisfied with their mind like a wild deer for them that s a weak snare a feeble snare a rotting snare an insubstantial snare then there is the case where a certain person is practicing for the abandoning relinquishing of acquisitions as he is practicing for the abandoning relinquishing of acquisitions memories resolves associated with acquisitions assail him he does not acquiesce to them he abandons them dispels them demolishes them wipes them out of existence i tell you udayin that this sort of person is fettered not unfettered why is that because i have known the diversity of faculties with regard to this type of person then there is the case where a certain person is practicing for the abandoning relinquishing of acquisitions as he is practicing for the abandoning relinquishing of acquisitions then from time to time owing to lapses in mindfulness he is assailed by memories resolves associated with acquisitions slow is the arising of his mindfulness but then he quickly abandons those memories resolves dispels them demolishes them wipes them out of existence then there is the case where a certain person realizing that acquisitions are the root of suffering stress is without acquisitions released in the ending of acquisitions i tell you udayin that this sort of person is unfettered not fettered why is that because i have known the diversity of faculties with regard to this type of person there are these four types of people to be found existing in the world now there is the case where a monk quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation that i tell you comes under the perturbable and what comes under the perturbable there the directed thoughts evaluations that haven t ceased there that s what comes under the perturbable there there is the case where a monk with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance that i tell you comes under the perturbable and what comes under the perturbable there the rapture pleasure that hasn t ceased there that s what comes under the perturbable there there is the case where a monk with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding that i tell you comes under the perturbable and what comes under the perturbable there the equanimity pleasure that hasn t ceased there that s what comes under the perturbable there there is the case where a monk with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain now that i tell you comes under the imperturbable now there is the case where a monk enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation that i tell you isn t enough abandon it i tell you transcend it i tell you and what is its transcending there is the case where a monk enters remains in the second jhana that is its transcending but that too i tell you isn t enough abandon it i tell you transcend it i tell you and what is its transcending there is the case where a monk enters remains in the third jhana that is its transcending but that too i tell you isn t enough abandon it i tell you transcend it i tell you and what is its transcending there is the case where a monk enters remains in the fourth jhana that is its transcending but that too i tell you isn t enough abandon it i tell you transcend it i tell you and what is its transcending then there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving infinite space enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space that is its transcending but that too i tell you isn t enough abandon it i tell you transcend it i tell you and what is its transcending then there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space perceiving infinite consciousness enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness that is its transcending but that too i tell you isn t enough abandon it i tell you transcend it i tell you and what is its transcending then there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness perceiving there is nothing enters remains in the dimension of nothingness that is its transcending but that too i tell you isn t enough abandon it i tell you transcend it i tell you and what is its transcending then there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness enters remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non perception that is its transcending but that too i tell you isn t enough abandon it i tell you transcend it i tell you and what is its transcending there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception enters remains in the cessation of perception feeling that is its transcending thus udayin i speak even of the abandoning of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception do you see any fetter large or small of whose abandoning i don t speak no lord that is what the blessed one said gratified ven udayin delighted in the blessed one s words both this world and the world beyond have been revealed by him who knows what s within the reach of maraon one occasion but is there a path is there a practice for the full comprehension of these forms of stressfulness yes there is a path there is a practice for the full comprehension of these forms of stressfulness then what is the path what is the practice for the full comprehension of these forms of stressfulness precisely this noble eightfold path my friend right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration this is the path this is the practice for the full comprehension of these forms of stressfulness it s an auspicious path my friend an auspicious practice for the full comprehension of these forms of stressfulness enough for the sake of heedfulness at that time citta the householder was a sick man suffering from a serious illness then a number of devas that dwell in gardens forests and trees the devas of healing herbs and of great trees in the forest gathered together and said to citta the householder to this citta replied that is something impermanent something to be rejected and passed over now citta s friends colleagues and blood relations heard him say this and they said to him sir what have i said that makes you tell me to set up mindfulness and not to ramble why sir you just said that is something impermanent something to be rejected and passed over yes but i said that to the devas who dwell in gardens who bade me make a resolve that in some future time i might be a king a world ruler sir what purpose did those devas have in mind in urging you to make such a resolve this is what those devas thought this householder citta is a virtuous man of noble disposition if he makes a resolve that in some future time he may be a king a world ruler this will be profitable to that virtuous man having made such a resolve with a pure heart and will bring the just man a just and great reward so then i said that is something impermanent something to be rejected and passed over i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in today i am observing the uposatha lord visakha there are these three uposathas which three the uposatha of a cowherd the uposatha of the jains and the uposatha of the noble ones and what is the uposatha of a cowherd and what is the uposatha of the on the uposatha day they get their disciple to undertake the following practice here my good man having stripped off all your clothing say this i am nothing by anything or of anything thus there is nothing by anything or of anything that is mine yet in spite of that his parents know of him that this is our child and he knows of them that these are my parents his wives children know of him that this is our husband father and he knows of them that these are my wives children his workers slaves know of him that this is our master and he knows of them that these are my workers slaves thus at a time when he should be persuaded to undertake truthfulness he is persuaded to undertake falsehood at the end of the night he resumes the consumption of his belongings even though they aren t given back to him this counts as stealing i tell you such is the uposatha of the jains visakha when this uposatha of the jains is undertaken it is not of great fruit or great benefit not of great glory or great radiance and what is the uposatha of the noble ones it is the cleansing of the defiled mind through the proper technique and how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper technique again the uposatha of the noble ones is the cleansing of the defiled mind through the proper technique and how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper technique again the uposatha of the noble ones is the cleansing of the defiled mind through the proper technique and how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper technique again the uposatha of the noble ones is the cleansing of the defiled mind through the proper technique and how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper technique again the uposatha of the noble ones is the cleansing of the defiled mind through the proper technique and how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper technique furthermore the disciple of the noble ones reflects thus as long as they live the arahants abandoning the taking of life abstain from the taking of life they dwell with their rod laid down their knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beings today i too for this day night abandoning the taking of life abstain from the taking of life i dwell with my rod laid down my knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beings by means of this factor i emulate the arahants and my uposatha will be observed as long as they live the arahants abandoning the taking of what is not given abstain from taking what is not given they take only what is given accept only what is given live not by stealing but by means of a self that has become pure today i too for this day night abandoning the taking of what is not given abstain from taking what is not given i take only what is given accept only what is given live not by stealing but by means of a self that has become pure by means of this factor i emulate the arahants and my uposatha will be observed as long as they live the arahants abandoning uncelibacy live a celibate life aloof refraining from the sexual act that is the villager s way today i too for this day night abandoning uncelibacy live a celibate life aloof refraining from the sexual act that is the villager s way by means of this factor i emulate the arahants and my uposatha will be observed as long as they live the arahants abandoning false speech abstain from false speech they speak the truth hold to the truth are firm reliable no deceivers of the world today i too for this day night abandoning false speech abstain from false speech i speak the truth hold to the truth am firm reliable no deceiver of the world by means of this factor i emulate the arahants and my uposatha will be observed as long as they live the arahants abandoning fermented distilled liquors that cause heedlessness abstain from fermented distilled liquors that cause heedlessness today i too for this day night abandoning fermented distilled liquors that cause heedlessness abstain from fermented distilled liquors that cause heedlessness by means of this factor i emulate the arahants and my uposatha will be observed as long as they live the arahants live on one meal a day abstaining from food at night refraining from food at the wrong time of day from noon until dawn today i too for this day night live on one meal abstaining from food at night refraining from food at the wrong time of day by means of this factor i emulate the arahants and my uposatha will be observed as long as they live the arahants abstain from dancing singing music watching shows wearing garlands beautifying themselves with perfumes cosmetics today i too for this day night abstain from dancing singing music watching shows wearing garlands beautifying myself with perfumes cosmetics by means of this factor i emulate the arahants and my uposatha will be observed as long as they live the arahants abandoning high imposing seats beds abstain from high imposing seats beds they make low beds on a pallet or a spread of straw today i too for this day night abandoning high imposing seats beds abstain from high imposing seats beds i make a low bed on a pallet or a spread of straw by means of this factor i emulate the arahants and my uposatha will be observed such is the uposatha of the noble ones visakha when this uposatha of the noble ones is undertaken it is of great fruit great benefit of great glory great radiance and how is it of great fruit great benefit of great glory great radiance suppose that one were to exercise kingship rule sovereignty over these sixteen great lands replete with the seven treasures i e over the fifty human years are equal to one day night among the devas of the four great kings thirty such days nights make a month twelve such months make a year five hundred such heavenly years constitute the life span among the devas of the four great kings now it is possible that a certain man or woman from having observed this uposatha endowed with eight factors on the break up of the body after death might be reborn among the devas of the four great kings it was in reference to this that it was said kingship over human beings is a meager thing when compared with heavenly bliss a human century is equal to one day night among the devas of the thirty three thirty such days nights make a month one thousand such heavenly years constitute the life span among the devas of the thirty three now it is possible that a certain man or woman from having observed this uposatha endowed with eight factors on the break up of the body after death might be reborn among the devas of the thirty three it was in reference to this that it was said kingship over human beings is a meager thing when compared with heavenly bliss two human centuries are equal to one day night among the yama devas two thousand such heavenly years constitute the life span among the yama devas four human centuries are equal to one day night among the contented devas four thousand such heavenly years constitute the life span among the contented devas eight human centuries is equal to one day night among the devas who delight in creation eight thousand such heavenly years constitute the life span among the devas who delight in creation sixteen human centuries are equal to one day night among the devas who have power over the creations of others thirty such days nights make a month twelve such months make a year sixteen thousand such heavenly years constitute the life span among the devas who have power over the creations of others now it is possible that a certain man or woman from having observed this uposatha endowed with eight factors on the break up of the body after death might be reborn among the devas who have power over the creations of others it was in reference to this that it was said kingship over human beings is a meager thing when compared with heavenly bliss one should not kill a being or take what is not given should not tell a lie or be a drinker of strong drink should abstain from uncelibacy the sexual act should not eat at night the wrong time of day should not wear a garland or use a scent should sleep on a pallet a mat spread on the ground for this eight factored uposatha has been proclaimed by the awakened one to lead to the end of suffering stress the moon sun both fair to see shedding radiance wherever they go scattering darkness as they move through space brighten the sky illumining the quarters within their range is found wealth pearl crystal beryl lucky gem platinum nugget gold the refined gold called hataka yet they like the light of all stars when compared with the moon aren t worth one sixteenth of the eight factored uposatha so whoever man or woman is endowed with the virtues of the eight factored uposatha having done meritorious deeds productive of bliss beyond reproach goes to the heavenly state how short this life you die this side of a century but even if you live past you die of old age people grieve for what they see as mine mine mine just asmine in him staying at savatthi the blessed one said from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications from birth as a requisite condition then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair come into play such is the origination of this entire mass of stress suffering when this was said a certain monk said to the blessed one which aging death lord and whose is this aging death not a valid question the blessed one said if one were to ask which aging death and whose is this aging death and if one were to ask is aging death one thing and is this the aging death of someone something else both of them would have the same meaning even though their words would differ when there is the view that the soul is the same as the body there isn t the leading of the holy life and when there is the view that the soul is one thing and the body another there isn t the leading of the holy life avoiding these two extremes the tathagata points out the dhamma in between from birth as a requisite condition comes aging death which birth lord and whose is this birth not a valid question the blessed one said from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth which becoming lord and whose is this becoming not a valid question the blessed one said from clinging as a requisite condition comes becoming which clinging lord and whose is this clinging not a valid question the blessed one said from craving as a requisite condition comes clinging which craving lord and whose is this craving not a valid question the blessed one said from feeling as a requisite condition comes craving which feeling lord and whose is this feeling not a valid question the blessed one said from contact as a requisite condition comes feeling which contact lord and whose is this contact not a valid question the blessed one said from the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact which are the six sense media lord and whose are the six sense media not a valid question the blessed one said from name form as a requisite condition come the six sense media which name form lord and whose is this name form not a valid question the blessed one said from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name form which consciousness lord and whose is this consciousness not a valid question the blessed one said from fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness which fabrications lord and whose are the fabrications not a valid question the blessed one said if one were to ask which are the fabrications and whose are the fabrications and if one were to say fabrications are one thing and these fabrications are something someone else s both of them would have the same meaning even though their words would differ when there is the view that the life principle is the same as the body there is no leading the holy life and when there is the view that the life principle is one thing and the body another there is no leading the holy life avoiding these two extremes the tathagata points out the dhamma in between from ignorance as requisite condition come fabrications now from the remainderless fading cessation of that very ignorance every one of these writhings wrigglings wigglings which aging death and whose is this aging death or is aging death one thing and is this the aging death of someone something else or the soul is the same as the body or the soul is one thing and the body another are abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was living among the so it is householder so it is the body is afflicted weak encumbered for who looking after this body would claim even a moment of true health except through sheer foolishness so you should train yourself even though i may be afflicted in body my mind will be unafflicted that is how you should train yourself then the householder nakulapita delighting in approving of the blessed one s words rose from his seat and bowing down to the blessed one and circumambulating him keeping him to his right went to how could it be otherwise lord i have just now been sprinkled by the blessed one with the deathless ambrosia of a dhamma talk and how were you sprinkled by the blessed one with the deathless ambrosia of a dhamma talk just now i went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as i was sitting there i said to him lord i am a feeble old man aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life i am afflicted in body ailing with every moment and it is only rarely that i get to see the blessed one the monks who nourish the heart may the blessed one teach me may the blessed one instruct me for my long term benefit happiness when this was said the blessed one said to me so it is householder so it is the body is afflicted weak encumbered for who looking after this body would claim even a moment of true health except through sheer foolishness so you should train yourself even though i may be afflicted in body my mind will be unafflicted that is how you should train yourself that s how i was sprinkled by the blessed one with the deathless ambrosia of a dhamma talk but why didn t it occur to you to question the blessed one further in what way is one afflicted in body afflicted in mind and in what way is one afflicted in body but unafflicted in mind i would come from a long way away to hear the explication of these words in ven sariputta s presence it would be good if ven sariputta himself would enlighten me as to their meaning then in that case householder listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the householder nakulapita responded ven sariputta said now how is one afflicted in body afflicted in mind there is the case where an uninstructed run of the mill person who has no regard for noble ones is not well versed or disciplined in their dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not well versed or disciplined in their dhamma assumes form the body to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form he is seized with the idea that i am form or form is mine as he is seized with these ideas his form changes alters and he falls into sorrow lamentation pain distress despair over its change alteration he assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or feeling as in the self or the self as in feeling he is seized with the idea that i am feeling or feeling is mine as he is seized with these ideas his feeling changes alters and he falls into sorrow lamentation pain distress despair over its change alteration he assumes perception to be the self or the self as possessing perception or perception as in the self or the self as in perception he is seized with the idea that i am perception or perception is mine as he is seized with these ideas his perception changes alters and he falls into sorrow lamentation pain distress despair over its change alteration he assumes mental fabrications to be the self or the self as possessing fabrications or fabrications as in the self or the self as in fabrications he is seized with the idea that i am fabrications or fabrications are mine as he is seized with these ideas his fabrications change alter and he falls into sorrow lamentation pain distress despair over their change alteration he assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness he is seized with the idea that i am consciousness or consciousness is mine as he is seized with these ideas his consciousness changes alters and he falls into sorrow lamentation pain distress despair over its change alteration this householder is how one is afflicted in body and afflicted in mind and how is one afflicted in body but unafflicted in mind there is the case where a well instructed disciple of the noble ones who has regard for noble ones is well versed disciplined in their dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is well versed disciplined in their dhamma does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form he is not seized with the idea that i am form or form is mine as he is not seized with these ideas his form changes alters but he does not fall into sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair over its change alteration he does not assume feeling to be the self he does not assume perception to be the self he does not assume fabrications to be the self he does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness he is not seized with the idea that i am consciousness or consciousness is mine as he is not seized with these ideas his consciousness changes alters but he does not fall into sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair over its change alteration this householder is how one is afflicted in body but unafflicted in mind that is what ven sariputta said gratified the householder nakulapita delighted in ven sariputta s words on one occasion the blessed one was staying near lord i have won over this large following through the four grounds for the bonds of fellowship taught by the blessed one when i know that this person is to be won over by giving then i win him her over by giving when i know that this person is to be won over by kind words then i win him her over by kind words when i know that this person is to be won over by beneficial help then i win him her over by beneficial help it s good hatthaka it s very good that this is the means by which you have won over a large following all those in the past who have won over a large following have done so by means of these four same grounds for the bonds of fellowship all those in the future who will win over a large following will do so by means of these four same grounds for the bonds of fellowship all those at present who are winning over a large following do so by means of these four same grounds for the bonds of fellowship then having been instructed urged roused encouraged by the blessed one with a talk on dhamma hatthaka of alavi got up from his seat bowed down to the blessed one circled him keeping him on his right and left not long after he had left the blessed one said to the monks monks remember hatthaka of alavi as being endowed with eight amazing astounding qualities which eight hatthaka of alavi is endowed with conviction he is virtuous he has a sense of conscience he has a sense of concern for the results of unskillful actions he is learned he is generous he is discerning he is modest remember hatthaka of alavi as being endowed with these eight amazing astounding qualities monks a lay follower should not engage in five types of business which five business in weapons business in human beings business in meat business in intoxicants and business in poison these are the five types of business that a lay follower should not engage in from wrongness comes failure not success and how is it monks that from wrongness comes failure not success in a person of wrong view wrong resolve comes into being in a person of wrong resolve wrong speech in a person of wrong speech wrong action in a person of wrong action wrong livelihood in a person of wrong livelihood wrong effort in a person of wrong effort wrong mindfulness in a person of wrong mindfulness wrong concentration in a person of wrong concentration wrong knowledge in a person of wrong knowledge wrong release this is how from wrongness comes failure not success from rightness comes success not failure and how is it monks that from rightness comes success not failure in a person of right view right resolve comes into being in a person of right resolve right speech in a person of right speech right action in a person of right action right livelihood in a person of right livelihood right effort in a person of right effort right mindfulness in a person of right mindfulness right concentration in a person of right concentration right knowledge in a person of right knowledge right release this is how from rightness comes success not failure setting at savatthi then in the morning the bhikkhuni vajira dressed and taking bowl and robe entered savatthi for alms when she had walked for alms in savatthi and had returned from her alms round after her meal she went to the blind men s grove for the day s abiding having plunged into the blind men s grove she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day s abiding then mara the evil one desiring to arouse fear trepidation and terror in the bhikkhuni vajira desiring to make her fall away from concentration approached her and addressed her in verse by whom has this being been created where is the maker of the being where has the being arisen where does the being cease then it occurred to the bhikkhuni vajira now who is this that recited the verse a human being or a non human being then it occurred to her this is mara the evil one who has recited the verse desiring to arouse fear trepidation and terror in me desiring to make me fall away from concentration then the bhikkhuni vajira having understood this is mara the evil one replied to him in verses why now do you assume a being mara have you grasped a view this is a heap of sheer constructions here no being is found just as with an assemblage of parts the word chariot is used so when the aggregates are present there s the convention a being it s only suffering that comes to be suffering that stands and falls away nothing but suffering comes to be nothing but suffering ceases then mara the evil one realizing the bhikkhuni vajira knows me sad and disappointed disappeared right there thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living in the abode of alavaka the yakkha demon at alavi then alavaka approached the blessed one and said get out recluse samana very well friend so saying the blessed one went out come in recluse very well friend so saying the blessed one entered get out recluse said alavaka to the blessed one a second time very well friend so saying the blessed one went out come in recluse very well friend so saying the blessed one entered get out recluse said alavaka to the blessed one a third time very well friend so saying the blessed one went out come in recluse very well friend so saying the blessed one entered get out recluse said alavaka to the blessed one a fourth time no o friend i will not get out do what you will i will ask you a question recluse if you do not answer me i will confound your mind thoughts or cleave your heart or take you by your feet and fling you over to the further shore of the ocean well friend i do not see anyone in the world of then alavaka addressed the blessed one in verse what wealth here is best for man what well practiced will happiness bring what taste excels all other tastes how lived is the life they say is best having thus spoken alavaka said to the blessed one most excellent o gotama is thy teaching most excellent just as a man would set upright what is overturned reveal what is concealed point out the way to one gone astray bring an oil lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes could see objects even so the dhamma doctrine has been declared in many a manner by the venerable gotama i take refuge in the venerable gotama the buddha in the dhamma and in the sangha the order may the venerable gotama accept me as a disciple who has taken refuge from this day forth while life lasts the buddha alavaka the buddha alavaka the buddha samanasbrahmanas alavaka the kalamas of kesaputta go to see the buddha i heard thus once the blessed one while wandering in the then the kalamas who were inhabitants of kesaputta went to where the blessed one was on arriving there some paid homage to him and sat down on one side some exchanged greetings with him and after the ending of cordial memorable talk sat down on one side some saluted him raising their joined palms and sat down on one side some announced their name and family and sat down on one side some without speaking sat down on one side the kalamas of kesaputta ask for guidance from the buddha the kalamas who were inhabitants of kesaputta sitting on one side said to the blessed one there are some monks and brahmans venerable sir who visit kesaputta they expound and explain only their own doctrines the doctrines of others they despise revile and pull to pieces some other monks and brahmans too venerable sir come to kesaputta they also expound and explain only their own doctrines the doctrines of others they despise revile

as a realizing like a fishlike a fire like alike alike thelike alike a lionthus have i heard at one time the lord was staying near savatthi in the jeta wood at anathapindika s monastery at that time bahiya of the bark cloth was living by the seashore at supparaka he was respected revered honored venerated and given homage and was one who obtained the requisites of robes almsfood lodging and medicines now while he was in seclusion this reflection arose in the mind of bahiya of the bark cloth am i one of those in the world who are arahats or who have entered the path to arahatship then a devata who was a former blood relation of bahiya of the bark cloth understood that reflection in his mind being compassionate and wishing to benefit him he approached bahiya and said you bahiya are neither an arahant nor have you entered the path to arahatship you do not follow that practice whereby you could be an arahant or enter the path to arahatship then in the world including the devas who are arahats or have entered the path to arahatship there is bahiya in a far country a town called savatthi there the lord now lives who is the arahant the fully enlightened one that lord bahiya is indeed an arahant and he teaches dhamma for the realization of arahatship then bahiya of the bark cloth profoundly stirred by the words of that devata then and there departed from supparaka stopping only for one night everywhere along the way he went to savatthi where the lord was staying in the jeta wood at anathapindika s monastery at that time a number of bhikkhus were walking up and down in the open air then bahiya of the bark cloth approached those bhikkhus and said where revered sirs is the lord now living the arahant the fully enlightened one we wish to see that lord who is the arahant the fully enlightened one the lord bahiya has gone for almsfood among the houses then bahiya hurriedly left the jeta wood entering savatthi he saw the lord walking for almsfood in savatthi pleasing lovely to see with calmed senses and tranquil mind attained to perfect poise and calm controlled a perfected one watchful with restrained senses on seeing the lord he approached fell down with his head at the lord s feet and said teach me dhamma lord teach me dhamma sugata so that it will be for my good and happiness for a long time upon being spoken to thus the lord said to bahiya of the bark cloth it is an unsuitable time bahiya we have entered among the houses for almsfood a second time bahiya said to the lord it is difficult to know for certain revered sir how long the lord will live or how long i will live teach me dhamma lord teach me dhamma sugata so that it will be for my good and happiness for a long time a second time the lord said to bahiya it is an unsuitable time bahiya we have entered among the houses for almsfood a third time bahiya said to the lord it is difficult to know for certain teach me dhamma sugata so that it will be for my good and happiness for a long time herein bahiya you should train yourself thus in the seen will be merely what is seen in the heard will be merely what is heard in the sensed will be merely what is sensed in the cognized will be merely what is cognized in this way you should train yourself bahiya when bahiya for you in the seen is merely what is seen in the cognized is merely what is cognized then bahiya you will not be with that when bahiya you are not with that then bahiya you will not be in that when bahiya you are not in that then bahiya you will be neither here nor beyond nor in between the two just this is the end of suffering now through this brief dhamma teaching of the lord the mind of bahiya of the bark cloth was immediately freed from the taints without grasping then the lord having instructed bahiya with this brief instruction went away not long after the lord s departure a cow with a young calf attacked bahiya of the bark cloth and killed him when the lord having walked for almsfood in savatthi was returning from the alms round with a number of bhikkhus on departing from the town he saw that bahiya of the bark cloth had died seeing this he said to the bhikkhus bhikkhus take bahiya s body put it on a litter carry it away and burn it and make a stupa for it your companion in the holy life has died very well revered sir those bhikkhus replied to the lord taking bahiya s body they put it upon a litter carried it away and burnt it and made a stupa for it then they went to the lord prostrated themselves and sat down to one side sitting there those bhikkhus said to the lord bahiya s body has been burnt revered sir and a stupa has been made for it what is his destiny what is his future birth bhikkhus bahiya of the bark cloth was a wise man he practiced according to dhamma and did not trouble me by disputing about dhamma bhikkhus bahiya of the bark cloth has attained final nibbana then on realizing its significance the lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance this inspired utterance was spoken by the lord also so i did hear where neither water nor yet earth nor fire nor air gain a foothold there gleam no stars no sun sheds light there shines no moon yet there no darkness reigns when a sage a brahman has come to know this for himself through his own wisdom then he is freed from form and formless freed from pleasure and from pain monks a friend endowed with seven qualities is worth associating with which seven he gives what is hard to give he does what is hard to do he endures what is hard to endure he reveals his secrets to you he keeps your secrets when misfortunes strike he doesn t abandon you when you re down out he doesn t look down on you a friend endowed with these seven qualities is worth associating with he gives what is beautiful hard to give does what is hard to do endures painful ill spoken words his secrets he tells you your secrets he keeps when misfortunes strike he doesn t abandon you when you re down out doesn t look down on you a person in whom these traits are found is a friend to be cultivated by anyone wanting a friend staying at savatthi monks suppose there were a sharp bladed spear and a man were to come along saying with my hand or fist i will bend back this sharp bladed spear fold it in two and roll it up what do you think would that man be able with his hand or fist to bend back that sharp bladed spear fold it in two and roll it up no lord why is that because a sharp bladed spear isn t easy to bend back fold in two or roll up the man would simply reap his share of trouble vexation in the same way monks when a monk s awareness release through good will is cultivated developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated well undertaken any non human being who would think of possessing that monk s mind would simply reap his share of trouble vexation thus you should train yourselves our awareness release through good will will be cultivated developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated well undertaken that s how you should train yourselves at one time the then there where the venerable k mabh was there this was said householder with faultless part how then householder should the detailed or expanded meaning of this condensed statement be seen was this venerable one spoken by the blessed one just so householder so then venerable one please wait a moment while i look at its meaning and then citta the householder having been silent for a moment said this to the venerable k mabh faultless part now this venerable one is a metaphorical expression for the virtues adorned in white this venerable one is a metaphorical expression for liberation going one way this venerable one is a metaphorical expression for mindfulness rolls on this venerable one is a metaphorical expression for advancing and retreating chariot this venerable one is a metaphorical expression for this body of four great elements produced from mother and father accumulated out of boiled rice and grain subject to erosion abrasion dissolution and disintegration lust indeed venerable one is disturbance hatred is disturbance delusion is disturbance the one who is coming this venerable one is a metaphorical expression for the arahant flow this venerable one is a metaphorical expression for craving for a monk with poisonous mental influences destroyed this is abandoned broken at the root like a palm made groundless with sprouts annihilated such that thereafter it has no arising because of that a monk with poisonous mental influences destroyed is called one with flow cut off lust indeed venerable one is bondage hatred is bondage delusion is bondage for a monk with poisonous mental influences destroyed these are abandoned broken at the root like a palm made groundless with sprouts annihilated such that thereafter they have no arising because of that a monk with poisonous mental influences destroyed is called one who is unbound thus indeed venerable one is that which was said by the blessed one with faultless part adorned in white the one way chariot rolls on see it coming undisturbed with flow cut off unbound of this condensed statement venerable one spoken by the blessed one thus do i understand the detailed or expanded meaning it is understood by you householder it is well understood by you if monk anyone teaches a doctrine of disenchantment if anyone has trained himself in this disenchantment with decay and death in dispassion if anyone through disenchantment with decay and death through dispassion at that s the way it is great king that s the way it is those who engage in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct are not dear to themselves even though they may say we are dear to ourselves still they aren t dear to themselves why is that of their own accord they act toward themselves as an enemy would act toward an enemy thus they aren t dear to themselves but those who engage in good bodily conduct good verbal conduct good mental conduct are dear to themselves even though they may say we aren t dear to ourselves still they are dear to themselves why is that of their own accord they act toward themselves as a dear one would act toward a dear one thus they are dear to themselves that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further if you hold yourself dear then don t fetter yourself with evil for happiness isn t easily gained by one who commits a wrong doing when seized by the end maker as you abandon the human state what s truly your own what do you take along when you go what follows devata the buddha suppose that there is a foolish inexperienced unskillful cook who has presented a king or a king s minister with various kinds of curry mainly sour mainly bitter mainly peppery mainly sweet alkaline or non alkaline salty or non salty he does not take note of in the same way there are cases where a foolish inexperienced unskillful monk remains focused on the body in of itself ardent alert mindful putting aside greed distress with reference to the world as he remains thus focused on the body in of itself his mind does not become concentrated his defilements now suppose that there is a wise experienced skillful cook who has presented a king or a king s minister with various kinds of curry mainly sour mainly bitter mainly peppery mainly sweet alkaline or non alkaline salty or non salty he takes note of his master thinking today my master likes this curry or he reaches out for that curry or he takes a lot of this curry or he praises that curry today my master likes mainly sour curry today my master likes mainly bitter curry mainly peppery curry mainly sweet curry alkaline curry non alkaline curry salty curry today my master likes non salty curry or he reaches out for non salty curry or he takes a lot of non salty curry or he praises non salty curry as a result he is rewarded with clothing wages gifts why is that because the wise experienced skillful cook picks up on the theme of his own master in the same way there are cases where a wise experienced skillful monk remains focused on the body in of itself feelings in of themselves the mind in of itself mental qualities in of themselves ardent alert mindful putting aside greed distress with reference to the world as he remains thus focused on mental qualities in of themselves his mind becomes concentrated his defilements are abandoned he takes note of that fact as a result he is rewarded with a pleasant abiding here now together with mindfulness alertness why is that because the wise experienced skillful monk picks up on the theme of his own mind monks there are these five hindrances which five sensual desire as a hindrance ill will as a hindrance sloth drowsiness as a hindrance restlessness anxiety as a hindrance and uncertainty as a hindrance these are the five hindrances to abandon these five hindrances one should develop the four frames of reference which four there is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in of itself ardent alert mindful putting aside greed distress with reference to the world he remains focused on feelings in of themselves mind in of itself mental qualities in of themselves ardent alert mindful putting aside greed distress with reference to the world to abandon the five hindrances one should develop these four frames of reference jtb the first paragraphs of this sutta were originally listed here as an vijja bhagiya s with the last line defiled by passion as its own sutta listed as an vimutti s ag s translation was based on the thai tipitaka which differs from pts and bjt here and there so now they are merged into one per pts these two qualities have a share in clear knowing which two tranquillity when tranquillity is developed what purpose does it serve the mind is developed and when the mind is developed what purpose does it serve passion is abandoned when insight is developed what purpose does it serve discernment is developed and when discernment is developed what purpose does it serve ignorance is abandoned defiled by passion the mind is not released defiled by ignorance discernment does not develop thus from the fading of passion is there awareness release from the fading of ignorance is there discernment release jtb ag originally had the preceding line as a separate sutta vimutti sutta release but pts and bjt have it as part of the vijja bhagiya ii iii ten children having borne from this bodily congeries so i now weak and old approached a bhikkhuni the dhamma she taught me groups sense spheres and elements i heard the dhamma and having shaved my hair went forth while still a probationer i purified the eye divine former lives i knew and where i lived before one pointed well composed the signless i developed immediately released unclinging now and quenched knowing the five groups well they still exist but with their roots removed unmovable am i on a stable basis sure now rebirth is no more mahaanaama take the case of a man endowed with unwavering devotion to the buddha declaring he is the blessed one take the case of another man he is endowed with unwavering devotion to the buddha the dhamma the sangha he is joyous and swift in wisdom but has not gained release having destroyed the five lower fetters take the case of another man he is endowed with unwavering devotion to the buddha the dhamma the sangha but he is not joyous in wisdom and has not gained release yet by destroying three fetters take the case of another man he is endowed with unwavering devotion to the buddha the dhamma the sangha but he is not joyous in wisdom and has not gained release yet by destroying three fetters he is a stream winner not subject to rebirth in states of woe assured of enlightenment that man is entirely freed from states of woe take the case of another man he is not even endowed with unwavering devotion to the buddha the dhamma the sangha he is not joyous and swift in wisdom and has not gained release but perhaps he has these things the faculty of faith of energy of mindfulness of concentration of wisdom and the things proclaimed by the tathaagata are moderately approved by him with insight that man does not go to the realm of hungry ghosts to the downfall to the evil way to states of woe take the case of another man he is not even endowed with unwavering devotion to the buddha the dhamma the sangha he is not joyous and swift in wisdom and has not gained release but he has just these things the faculty of faith of energy of mindfulness of concentration of wisdom yet if he has merely faith merely affection for the tathaagata that man too does not go to states of woe why mahaanaama if these great sal trees could distinguish what is well spoken from what is ill spoken i would proclaim these great sal trees to be stream winners bound for enlightenment how much more so then sarakaani the sakyan mahaanaama sarakaani the sakyan fulfilled the training at the time of death i have heard that on one occasion when the blessed one was newly self awakened he was staying at just then these verses unspoken in the past unheard before occurred to the blessed one enough now with teaching what only with difficulty i reached this dhamma is not easily realized by those overcome with aversion passion what is abstruse subtle deep hard to see going against the flow those delighting in passion cloaked in the mass of darkness won t see as the blessed one reflected thus his mind inclined to dwelling at ease not to teaching the dhamma then that is what brahma sahampati said having said that he further said this in the past there appeared among the magadhans an impure dhamma devised by the stained throw open the door to the deathless let them hear the dhamma realized by the stainless one just as one standing on a rocky crag might see people all around below so o wise one with all around vision ascend the palace fashioned of the dhamma free from sorrow behold the people submerged in sorrow oppressed by birth aging then the blessed one having understood brahma s invitation out of compassion for beings surveyed the world with the eye of an awakened one as he did so he saw beings with little dust in their eyes and those with much those with keen faculties and those with dull those with good attributes and those with bad those easy to teach and those hard some of them seeing disgrace and danger in the other world just as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses some lotuses born and growing in the water might flourish while immersed in the water without rising up from the water some might stand at an even level with the water while some might rise up from the water and stand without being smeared by the water so too surveying the world with the eye of an awakened one the blessed one saw beings with little dust in their eyes and those with much those with keen faculties and those with dull those with good attributes and those with bad those easy to teach and those hard some of them seeing disgrace and danger in the other world having seen this he answered brahma sahampati in verse open are the doors to the deathless to those with ears let them show their conviction perceiving trouble o brahma i did not tell people the refined sublime dhamma then brahma sahampati thinking the blessed one has given his consent to teach the dhamma bowed down to the blessed one and circling him on the right disappeared right there monks i will explain to you the burden what monks is the burden the five groups of clinging what is the laying hold of the burden the answer is that it is the person what is the holding on to the burden the answer is that it is that craving which gives rise to fresh rebirth and bound up with lust and greed now here now there finds ever fresh delight it is sensual craving what is the laying down of the burden it is the complete fading away and extinction of this craving its forsaking and giving up liberation and detachment from it this monks is called the laying down of the burden thus said the blessed one the well farer the five groups are the heavy load the seizing of the load is man holding it is misery laying down the load is bliss laying down this heavy load and no other taking up by uprooting all desire hunger s stilled nibbaana s gained i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was dwelling among the the blessed one said there are these four qualities tigerpaw that lead to a lay person s happiness and well being in this life which four being consummate in initiative being consummate in vigilance admirable friendship and maintaining one s livelihood in tune and what does it mean to be consummate in initiative there is the case where a lay person by whatever occupation he makes his living whether by farming or trading or cattle tending or archery or as a king s man or by any other craft is clever and untiring at it endowed with discrimination in its techniques enough to arrange and carry it out this is called being consummate in initiative and what does it mean to be consummate in vigilance there is the case when a lay person has righteous wealth righteously gained coming from his initiative his striving his making an effort gathered by the strength of his arm earned by his sweat he manages to protect it through vigilance with the thought how shall neither kings nor thieves make off with this property of mine nor fire burn it nor water sweep it away nor hateful heirs make off with it this is called being consummate in vigilance and what is meant by admirable friendship there is the case where a lay person in whatever town or village he may dwell spends time with householders or householders sons young or old who are advanced in virtue he talks with them engages them in discussions he emulates consummate conviction in those who are consummate in conviction consummate virtue in those who are consummate in virtue consummate generosity in those who are consummate in generosity and consummate discernment in those who are consummate in discernment this is called admirable friendship and what does it mean to maintain one s livelihood in tune there is the case where a lay person knowing the income and outflow of his wealth maintains a livelihood in tune neither a spendthrift nor a penny pincher thinking thus will my income exceed my outflow and my outflow will not exceed my income these are the four drains on one s store of wealth debauchery in sex debauchery in drink debauchery in gambling and evil friendship evil companionship evil camaraderie these are the four inlets to one s store of wealth no debauchery in sex no debauchery in drink no debauchery in gambling and admirable friendship admirable companionship admirable camaraderie just as if there were a great reservoir with four inlets and four drains and a man were to open the inlets and close the drains and the sky were to pour down proper showers the increase of that great reservoir could be expected not its depletion in the same way these are the four inlets to one s store of wealth no debauchery in sex no debauchery in drink no debauchery in gambling and admirable friendship admirable companionship admirable camaraderie these tigerpaw are the four qualities that lead to a lay person s happiness and well being in this life there are these four qualities that lead to a lay person s happiness and well being in lives to come which four being consummate in conviction being consummate in virtue being consummate in generosity being consummate in discernment and what does it mean to be consummate in conviction there is the case where a

in lives to come heedful at administering or working at one s occupation maintaining one s life in tune one protects one s store of wealth a person of conviction consummate in virtue magnanimous free of selfishness constantly clears the path to security in the lives to come thus for one who seeks the household life these eight qualities leading to welfare happiness both in this life in lives to come have been declared by the one whose name is truth and this is how for householders generosity merit increase then there is the case where the disciple of the noble ones using the wealth earned through his efforts enterprise amassed through the strength of his arm and piled up through the sweat of his brow righteous wealth righteously gained provides himself with pleasure satisfaction and maintains that pleasure rightly he provides his mother father with pleasure satisfaction and maintains that pleasure rightly he provides his children his wife his slaves servants assistants with

so happens that when a disciple of the noble ones obtains these five benefits from wealth his wealth goes to depletion the thought occurs to him even though my wealth has gone to depletion i have obtained the five benefits that can be obtained from wealth and he feels no remorse if it so happens that when a disciple of the noble ones obtains these five benefits from wealth his wealth increases the thought occurs to him i have obtained the five benefits that can be obtained from wealth and my wealth has increased and he feels no remorse so he feels no remorse in either case my wealth has been enjoyed my dependents supported protected from calamities by me i have given supreme offerings performed the five oblations i have provided for the virtuous the restrained followers of the holy life for whatever aim a wise householder would desire wealth that aim i have attained i have done what will not lead to future distress when this is recollected by a mortal a person established in the

in this way may my lord ananda please accept this confession of my transgression as such so that i may restrain myself in the future yes sister a transgression overcame you in that you were so foolish

blessed one was staying near now on that occasion uggahamana was sitting with his large following of wanderers all making a great noise racket discussing many kinds of bestial topics of conversation conversation about kings robbers ministers of state armies alarms battles food drink clothing furniture garlands scents relatives vehicles villages towns cities the countryside women heroes the gossip of the street the well tales of the dead tales of diversity the creation of the world of the sea talk of whether things exist or not then uggahamana saw pa cakanga the carpenter coming from afar and

crying even the thought resolve does not occur to it so from where would it resolve on any evil resolve aside from a little bad temper even the thought livelihood does not occur to it so from where

unbinding was the liberation of awareness once monks in meanwhile king dighiti had set out for varanasi together with his consort and traveling by stages arrived there there he lived with her on the outskirts of varanasi in a potter s house disguised as a wanderer not long afterwards she became pregnant she had a pregnancy wish of this sort she wanted to see a fourfold army armed arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swords she said to king dighiti your majesty i am pregnant and i have a pregnancy wish of this sort i want to see a fourfold army armed arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swords he said my queen where is there for us fallen on hard times a fourfold army armed arrayed standing on a parade ground and water used for washing the swords if i don t get this your majesty i will die now at that time the brahman adviser to king brahmadatta was a friend of king dighiti so king dighiti went to him and on arrival said a lady friend of yours old friend is pregnant and she has a pregnancy wish of this sort she wants to see a fourfold army armed arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swords in that case let me see her so king dighiti s consort went to king brahmadatta s brahman adviser when he saw her coming from afar he rose from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder and with his hands raised in salutation to her exclaimed three times surely the king of kosala has come to your womb surely the king of kosala has come to your womb don t be worried my queen you will get to see a fourfold army armed arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swords then he went to king brahmadatta and on arrival said to him your majesty signs have appeared such that tomorrow at dawn a fourfold army armed arrayed should stand on a parade ground and that the swords should be washed so king brahmadatta ordered his people i say then do as the brahman adviser says thus king dighiti s chief consort got to see a fourfold army armed arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and got to drink the water used for washing the swords then with the maturing of the fetus she gave birth to a son whom they named now at that time king dighiti s barber had gone over to king brahmadatta he saw king dighiti together with his consort living on the outskirts of varanasi in a potter s house disguised as a wanderer on seeing them he went to king brahmadatta and on arrival said to him your majesty king dighiti of kosala together with his consort is living on the outskirts of varanasi in a potter s house disguised as a wanderer so king brahmadatta ordered his people i say

vengeance is settled through non vengeance when this was said the people said to him this king dighiti has gone crazy he s talking nonsense who is dighavu why is he saying don t my dear dighavu be far sighted don t be near sighted for vengeance is not settled through vengeance vengeance is settled through non vengeance i m not crazy or talking nonsense he who knows will understand then a second time a third time he said don t my dear dighavu be far sighted don t be near sighted for vengeance is not settled through vengeance vengeance is settled through non vengeance a third time the people said to him this king dighiti has gone crazy he s talking nonsense who is dighavu why is he saying don t my dear dighavu be far sighted don t be near sighted for vengeance is not settled through vengeance vengeance is settled through non vengeance i m not crazy or talking nonsense he who knows will understand then the king s people having marched king dighiti together with his chief consort to a harsh sounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evicted them out the south gate of the city and there to the south of the city cut them into four pieces buried them in holes placed in the four directions stationed guards and left then prince dighavu having entered varanasi brought out some liquor and got the guards to drink it when they had fallen down drunk he collected sticks made a pyre raised the bodies of his mother father onto the pyre set fire to it and then circumambulated it three times with his hands raised in salutation now at that time king brahmadatta had gone up to the terrace on top of his palace he saw prince dighavu circumambulating the pyre three times with his hands raised in salutation and on seeing him the thought occurred to him doubtlessly this person is a relative or blood kinsman of king dighiti ah how unfortunate for me for there is no one who will tell me what this means then prince dighavu having gone into the wilderness and having cried wept as much as he needed to dried his tears and entered varanasi going to an elephant stable next to the king s palace he said to the chief elephant trainer teacher i want to learn this craft in that case young man you may learn it then rising in the last watch of the night prince dighavu sang in a sweet voice and played the lute in the elephant stable king brahmadatta also rising in the last watch of the night heard the sweet voiced singing lute playing in the elephant stable on hearing it he asked his people i say who was that rising in the last watch of the night singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stable your majesty a young man the student of such and such an elephant trainer rising in the last watch of the night was singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stable i say then go fetch that young man responding as you say your majesty they went and fetched prince dighavu then king brahmadatta said to prince dighavu i say was that you rising in the last watch of the night singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stable yes your majesty i say then my young man sing and play the lute responding as you say your majesty and seeking to win favor prince dighavu sang with a sweet voice and played the lute then king brahmadatta said to him i say you my young man are to stay and attend to me as you say your majesty prince dighavu replied then he rose in the morning before king brahmadatta went to bed in the evening after him did whatever the king ordered always acting to please him speaking politely to him and it was not long before king brahmadatta placed the prince close to him in a position of trust then one day king brahmadatta said to prince dighavu i say then my young man harness the chariot i m going hunting responding as you say your majesty prince dighavu harnessed the chariot and then said to king brahmadatta your chariot is harnessed your majesty now is the time for you to do as you see fit then king brahmadatta mounted the chariot and prince dighavu drove it he drove it in such a way that the king s entourage went one way and the chariot another then after they had gone far king brahmadatta said to prince dighavu i say then my young man unharness the chariot i m tired i m going to lie down responding as you say your majesty prince dighavu unharnessed the chariot and sat down cross legged on the ground then king brahmadatta lay down placing his head on prince dighavu s lap as he was tired he went to sleep right away then the thought occurred to prince dighavu this king brahmadatta of kasi has done us great harm he has seized our troops vehicles lands armories granaries and it was because of him that my mother father were killed now is my chance to wreak vengeance he drew his sword from his scabbard but then he thought my father told me as he was about to die don t my dear dighavu be far sighted don t be near sighted for vengeance is not settled through vengeance vengeance is settled through non vengeance it would not be proper for me to transgress my father s words so he put his sword back in its scabbard a second time a third time the thought occurred to prince dighavu this king brahmadatta of kasi has done us great harm he has seized our troops vehicles lands armories granaries and it was because of him that my mother father were killed now is my chance to wreak vengeance he drew his sword from his scabbard but then he thought my father told me as he was about to die don t my dear dighavu be far sighted don t be near sighted for vengeance is not settled through vengeance vengeance is settled through non vengeance it would not be proper for me to transgress my father s words so once again he put his sword back in its scabbard then king brahmadatta suddenly got up frightened agitated unnerved alarmed prince dighavu said to him your majesty why have you gotten up suddenly frightened agitated unnerved alarmed i say my young man just now as i was dreaming prince dighavu son of dighiti king of kasi struck me down with a sword then prince dighavu grabbing king brahmadatta by the head with his left hand and drawing his sword from its scabbard with his right said i your majesty am that very prince dighavu son of dighiti king of kasi you have done us great harm you have seized our troops vehicles lands armories granaries and it was because of you that my mother father were killed now is my chance to wreak vengeance so king brahmadatta dropping his head down to prince dighavu s feet said grant me my life my dear dighavu grant me my life my dear dighavu who am i that i would dare grant life to your majesty it is your majesty who should grant life to me in that case my dear dighavu you grant me my life and i grant you your life then king brahmadatta and prince dighavu granted one another their lives and taking one another by the hands swore an oath to do one another no harm then king brahmadatta said to prince dighavu in that case my dear dighavu harness the chariot we will go on responding as you say your majesty prince dighavu harnessed the chariot and then said to king brahmadatta your chariot is harnessed your majesty now is the time for you to do as you see fit then king brahmadatta mounted the chariot and prince dighavu drove it he drove it in such a way that it was not long before they met up with the king s entourage then king brahmadatta having entered varanasi had his ministers councilors convened and said to them i say then if you were to see prince dighavu the son of dighiti the king of kasi what would you do to him different ministers said we would cut of his hands your majesty we would cut off his feet your majesty we would cut off his hands feet your majesty we would cut off his ears your majesty we would cut off his nose your majesty we would cut off his ears nose your majesty we would cut off his head your majesty then the king said this i say is prince dighavu the son of dighiti the king of kasi you are not allowed to do anything to him it was by him that my life was granted to me and it was by me that his life was granted to him then king brahmadatta said to prince dighavu what your father said to you as he was about to die don t my dear dighavu be far sighted don t be near sighted for vengeance is not settled through vengeance vengeance is settled through non vengeance in reference to what did he say that what my father said to me as he was about to die don t be far sighted don t bear vengeance for a long time is what he was saying to me as he was about to die and what he said to me as he was about to die don t be near sighted don t be quick to break with a friend is what he was saying to me as he was about to die and what he said to me as he was about to die for vengeance is not settled through vengeance vengeance is settled through non vengeance my mother father were killed by your majesty if i were to deprive your majesty of life those who hope for your majesty s well being would deprive me of life and those who hope for my well being would deprive them of life and in that way vengeance would not be settled by vengeance but now i have been granted my life by your majesty and your majesty has been granted your life by me and in this way vengeance has been settled by non vengeance that is what my father was saying to me as he was about to die then king brahmadatta said isn t it amazing isn t it astounding how wise this prince dighavu is in that he can understand in full the meaning of what his father said in brief so he returned his father s troops vehicles lands armories granaries and gave him his daughter in marriage such monks is the forbearance gentleness of kings who wield the scepter who wield the sword so now let your light shine forth so that you who have gone forth in such a well taught dhamma discipline will be their equal in forbearance gentleness i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at yes lord the monks replied and what are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to whatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen fermentation of sensuality arises in him and the arisen fermentation of sensuality increases the unarisen fermentation of becoming arises in him and arisen fermentation of becoming increases the unarisen fermentation of ignorance arises in him and the arisen fermentation of ignorance increases these are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to and what are the ideas fit for attention that he does not attend to whatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen fermentation of sensuality does not arise in him and the arisen fermentation of sensuality is abandoned the unarisen fermentation of becoming does not arise in him and arisen fermentation of becoming is abandoned the unarisen fermentation of ignorance does not arise in him and the arisen fermentation of ignorance is abandoned these are the ideas fit for attention that he does not attend to through his attending to ideas unfit for attention and through his not attending to ideas fit for attention both unarisen fermentations arise in him and arisen fermentations increase this is how as he attends inappropriately in this way one of six kinds of view arises in him the view the well instructed disciple of the noble ones who has regard for noble ones is well versed disciplined in their dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is well versed disciplined in their dhamma discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attention this being so he does not attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends instead to ideas fit for attention and what are the ideas unfit for attention that he does not attend to whatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen fermentation of sensuality arises in him and the arisen fermentation of sensuality increases the unarisen fermentation of becoming arises in him and arisen fermentation of becoming increases the unarisen fermentation of ignorance arises in him and the arisen fermentation of ignorance increases these are the ideas unfit for attention that he does not attend to and what are the ideas fit for attention that he does attend to whatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen fermentation of sensuality does not arise in him and the arisen fermentation of sensuality is abandoned the unarisen fermentation of becoming does not arise in him and the arisen fermentation of becoming is abandoned the unarisen fermentation of ignorance does not arise in him and the arisen fermentation of ignorance is abandoned these are the ideas fit for attention that he does attend to through his not attending to ideas unfit for attention and through his attending to ideas fit for attention unarisen fermentations do not arise in him and arisen fermentations are abandoned he attends appropriately reflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the ear faculty reflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the nose faculty reflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the tongue faculty reflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the body faculty reflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the intellect faculty the fermentations vexation or fever that would arise if he were to dwell unrestrained with the restraint of the intellect faculty do not arise for him when he dwells restrained with the restraint of the intellect faculty these are called the fermentations to be abandoned by restraining reflecting appropriately he uses almsfood not playfully nor for intoxication nor for putting on bulk nor for beautification but simply for the survival continuance of this body for ending its afflictions for the support of the holy life thinking thus will i destroy old feelings of hunger and not create new feelings from overeating i will maintain myself be blameless live in comfort reflecting appropriately he uses lodging simply to counteract cold to counteract heat to counteract the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun reptiles simply for protection from the inclemencies of weather and for the enjoyment of seclusion reflecting appropriately he uses medicinal requisites that are used for curing the sick simply to counteract any pains of illness that have arisen and for maximum freedom from disease the fermentations vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to use these things in this way do not arise for him when he uses them in this way these are called the fermentations to be abandoned by using reflecting appropriately he does not tolerate an arisen thought of ill will reflecting appropriately he does not tolerate an arisen thought of cruelty reflecting appropriately he does not tolerate arisen evil unskillful mental qualities he abandons them dispels them wipes them out of existence the effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to dispel these things do not arise for him when he dispels them these are called the fermentations to be abandoned by dispelling when a monk s fermentations that should be abandoned by seeing have been abandoned by seeing his fermentations that should be abandoned by restraining have been abandoned by restraining his fermentations that should be abandoned by using have been abandoned by using his fermentations that should be abandoned by tolerating have been abandoned by tolerating his fermentations that should be abandoned by avoiding have been abandoned by avoiding his fermentations that should be abandoned by dispelling have been abandoned by dispelling his fermentations that should be abandoned by developing have been abandoned by developing then he is called a monk who dwells restrained with the restraint of all the fermentations he has severed craving thrown off the fetters and through the right penetration of conceit has made an end of suffering stress that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words thus i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living at gaya at gayasisa together with a thousand bhikkhus there he addressed the bhikkhus bhikkhus all is burning and what is the all that is burning the eye is burning forms are burning eye consciousness is burning eye contact is burning also whatever is felt as pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant that arises with eye contact for its indispensable condition that too is burning burning with what burning with the fire of lust with the fire of hate with the fire of delusion i say it is burning with birth aging and death with sorrows with lamentations with pains with griefs with despairs the ear is burning sounds are burning the nose is burning odors are burning the tongue is burning flavors are burning the body is burning tangibles are burning the mind is burning ideas are burning mind consciousness is burning mind contact is burning also whatever is felt as pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant that arises with mind contact for its indispensable condition that too is burning burning with what burning with the fire of lust with the fire of hate with the fire of delusion i say it is burning with birth aging and death with sorrows with lamentations with pains with griefs with despairs bhikkhus when a noble follower who has heard the truth sees thus he finds estrangement in the eye finds estrangement in forms finds estrangement in eye consciousness finds estrangement in eye contact and whatever is felt as pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant that arises with eye contact for its indispensable condition in that too he finds estrangement he finds estrangement in the ear in sounds he finds estrangement in the nose in odors he finds estrangement in the tongue in flavors he finds estrangement in the body in tangibles he finds estrangement in the mind finds estrangement in ideas finds estrangement in mind consciousness finds estrangement in mind contact and whatever is felt as pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant that arises with mind contact for its indispensable condition in that too he finds estrangement when he finds estrangement passion fades out with the fading of passion he is liberated when liberated there is knowledge that he is liberated he understands birth is exhausted the holy life has been lived out what can be done is done of this there is no more beyond that is what the blessed one said the bhikkhus were glad and they approved his words now during his utterance the hearts of those thousand bhikkhus were liberated from taints through clinging no more monks there are these these are four types of individuals to be found existing in the world thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living near savatthi at jetavana at anathpindika s monastery at that time candima the moon deity was seized by rahu lord of asura thereupon calling to mind the blessed one candima the moon deity recited this stanza thereupon the blessed one addressed a stanza to rahu lord of asuras on behalf of candima thus thereupon rahu lord of asuras released candima the deity and immediately came to the presence of vepacitta lord of asuras and stood beside him trembling with fear and with hair standing on end then vepacitta addressed rahu in this stanza i have been spoken to by the buddha in a stanza requesting me to release candima if i had not released candima my head would have split into seven pieces while yet i live i should have had no happiness therefore i released candima there is o monks worldly joy now o monks what is worldly joy there are these five cords of sense desire forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for and desired agreeable and endearing associated with sense desire and tempting to lust sounds cognizable by the ear odors cognizable by the nose flavors cognizable by the tongue tangibles cognizable by the body wished for and desired agreeable and endearing associated with sense desire and tempting to lust it is the joy that arises dependent on these five cords of sense desire which is called worldly joy now what is unworldly joy quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unwholesome states of mind a monk enters upon and abides in the and what is the still greater unworldly joy when a taint free monk looks upon his mind that is freed of greed freed of hatred freed of delusion then there arises joy this called a still greater unworldly joy now o monks what is worldly happiness there are these five cords of sense desire forms cognizable by the eye sounds cognizable by the ear odors cognizable by the nose flavors cognizable by the tongue tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for and desired agreeable and endearing associated with sense desire and alluring it is the happiness and gladness that arises dependent on these five cords of sense desire which are called worldly happiness now what is unworldly happiness quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unwholesome states of mind a monk enters upon and abides in the and what is the still greater unworldly happiness when a taint free monk looks upon his mind that is freed of greed freed of hatred freed of delusion then there arises happiness this is called a still greater unworldly happiness now what is unworldy equanimity with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of gladness and sadness a monk enters upon and abides in the and what is the still greater unworldly equanimity when a taint free monk looks upon his mind that is freed of greed freed of hatred and freed of delusion then there arises equanimity this is called a still greater unworldly equanimity now o monks what is worldly freedom the freedom connected with the material what is unworldly freedom the freedom connected with the immaterial and what is the still greater unworldly freedom when a taint free monk looks upon his mind that is freed of greed freed of hatred and freed of delusion then there arises freedom then now when a person takes life then with the taking of life as a requisite condition he produces fear animosity in the here now produces fear animosity in future lives experiences mental concomitants of pain despair but when he refrains from taking life he neither produces fear animosity in the here now nor does he produce fear animosity in future lives nor does he experience mental concomitants of pain despair for one who refrains from taking life that fear animosity is thus stilled when a person steals engages in illicit sex tells lies when a person drinks distilled fermented drinks that cause heedlessness then with the drinking of distilled fermented drinks that cause heedlessness as a requisite condition he produces fear animosity in the here now produces fear animosity in future lives experiences mental concomitants of pain despair but when he refrains from drinking distilled fermented drinks that cause heedlessness he neither produces fear animosity in the here now nor does he produce fear animosity in future lives nor does he experience mental concomitants of pain despair for one who refrains from drinking distilled fermented drinks that cause heedlessness that fear animosity is thus stilled these are the five forms of fear animosity that are stilled there is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the awakened one indeed the blessed one is worthy rightly self awakened consummate in knowledge conduct well gone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the teacher of divine human beings awakened blessed he is endowed with verified confidence in the dhamma the dhamma is well expounded by the blessed one to be seen here now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselves he is endowed with verified confidence in the sangha the sangha of the blessed one s disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straight forwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully in other words the four pairs the eight individuals he is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones untorn unbroken unspotted unsplattered liberating praised by the wise untarnished leading to concentration these are the four factors of stream entry with which he is endowed and which is the noble method that he has rightly seen rightly ferreted out through discernment there is the case where a disciple of the noble ones notices when this is that is from the arising of this comes the arising of that when this isn t that isn t from the cessation of this comes the cessation of that in other words from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications from fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name form from name form as a requisite condition come the six sense media from the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact from contact as a requisite condition comes feeling from feeling as a requisite condition comes craving from craving as a requisite condition comes clinging sustenance from clinging sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth from birth as a requisite condition then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair come into play such is the origination of this entire mass of stress suffering now from the remainderless fading cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications from the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness from the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name form from the cessation of name form comes the cessation of the six sense media from the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact from the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling from the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving from the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging sustenance from the cessation of clinging sustenance comes the cessation of becoming from the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth from the cessation of birth then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair all cease such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress suffering this is the noble method that he has rightly seen rightly ferreted out through discernment when for a disciple of the noble ones these five forms of fear animosity are stilled when he is endowed with these four factors of stream entry and when through discernment he has rightly seen rightly ferreted out this noble method then if he wants he may state about himself hell is ended animal wombs are ended the state of the hungry shades is ended states of deprivation destitution the bad bourns are ended i am a stream winner steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for self awakening on one occasion the blessed one was dwelling near the buddha there are cases where some feelings arise based on bile there are cases where some feelings arise based on phlegm based on internal winds based on a combination of bodily humors from the change of the seasons from unevenwhen this was said moliyasivaka the wanderer said to the blessed one bile phlegm wind a combination season uneven harsh treatment and through the result of kamma as the eighth just as monks all the foot characteristics of all jungle creatures and which are those elements that conduce to enlightenment the faculty of faith monks conduces to enlightenment the faculties of energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom conduce to enlightenment just as monks all the foot characteristics of all jungle creatures are combined in the elephant s foot and the elephant s foot is reckoned chief of them in size so too monks of all the elements that conduce to enlightenment the faculty of wisdom is reckoned chief as regards the attainment of enlightenment maybe i ll see nanda once in the forest dressed in rags living just from cast off scraps after that the venerable nanda became a forest dweller going for alms in ragged robes dwelling aloof from sense desires i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said and which seven are the conditions that lead to no decline as long as the monks meet often meet a great deal their growth can be expected not their decline as long as the monks meet in harmony adjourn from their meetings in harmony and conduct sangha business in harmony their growth can be expected not their decline as long as the monks neither decree what has been undecreed nor repeal what has been decreed but practice undertaking the training rules as they have been decreed their growth can be expected not their decline as long as the monks honor respect venerate and do homage to the elder monks those with seniority who have long been ordained the fathers of the sangha leaders of the sangha regarding them as worth listening to their growth can be expected not their decline as long as the monks do not submit to the power of any arisen craving that leads to further becoming their growth can be expected not their decline as long as the monks see their own benefit in wilderness dwellings their growth can be expected not their decline as long as the monks each keep firmly in mind if there are any well behaved fellow followers of the chaste life who have yet to come may they come and may the well behaved fellow followers of the chaste life who have come live in comfort their growth can be expected not their decline as long as the monks remain steadfast in these seven conditions and as long as these seven conditions endure among the monks the monks growth can be expected not their decline monks these four types of individuals are to be found existing in the world which four there is the case where a monk enters remains in a certain peaceful awareness release now there is the case where a monk enters remains in a certain peaceful awareness release he attends to the cessation of self identification and as he is attending to the cessation of self identification his mind leaps up grows confident steadfast firm in the cessation of self identification for him the cessation of self identification is to be expected just as if a man were to grasp a branch with a clean hand his hand would not stick to it grip it or adhere to it in the same way the monk enters remains in a certain peaceful awareness release he attends to the cessation of self identification and as he is attending to the cessation of self identification his mind leaps up grows confident steadfast firm in the cessation of self identification for him the cessation of self identification is to be expected now there is the case where a monk enters remains in a certain peaceful awareness release he attends to the breaching of ignorance but as he is attending to the breaching of ignorance his mind doesn t leap up grow confident steadfast or firm in the breaching of ignorance for him the breaching of ignorance is not to be expected now there is the case where a monk enters remains in a certain peaceful awareness release he attends to the breaching of ignorance and as he is attending to the breaching of ignorance his mind leaps up grows confident steadfast firm in the breaching of ignorance for him the breaching of ignorance is to be expected just as if there were a waste water pool that had stood for countless years where a man were to open all the inlets and block all the outlets and the sky were to rain down in good streams of rain the breaching of the waste water pool s embankment would be expected in the same way the monk enters remains in a certain peaceful awareness release he attends to the breaching of ignorance and as he is attending to the breaching of ignorance his mind leaps up grows confident steadfast firm in the breaching of ignorance for him the breaching of ignorance is to be expected these are four types of individuals to be found existing in the world contents i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the having responded as you say sire the man went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to him king pasenadi kosala lord shows reverence with his head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness affliction are carefree strong living in comfort and then he said lord today king pasenadi kosala will come to see the blessed one after his morning meal now the sisters then after his morning meal king pasenadi kosala went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one the sisters soma and sakula lord show reverence with their heads to your feet and ask whether you are free from illness affliction are carefree strong living in comfort but great king couldn t the sisters soma and sakula get another messenger lord the sisters soma and sakula heard today they say king pasenadi kosala will go to see the blessed one after his morning meal so they approached me while my meal was being served and on arrival said to me in that case great king show reverence with your head to his feet in our name too and ask whether he is free from illness affliction is carefree strong living in comfort saying the sisters soma and sakula lord show reverence with their heads to your feet and ask whether you are free from illness affliction are carefree strong living in comfort lord the sisters soma and sakula show reverence with their heads to your feet and ask whether you are free from illness affliction are carefree strong living in comfort may the sisters soma and sakula be happy great king then king pasenadi kosala said to the blessed one lord i have heard that gotama the contemplative says this it is not possible that a brahman or contemplative would claim a knowledge and vision that is all knowing and all seeing without exception those who say this are they speaking in line with what the blessed one has said are they not misrepresenting the blessed one with what is unfactual are they answering in line with the dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the dhamma would have grounds for criticizing them great king those who say that are not speaking in line with what i have said and are misrepresenting me with what is untrue and unfactual then king pasenadi kosala turned to so king pasenadi turned to one of his men come my good man summon sa jaya the brahman of the akasa clan saying king pasenadi kosala summons you responding as you say sire the man went to sa jaya the brahman of the akasa clan and on arrival said to him king pasenadi kosala summons you then king pasenadi kosala said to the blessed one could it be that something was said by the blessed one in reference to something else which a person could have misunderstood in what way does the blessed one recall having said such a statement great king i recall having said it is not possible that a brahman or contemplative could know everything and see everything all at once what the blessed one says lord seems reasonable what the blessed one says seems logical it is not possible that a brahman or contemplative could know everything and see everything all at once lord there are these four castes noble warriors brahmans brahmans merchants workers is there any distinction or difference among them great king of these four castes two noble warriors brahmans are held to be foremost in terms of receiving homage hospitality salutation polite services i m not asking about the present life lord i m asking about the future life is there any distinction or difference among these four castes great king there are these there is the case where a monk has conviction is convinced of the tathagata s awakening indeed the blessed one is worthy and rightly self awakened consummate in knowledge conduct well gone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the teacher of divine human beings awakened blessed he is free from illness discomfort endowed with good digestion not too cold not too hot of moderate strength fit for exertion he is neither fraudulent nor deceitful he declares himself to the teacher or to his wise friends in the holy life in line with what he actually is he keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities he is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities he is discerning endowed with discernment leading to the arising of the goal noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress these are the five factors for exertion as for the four castes great king if they were endowed with these five factors for exertion that would be for their long term welfare happiness lord if these four castes were endowed with these five factors for exertion would there be any distinction or difference among them in that respect i tell you great king the difference among them would lie in the diversity of their exertion yes lord and would the two tamable elephants tamable horses or tamable oxen that were untamed untrained acquire the habits of the tamed and reach the status of the tamed no lord in the same way great king it is impossible that what could be attained by one who has confidence who is free from illness who is neither fraudulent nor deceitful whose persistence is aroused and who is discerning could also be attained by one who is without conviction who is sickly fraudulent deceitful lazy and dull what the blessed one says lord seems reasonable what the blessed one says seems logical but with regard to these four castes if they were endowed with these five factors for exertion and they had right exertion would there be any distinction or difference among them in that respect i tell you great king that there would be no difference among them with regard to the release of one and the release of another no lord in the same way great king in the power that is kindled by persistence and generated by exertion i say that there is no difference with regard to the release of one and the release of another what the blessed one says lord seems reasonable what the blessed one says seems logical but lord are there devas but why do you ask but lord are there devas whether the devas come back to this life lord or whether they don t those devas who are afflicted when this was said general vidudabha said to the blessed one lord can the afflicted devas oust or expel the unafflicted devas from that place then the thought occurred to sir through the extent of land conquered by king pasenadi kosala where he exercises sovereign independent kingship he and what do you think general through the extent of land sir through the extent of land not conquered by king pasenadi kosala where he does not exercise sovereign independent kingship he is and what do you think general have you heard of the devas of the thirty three yes sir i have heard of the devas of the thirty three as has king pasenadi kosala and what do you think general could king pasenadi kosala oust or expel the devas of the thirty three from that place sir king pasenadi kosala can t even see the devas of the thirty three how could he oust or expel them from that place in the same way general afflicted devas who will come back to this life can t even see the unafflicted devas who don t come back to this life how could they oust or expel them from that place then king pasenadi kosala said to the blessed one lord what is the name of this monk his name is ananda joy great king what a joy he is what a true joy but lord are there brahmas but why do you ask but lord are there brahmas whether the brahmas come back to this life lord or whether they don t those brahmas who are afflicted come back to this life whereas those brahmas who are unafflicted don t come back to this life then a man said to king pasenadi kosala great king sa jaya the brahman of the akasa clan has come then king pasenadi kosala said to sa jaya the brahman of the akasa clan who brought that topic into the royal palace general vidudabha great king general vidudabha said sa jaya the brahman of the akasa clan great king then a man said to king pasenadi kosala time to go great king so king pasenadi kosala said to the blessed one lord we have asked the blessed one about omniscience the blessed one has answered about omniscience and that is pleasing agreeable to us and we are gratified because of it we have asked the blessed one about the purity of the four castes the blessed one has answered about the purity of the four castes and that is pleasing agreeable to us and we are gratified because of it we have asked the blessed one about the higher devas the blessed one has answered about the higher devas and that is pleasing agreeable to us and we are gratified because of it we have asked the blessed one about the higher brahmas the blessed one has answered about the higher brahmas and that is pleasing agreeable to us and we are gratified because of it whatever we have asked the blessed one about that he has answered and that is pleasing agreeable to us and we are gratified because of it now lord we must go many are our duties many our responsibilities then do great king what you think it is now time to do then king pasenadi kosala delighting in and approving of the blessed one s words got up from his seat bowed down to the blessed one and keeping him to his right departed i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near then householder the blessed one has spoken of three feelings a feeling of pleasure a feeling of pain a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain these are the three feelings the blessed one has spoken of when this was said pa cakanga the carpenter said to ven udayin the blessed one has not spoken of three feelings he has spoken of two feelings a feeling of pleasure and a feeling of pain as for the feeling of neither pleasure nor pain the blessed one has spoken of it as a refined pleasure a second time ven udayin said to pa cakanga the carpenter householder the blessed one has not spoken of two feelings he has spoken of three feelings a second time pa cakanga the carpenter said to ven udayin the blessed one has not spoken of three feelings he has spoken of two feelings a third time ven udayin said to pa cakanga the carpenter householder the blessed one has not spoken of two feelings he has spoken of three feelings a third time pa cakanga the carpenter said to ven udayin the blessed one has not spoken of three feelings he has spoken of two feelings neither was ven udayin able to convince pa cakanga the carpenter nor was pa cakanga the carpenter able to convince ven udayin now the blessed one said ananda true was the exposition that pa cakanga the carpenter would not accept from ven udayin and true was the exposition that ven udayin would not accept from pa cakanga the carpenter there is the exposition by which i have spoken of two feelings the exposition by which i have spoken of three feelings five feelings six feelings eighteen feelings feelings feelings and what ananda is another pleasure more extreme refined than that there is the case where a monk quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation this is another pleasure more extreme refined than that though some might say that is the highest pleasure that beings experience i would not grant them that why is that because there is another pleasure more extreme refined than that and what ananda is another pleasure more extreme refined than that there is the case where a monk with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance this is another pleasure more extreme refined than that though some might say that is the highest pleasure that beings experience i would not grant them that why is that because there is another pleasure more extreme refined than that and what ananda is another pleasure more extreme refined than that there is the case where a monk with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding this is another pleasure more extreme refined than that though some might say that is the highest pleasure that beings experience i would not grant them that why is that because there is another pleasure more extreme refined than that and what ananda is another pleasure more extreme refined than that there is the case where a monk with the abandoning of pleasure stress as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain this is another pleasure more extreme refined than that though some might say that is the highest pleasure that beings experience i would not grant them that why is that because there is another pleasure more extreme refined than that and what ananda is another pleasure more extreme refined than that there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving infinite space enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space this is another pleasure more extreme refined than that though some might say that is the highest pleasure that beings experience i would not grant them that why is that because there is another pleasure more extreme refined than that and what ananda is another pleasure more extreme refined than that there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space perceiving infinite

experience i would not grant them that why is that because there is another pleasure more extreme refined than that and what ananda is another pleasure more extreme refined than that there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness perceiving there is nothing enters remains in the dimension of nothingness this is another pleasure more extreme refined than that though some might say that is the highest pleasure that beings experience i would not grant them that why is that because there is another pleasure more extreme refined than that and what ananda is another pleasure more extreme refined than that there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness enters remains in the dimension of

transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception enters remains in the cessation of perception feeling this is another pleasure more extreme refined than that now it s possible ananda that some wanderers of other persuasions might say gotama the contemplative speaks of the cessation of perception feeling and yet describes it as pleasure what is this how can this be when they say that they are to be told it s not the case friends that the blessed one describes only pleasant feeling as included under pleasure wherever pleasure is found in whatever terms the blessed one describes it as pleasure that is what the blessed one said gratified ven ananda delighted in the blessed one s words monks this recitation of more than training rules comes every fortnight in reference to which sons of good families desiring the goal train themselves there is the case where a monk is wholly accomplished in virtue moderately accomplished in concentration and moderately accomplished in discernment with reference to the lesser and minor training rules he falls into offenses and rehabilitates himself why is that because i have not declared that to be a disqualification in these circumstances but as for the training rules that are basic to the holy life and proper to the holy life he is one of permanent virtue one of steadfast virtue having undertaken them he trains in reference to the training rules with the wasting away of the first three fetters he is one who has seven more times at most having transmigrated and wandered on among devas and human beings he will put an end to stress or he is one going from good family to good family i e rebirth in the human realm or any of the deva realms having transmigrated and wandered on among two or three good families he will put an end to stress or he is one with one seed having arisen only once more in the human realm he will put an end to stress or with the wasting away of the first three fetters and with the attenuation of passion aversion delusion he is a once returner who on returning only once more to this world will put an end to stress there is the case where a monk is wholly accomplished in virtue wholly accomplished in concentration and moderately accomplished in discernment with reference to the lesser and minor training rules he falls into offenses and rehabilitates himself why is that because i have not declared that to be a disqualification in these circumstances but as for the training rules that are basic to the holy life and proper to the holy life he is one of permanent virtue one of steadfast virtue having undertaken them he trains in reference to the training rules with the wasting away of the five lower fetters he is one going upstream to the peerless the akani ha heaven the highest of the pure abodes or with the wasting away of the five lower fetters he is one unbound with fabrication of exertion or with the wasting away of the five lower fetters he is one unbound without fabrication of exertion or with the wasting away of the five lower fetters he is one unbound on arrival in a pure abode or with the wasting away of the five lower fetters he is one unbound in between there is the case where a monk is wholly accomplished in virtue wholly accomplished in concentration wholly accomplished in discernment with reference to the lesser and minor training rules he falls into offenses and rehabilitates himself why is that because i have not declared that to be a disqualification in these circumstances but as for the training rules that are basic to the holy life and proper to the holy life he is one of permanent virtue one of steadfast virtue having undertaken them he trains in reference to the training rules with the ending of effluents he dwells in the effluent free awareness release and discernment release having directly known and realized them for himself right in the here and now those who are partially accomplished attain a part those who are wholly accomplished the whole the training rules i tell you are not in vain monks concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing when developed pursued is of great fruit of great benefit and how is concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing developed pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefit there is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore breathing in long he discerns i am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns i am breathing out long or breathing in short he discerns i am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns i am breathing out short he trains himself i will breathe in sensitive to the entire body he trains himself i will breathe in sensitive to rapture he trains himself i will breathe out sensitive to rapture he trains himself i will breathe in sensitive to pleasure he trains himself i will breathe out sensitive to pleasure he trains himself i will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication he trains himself i will breathe in sensitive to the mind he trains himself i will breathe out sensitive to the mind he trains himself i will breathe in gladdening the mind he trains himself i will breathe out gladdening the mind he trains himself i will breathe in steadying the mind he trains himself i will breathe out steadying the mind he trains himself i will breathe in releasing the mind he trains himself i will breathe out releasing the mind he trains himself i will breathe in focusing on inconstancy he trains himself i will breathe out focusing on inconstancy he trains himself i will breathe in focusing on dispassion this is how concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing is developed pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefit i too monks before my awakening when i was an unawakened bodhisatta frequently remained with this abiding when i frequently remained with this abiding neither my body was fatigued nor were my eyes and my mind through lack of clinging sustenance was released from fermentations so if a monk should wish may neither my body be fatigued nor my eyes and may my mind through lack of clinging sustenance be released from fermentations then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing if a monk should wish may my memories resolves related to the household life be abandoned then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing if a monk should wish may i remain percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing if a monk should wish may i remain percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing if a monk should wish may i remain percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome what is then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing if a monk should wish may i remain percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome what is not then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing if a monk should wish may i in the presence of what is loathsome what is not cutting myself off from both remain equanimous mindful alert then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing if a monk should wish may i quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities enter remain in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought evaluation then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing if a monk should wish may i with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations enter remain in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing if a monk should wish may i with the fading of rapture remain equanimous mindful alert sense pleasure with the body and enter remain in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding then he should attend closely to this very same concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing if a monk should wish may i with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress enter remain in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain then he should attend closely to this very same concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing if a monk should wish may i with the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving infinite space enter remain in the dimension of the infinitude of space then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing if a monk should wish may i with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space perceiving infinite consciousness enter remain in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing if a monk should wish may i with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness perceiving there is nothing enter remain in the dimension of nothingness then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing if a monk should wish may i with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness enter remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non perception then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing if a monk should wish may i with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception enter remain in the cessation of perception feeling then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing when concentration through mindfulness of in out breathing is thus developed thus pursued then if he senses a feeling of pleasure he discerns that it is inconstant not grasped at not relished if he senses a feeling of pain he discerns that it is inconstant not grasped at not relished if he senses a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain he discerns that it is inconstant not grasped at not relished if he senses a feeling of pleasure he senses it disjoined from it if he senses a feeling of pain he senses it disjoined from it if he senses a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain he senses it disjoined from it when sensing a feeling limited to the body he discerns that i am sensing a feeling limited to the body when sensing a feeling limited to life he discerns that i am sensing a feeling limited to life he discerns that with the break up of the body after the termination of life everything that is experienced not being relished will grow cold right here then a certain brahman approached the blessed one having approached the blessed one he exchanged friendly greetings after pleasant conversation had passed between them he sat to one side having sat to one side the brahman spoke to the blessed one thus what does the venerable gotama assert what does he preach i am one who asserts that which ought to be done brahman and one who asserts that which ought not to be done but in what way is the venerable gotama one who asserts that which ought to be done and one who asserts that which ought not to be done i say that which ought not to be done brahman of wrong doing by body wrong doing by speech wrong doing by the thinking mind of manifold evil and unwholesome thoughts i say that which ought not to be done i say that which ought to be done brahman of doing good by body doing good by speech doing good by the thinking mind of manifold wholesome thoughts i say that which ought to be done in this way brahman i am one who preaches that which ought to be done and one who preaches that which ought not to be done superb venerable gotama superb venerable gotama venerable gotama has made the dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been turned upside down revealing what had been concealed showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark those who have eyes see forms just so the venerable gotama has illuminated the dhamma in various ways i go to venerable gotama as refuge and to the dhamma and to the assembly of monks from this day for as long as i am endowed with breath let venerable gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion the blessed one was instructing urging rousing encouraging the monks with dhamma talk concerned with unbinding the monks receptive attentive focusing their entire awareness lending ear listened to the dhamma then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed it s hard to see the unaffected for the truth is not easily seen craving is pierced in one who knows for one who sees there is nothing see also monks i have known two qualities through experience discontent with regard to skillful qualities you too monks should relentlessly exert yourselves thinking gladly would we let the flesh blood in our bodies dry up leaving just the skin tendons bones but if we have not attained what can be reached through human firmness human persistence human striving there will be no relaxing our persistence you too in no long time will reach remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing realizing it for yourselves in the here now thus you should train yourselves we will relentlessly exert ourselves thinking gladly would we let the flesh blood in our bodies dry up leaving just the skin tendons bones but if we have not attained what can be reached through human firmness human persistence human striving there will be no relaxing our persistence that s how you should train yourselves on one occasion ven sariputta and ven maha kotthita were staying near varanasi in the game refuge at isipatana then in the evening ven maha kotthita emerged from his seclusion and went to ven sariputta and exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to ven sariputta now then friend sariputta does the tathagata exist after death that friend has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata exists after death well then friend sariputta does the tathagata not exist after death friend that too has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata does not exist after death then does the tathagata both exist and not exist after death that has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death well then does the tathagata neither exist nor not exist after death that too has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death now friend sariputta when asked if the tathagata exists after death you say that has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata exists after death when asked if the tathagata does not exist after death both exists and does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death you say that too has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death now what is the cause what is the reason why that has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata exists after death is immersed in form the tathagata does not exist after death is immersed in form the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death is immersed in form the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death is immersed in form the tathagata exists after death is immersed in feeling the tathagata exists after death is immersed in perception the tathagata exists after death is immersed in fabrication the tathagata exists after death is immersed in consciousness the tathagata does not exist after death is immersed in consciousness the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death is immersed in consciousness the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death is immersed in consciousness this is the cause this is the reason why that has not been declared by the blessed one this is what should be done by one who is skilled in goodness and who knows the path of peace let them be able and upright straightforward and gentle in speech humble and not conceited contented and easily satisfied unburdened with duties and frugal in their ways peaceful and calm and wise and skillful not proud or demanding in nature let them not do the slightest thing that the wise would later reprove wishing in gladness and in safety may all beings be at ease whatever living beings there may be whether they are weak or strong omitting none the great or the mighty medium short or small the seen and the unseen those living near and far away those born and to be born may all beings be at ease let none deceive another or despise any being in any state let none through anger or ill will wish harm upon another even as a mother protects with her life her child her only child so with a boundless heart should one cherish all living beings radiating kindness over the entire world spreading upwards to the skies and downwards to the depths outwards and unbounded freed from hatred and ill will whether standing or walking seated or lying down free from drowsiness one should sustain this recollection this is said to be the sublime abiding by not holding to fixed views the pure hearted one having clarity of vision being freed from all sense desires is not born again into this world these five are a person of integrity s gifts which five a person of integrity gives a gift with a sense of conviction a person of integrity gives a gift attentively a person of integrity gives a gift in season a person of integrity gives a gift with an empathetic heart a person of integrity gives a gift without adversely affecting himself or others having given a gift with a sense of conviction he wherever the result of that gift ripens is rich with much wealth with many possessions and he is well built handsome extremely inspiring endowed with a lotus like complexion having given a gift attentively he wherever the result of that gift ripens is rich with much wealth with many possessions and his children wives slaves servants and workers listen carefully to him lend him their ears and serve him with understanding hearts having given a gift in season he wherever the result of that gift ripens is rich with much wealth with many possessions and his goals are fulfilled in season having given a gift with an empathetic heart he wherever the result of that gift ripens is rich with much wealth with many possessions and his mind inclines to the enjoyment of the five strings of lavish sensuality having given a gift without adversely affecting himself or others he wherever the result of that gift ripens is rich with much wealth with many possessions and not from anywhere does destruction come to his property whether from fire from water from kings from thieves or from hateful heirs these five are a person of integrity s gifts there are o monks these three feelings rooted in sense impression caused by sense impression conditioned by sense impression pleasant painful and neutral feelings dependent on a sense impression that is liable to be felt as pleasurable there arises a pleasant feeling when that very sense impression liable to be felt as pleasurable has ceased then the sensation born from it dependent on a sense impression that is liable to be felt as painful there arises a painful feeling when that very sense impression liable to be felt as painful has ceased then the sensation born from it namely the painful feeling that arose dependent on that sense impression also ceases and is stilled dependent on a sense impression that is liable to be felt as neutral there arises a neutral feeling when that very sense impression liable to be felt as neutral has ceased then the sensation born from it namely the neutral feeling that arose dependent on that sense impression also ceases and is stilled just as from the coming together and rubbing of two sticks of wood heat results and fire is produced and by the separation and disconnection of the sticks the heat produced by them ceases and disappears so it is also with these three feelings which are born of sense impression rooted in sense impression caused by sense impression dependent on sense impression dependent on a sense impression of a certain kind there arises a corresponding feeling by the cessation of that sense impression the corresponding feeling ceases there are these four types of thunderheads which four one that thunders but doesn t rain one that rains but doesn t thunder one that neither thunders nor rains and one that both thunders and rains these are the four types of thunderheads in the same way these four types of persons resembling thunderheads are to be found existing in the world which four the one that thunders but doesn t rain the one that rains but doesn t thunder the one that neither thunders nor rains and the one that both thunders and rains and how is one the type of person who thunders but doesn t rain there is the case where a person has mastered the dhamma dialogues narratives of mixed prose and verse explanations verses spontaneous exclamations quotations birth stories amazing events question answer sessions and how is one the type of person who rains but doesn t thunder there is the case where a person has not mastered the dhamma dialogues question answer sessions yet he does discern as it actually is present that this is stress he discerns as it actually is present that this is the origination of stress he discerns as it actually is present that this is the cessation of stress he discerns as it actually is present that this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress this is the type of person who rains but doesn t thunder this type of person i tell you is like the thunderhead that rains but doesn t thunder and how is one the type of person who neither thunders nor rains there is the case where a person has not mastered the dhamma dialogues question answer sessions he doesn t discern as it actually is present that this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress this is the type of person who neither thunders nor rains this type of person i tell you is like the thunderhead that neither thunders nor rains and how is one the type of person who both thunders and rains there is the case where a person has mastered the dhamma dialogues question answer sessions he discerns as it actually is present that this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress this is the type of person who both thunders and rains this type of person i tell you is like the thunderhead that both thunders and rains there are these four types of people to be found existing in the world i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near now at that time responding as you say friends to his own following susima the wanderer went to ven ananda and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to ven ananda friend ananda i want to live the holy life in this dhamma discipline then now at that time a large number of monks had declared final gnosis in the blessed one s presence we discern that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for the sake of this world ven susima heard that a large number of monks it seems have declared final gnosis in the blessed one s presence we discern that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for the sake of this world then ven susima went to those monks and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with them after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to them is it true as they say that you have declared final gnosis in the blessed one s presence we discern that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for the sake of this world yes friend then having known thus having seen thus do you wield manifold supranormal powers having been one you become many having been many you become one you appear you vanish you go unimpeded through walls ramparts mountains as if through space you dive in out of the earth as if it were water you walk on water without sinking as if it were dry land sitting crosslegged you fly through the air like a winged bird with your hand you touch and stroke even the sun moon so mighty powerful you exercise influence with your body even as far as the brahma worlds no friend then having known thus having seen thus do you hear by means of the divine ear element purified surpassing the human both kinds of sounds divine human whether near or far no friend then having known thus having seen thus do you know the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with your own awareness do you discern a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passion a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion a restricted mind as a restricted mind and a scattered mind as a scattered mind an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mind an excelled mind one that is not on the most excellent level as an excelled mind and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind a released mind as a released mind and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind no friend then having known thus having seen thus do you recollect your manifold past lives lit previous homes i e one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand births many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction expansion recollecting there i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose there there too i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose here no friend then having known thus having seen thus do you see by means of the divine eye purified surpassing the human beings passing away and re appearing and do you discern how they are inferior superior beautiful ugly fortunate unfortunate in accordance with their kamma these beings who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell but these beings who were endowed with good conduct of body speech mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world no friend then having known thus having seen thus do you dwell touching with your body the peaceful emancipations the formless states beyond form the formless jhanas no friend so just now friends didn t you make that declaration without having attained any of these dhammas we re released through discernment friend susima i don t understand the detailed meaning of your brief statement it would be good if you would speak in such a way that i would understand its detailed meaning whether or not you understand friend susima we are still released through discernment so ven susima got up from his seat and went to the blessed one on arrival having bowed down to the blessed one he sat to one side as he was sitting there he told the blessed one the entire conversation he had had with those monks the blessed one said first susima there is the knowledge of the regularity of the dhamma dependent co arising after which there is the knowledge of unbinding i don t understand the detailed meaning of the blessed one s brief statement it would be good if the blessed one would speak in such a way that i would understand its detailed meaning whether or not you understand susima it is still the case that first there is the knowledge of the regularity of the dhamma after which there is the knowledge of unbinding what do you think susima is form any physical phenomenon constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord is feeling constant or inconstant inconstant lord is perception constant or inconstant inconstant lord are fabrications constant or inconstant inconstant lord what do you think susima is consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord thus susima any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am any feeling whatsoever any perception whatsoever any fabrications whatsoever any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am seeing thus the well instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness disenchanted he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is fully released with full release there is the knowledge fully released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world susima do you see that from birth as a requisite condition there is aging death yes lord do you see that from becoming as a requisite condition there is birth yes lord do you see that from clinging sustenance as a requisite condition there is becoming yes lord do you see that from craving as a requisite condition there is clinging sustenance yes lord do you see that from feeling as a requisite condition there is craving yes lord do you see that from contact as a requisite condition there is feeling yes lord do you see that from the six sense media as a requisite condition there is contact yes lord do you see that from name form as a requisite condition there are the six sense media yes lord do you see that from consciousness as a requisite condition there is name form yes lord do you see that from fabrications as a requisite condition there is consciousness yes lord do you see that from ignorance as a requisite condition there are fabrications yes lord now susima do you see that from the cessation of birth there is the cessation of aging death yes lord do you see that from the cessation of becoming there is the cessation of birth yes lord do you see that from the cessation of clinging sustenance there is the cessation of becoming yes lord do you see that from the cessation of craving there is the cessation of clinging sustenance yes lord do you see that from the cessation of feeling there is the cessation of craving yes lord do you see that from the cessation of contact there is the cessation of feeling yes lord do you see that from the cessation of the six sense media there is the cessation of contact yes lord do you see that from the cessation of name form there is the cessation of the six sense media yes lord do you see that from the cessation of consciousness there is the cessation of name form yes lord do you see that from the cessation of fabrications there is the cessation of consciousness yes lord do you see that from the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of fabrications yes lord then having known thus having seen thus susima do you wield manifold supranormal powers having been one you become many having been many you become one you appear you vanish you go unimpeded through walls ramparts mountains as if through space you dive in out of the earth as if it were water you walk on water without sinking as if it were dry land sitting crosslegged you fly through the air like a winged bird with your hand you touch and stroke even the sun moon so mighty powerful you exercise influence with your body even as far as the brahma worlds no lord then having known thus having seen thus susima do you hear by means of the divine ear element purified surpassing the human both kinds of sounds divine human whether near or far no lord then having known thus having seen thus susima do you know the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with your own awareness do you discern a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passion a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion a restricted mind as a restricted mind and a scattered mind as a scattered mind an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mind an excelled mind one that is not on the most excellent level as an

forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand births many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction expansion recollecting there i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose there there too i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose here no lord then having known thus having seen thus susima do you see by means of the divine eye purified surpassing the human beings passing away and re appearing and do you discern how they are inferior superior beautiful ugly fortunate unfortunate in accordance with their kamma these beings who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell but these beings who were endowed with good conduct of body speech mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world no lord then having known thus having seen thus susima do you dwell touching with your body the peaceful emancipations the formless states beyond form no lord so just now susima didn t you make that declaration without having attained any of these dhammas then throwing himself down with his head at the blessed one s feet ven susima said to the blessed one a transgression has overcome me lord in that i was so foolish so muddle headed so unskilled as to go forth as a thief of the dhamma in this well taught dhamma discipline may the blessed one please accept this confession of my transgression as such so that i may restrain myself in the future yes susima a transgression overcame you in that you were so foolish so muddle headed so unskilled as to go forth as a thief of the dhamma in this well taught dhamma discipline suppose susima that a robber an evil doer having been caught were shown to a king this your majesty is a robber an evil doer decree what punishment you want for him and so the king would say go and having bound him with a stout rope with his arms pinned tightly against his back having shaved him bald march him to a harsh sounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evict him out the south gate of the city and there to the south of the city cut off his head then the king s men having bound the man with a stout rope with his arms pinned tightly against his back would march him to a harsh sounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evict him out the south gate of the city and there to the south of the city cut off his head what do you think susima wouldn t that man for that reason experience pain distress yes lord however much the pain distress that man would experience for that reason susima the going forth of a thief of the dhamma in this well taught dhamma discipline is still more painful in its result more bitter in its result in that it leads even to the lower realms but because you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the dhamma we accept your confession for susima it is a cause of growth in the dhamma discipline of the noble ones when seeing a transgression as such one makes amends in accordance with the dhamma and exercises restraint in the future on one occasion very good venerable sir and delighting in and approving of ven

verbal fabrications perceptions feelings are mental these are things tied up with the mind that s why perceptions feelings are mental fabrications very good venerable sir and delighting in and approving of ven kamabhu s answer citta asked him a further question now how does the attainment of the cessation of perception feeling come about the thought does not occur to a monk as he is attaining the cessation of perception feeling that i am about to attain the cessation of perception feeling or that i am attaining the cessation of perception feeling or that i have attained the cessation of perception feeling instead the way his mind has previously been developed leads him to that state very good venerable sir and delighting in and approving of ven kamabhu s answer citta asked him a further question when a monk is attaining the cessation of perception feeling which things cease first bodily fabrications verbal fabrications or mental fabrications when a monk is attaining the cessation of perception feeling verbal fabrications cease first then bodily fabrications then mental fabrications very good venerable sir and delighting in and approving of ven kamabhu s answer citta asked him a further question what is the difference between a monk who has died passed away and a monk who has attained the cessation of perception feeling in the case of a monk who has died passed away his bodily fabrication has ceased subsided verbal fabrication has ceased subsided mental fabrication has ceased subsided his life force is totally ended his heat is dissipated and his faculties are shut down but in the case of a monk who has attained the cessation of perception feeling his bodily fabrication has ceased subsided verbal fabrication has ceased subsided mental fabrication has ceased subsided his life force is not ended his heat is not dissipated and his faculties are bright clear this is the difference between a monk who has died passed away and a monk who

cessation of perception feeling come about the thought does not occur to a monk as he is emerging from the cessation of perception feeling that i am about to emerge from the cessation of perception feeling or that i am emerging from the cessation of perception feeling or that i have emerged from the cessation of perception feeling instead the way his mind has previously been developed leads him to that state very good venerable sir and delighting in and approving of ven kamabhu s answer citta asked him a further question when a monk is emerging from the cessation of perception feeling which things arise first bodily fabrications verbal fabrications or mental fabrications when a monk is emerging from the cessation of perception feeling mental fabrications arise first then bodily fabrications then verbal fabrications very good venerable sir and delighting in and approving of ven kamabhu s answer citta asked him a further question when a monk has emerged from the cessation of

with the undirected very good venerable sir and delighting in and approving of ven kamabhu s answer citta asked him a further question when a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception feeling to what does his mind lean to what does it tend to what does it incline when a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception feeling his mind leans to seclusion tends to seclusion inclines to seclusion very good venerable sir and delighting in and approving of ven kamabhu s answer citta asked him a further question how many mental qualities are of great help in the attainment of the cessation of perception feeling actually householder you have asked last what should have been asked first nevertheless i will answer you two qualities are of great help in the attainment of the cessation of perception feeling tranquillity insight monks i will teach you about new kamma and old kamma about the ceasing of kamma and the path that leads to the ceasing of kamma listen well pay close attention and i will speak what monks is old kamma the eye and what monks is new kamma the action when monks by ceasing actions of body speech and mind one touches liberation and what monks is the path that leads to the ceasing of kamma it is the noble eightfold path namely right view right thought right speech right action whatever monks a teacher ought to do out of compassion for the profit of his disciples that i have done having compassion for you here monks are the roots of trees here are lonely places meditate monks do not be slothful have no subsequent regrets thus we charge you at just now lord i was engaged in the sort of royal affairs typical of head anointed noble warrior kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures who have attained stable control in their country and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory on earth what do you think great king suppose a man trustworthy and reliable were to come to you from the east and on arrival would say if it please your majesty you should know that i come from the east there i saw a great mountain as high as the clouds coming this way crushing all living beings in its path do whatever you think should be done then a second man were to come to you from the west then a third man were to come to you from the north then a fourth man were to come to you from the south and on arrival would say if it please your majesty you should know that i come from the south there i saw a great mountain as high as the clouds coming this way crushing all living beings do whatever you think should be done if great king such a great peril should arise such a terrible destruction of human life the human state being so hard to obtain what should be done if lord such a great peril should arise such a terrible destruction of human life the human state being so hard to obtain what else should be done but dhamma conduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deeds i inform you great king i announce to you great king aging and death are rolling in on you when aging and death are rolling in on you great king what should be done as aging and death are rolling in on me lord what else should be done but dhamma conduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deeds there are lord elephant battles fought by head anointed noble warrior kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures who have attained stable control in their country and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory on earth but there is no use for those elephant battles no scope for them when aging and death are rolling in there are cavalry battles chariot battles infantry battles but there is no use for those infantry battles no scope for them when aging and death are rolling in in this royal court there are counselors who when the enemies arrive are capable of dividing them by their wits but there is no use for those battles of wits no scope for them when aging and death are rolling in in this royal court there is abundant bullion and gold stored in vaults and depositories and with such wealth we are capable of buying off enemies when they come but there is no use for those battles of wealth no scope for them when aging and death are rolling in as aging and death are rolling in on me lord what else should be done but dhamma conduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deeds so it is great king so it is great king as aging and death are rolling in on you what else should be done but dhamma conduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deeds that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher further said this like massivethus have i heard once the venerable mahaa kassapa and the venerable saariputta were staying near benares at isipatana in the deer park when friend a monk thinks evil thus it is friend that without ardor without taking care one is unable to gain enlightenment unable to gain nibbaana unable to gain relief from bondage and how friend is one ardent when a monk thinks evil and unskilled states skilled states develop concentration monks a concentrated monk discerns things as they actually are present and what does he discern as it actually is present he discerns as it actually is present that the eye is inconstant forms are inconstant eye consciousness is inconstant eye contact is inconstant whatever arises in dependence on eye contact experienced either as pleasure as pain or as neither pleasure nor pain that too is inconstant he discerns as it actually is present that the ear is inconstant the nose is inconstant the tongue is inconstant the body is inconstant he discerns as it actually is present that the intellect is inconstant ideas are inconstant intellect consciousness is inconstant intellect contact is inconstant whatever arises in dependence on intellect contact experienced either as pleasure as pain or as neither pleasure nor pain that too is inconstant so develop concentration monks a concentrated monk discerns things as they actually are present monks there are these six rewards in realizing the

it is to this extent that one is described by the blessed one as released both ways without a sequel when o monks an untaught worldling says that in the great ocean there is a bottomless pit who cannot bear the painful body feelings that arise endangering his life he trembles when afflicted he wails and cries aloud a weak and feeble man he cannot stand against the pit nor can a foothold he secure but one who bears the painful body feelings that arise not trembling when his very life is threatened he truly can withstand that pit and gain a foothold in its depth i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near ku iya in the ku i h na forest and on that occasion suppav s the koliyan daughter had been seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor she touched by fierce sharp pains endured them with three thoughts how rightly self awakened is the blessed one who abandoning this sort of suffering teaches the dhamma how well practiced is the community of the blessed one s disciples who practice abandoning this sort of suffering how truly blissful is unbinding where this sort of pain is not found then suppav s said to her husband come young master go to

dhamma how well practiced is the community of the blessed one s disciples who practice abandoning this sort of suffering how truly blissful is unbinding where this sort of pain is not found responding excellent to suppav s the koliyan daughter the koliyan son went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to the blessed one sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one suppav s the koliyan daughter lord shows reverence with her head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness affliction are carefree strong living in comfort and she says this suppav s has been seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor she touched by fierce sharp pains endures them with three thoughts how rightly self awakened is the blessed one who abandoning this sort of suffering teaches the dhamma how well practiced is the community of the blessed one s disciples who practice abandoning this sort of suffering how truly blissful is unbinding where this sort of pain is not found the blessed one said may suppav s the koliyan daughter be well free from disease and may she deliver a son free from disease and at the same time as the blessed one s statement suppav s the koliyan daughter well free from disease delivered a son free from disease saying very well lord the koliyan son delighting in approving of the blessed one s words got up from his seat bowed down to the blessed one and circling him to the right returned to his home he saw that suppav s the koliyan daughter well free from disease had delivered a son free from disease on seeing this the thought occurred to him how amazing how astounding the tath gata s great power great might in that at the same time as the blessed one s statement suppav s the koliyan daughter well free from disease would deliver a son free from disease gratified he was joyful rapturous happy then suppav s said to her husband come young master go to the blessed one and on arrival showing reverence with your head to his feet in my name saying suppav s the koliyan daughter lord shows reverence with her head to your feet and say this suppav s who was seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor has now well free from disease delivered a son free from disease she invites the community of monks with the buddha at its head for seven days of meals may the blessed one acquiesce to suppav s s seven meals together with the community of monks responding excellent to suppav s the koliyan daughter the koliyan son went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to the blessed one sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one suppav s the koliyan daughter lord shows reverence with her head to your feet and she says this suppav s who was seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor has now well free from disease delivered a son free from disease she invites the community of monks with the buddha at its head for seven days of meals may the blessed one acquiesce to suppav s s seven meals together with the community of monks now at that time a certain lay follower had invited the community of monks with the buddha at its head for the next day s meal that lay follower was a supporter of ven mah moggall na so the blessed one addressed ven mah moggall na come moggall na go to the lay follower and on arrival say to him suppav s the koliyan

knowing that suppav s was gratified joyful rapturous happy said to her suppav s would you like to have another son like this o blessed one lord i would like to have seven more sons like this then on

found existing in the world monks there are these four obscurations of the sun and moon obscured by which the sun and moon don t glow don t shine don t dazzle which four clouds are an obscuration of the sun and moon obscured by which the sun and moon don t glow don t shine don t dazzle fog is an obscuration smoke and dust is an obscuration rahu the king of the asuras these are the four

comes a time when the great ocean evaporates dries up does not exist but for beings as long as they are hindered by ignorance fettered by craving transmigrating wandering on i don t say that there is an end of suffering stress there comes a time when there comes a time when the great earth is consumed with flame is destroyed does not exist but for beings as long as they are hindered by ignorance fettered by craving transmigrating wandering on i don t say that there is an end of suffering stress he assumes feeling to be the self he assumes perception to be the self he assumes mental fabrications to be the self he assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness he keeps running around and circling around that very form that very feeling that very perception those very fabrications that very consciousness he is not set loose from form not set loose from feeling from perception from fabrications not set loose from consciousness he is not set loose from birth aging death from sorrows lamentations pains distresses despairs he is not set loose i tell you from suffering stress but a well instructed disciple of the noble ones who has regard for noble ones is well versed disciplined in their dhamma who has regard for people of integrity is well versed disciplined in their dhamma

perception from fabrications set loose from consciousness he is set loose from birth aging death from sorrows lamentations pains distresses despairs he is set loose i tell you from suffering stress i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near r jagaha at the bamboo grove the squirrels refuge and on that occasion early in the morning of the uposatha ven nanda adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl robes went into r jagaha for alms devadatta saw ven nanda going for alms in r jagaha and on seeing him went to him on arrival he said to him from this day forward friend nanda i will conduct the uposatha community transactions apart from the blessed one apart from the community of monks then ven nanda having gone for alms in r jagaha after the meal returning from his alms round went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one just now lord after adjusting my under robe early in the morning and carrying my bowl robes i went into r jagaha for alms devadatta saw me going for alms in r jagaha and on seeing me went up to me on arrival he said to me from this day forward friend nanda i will conduct the uposatha community transactions apart from the blessed one apart from the community of monks lord today devadatta will split the community he will conduct the uposatha community transactions apart from the community then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed the good for the good is easy to do the good for the evil is hard to do evil for the evil is easy to do evil for the noble ones is hard to do on one occasion the blessed one was staying near that is what the blessed one said having said it the one well gone getting up from his seat went into his dwelling then early in the morning a certain monk having put on his robes and carrying his bowl outer robe went to hatthaka of alavi s home on arrival he sat down on a seat made ready then hatthaka of alavi approached the monk and having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there the monk said to him friend the blessed one has described you as being endowed with seven amazing astounding qualities which seven hatthaka of alavi is endowed with conviction he is virtuous he has a sense of conscience he has a sense of concern he is learned he is generous he is discerning friend the blessed one has described you as being endowed with these seven amazing astounding qualities i hope sir that there were no white clad householders there no friend there were no white clad householders there it s good sir that there were no white clad householders there then the monk having received alms at hatthaka of alavi s home departed after his meal returning from his alms round he went to the blessed one on arrival having bowed down to the blessed one he sat to one side as he was sitting there he told the blessed one what had happened the blessed one replied it s good monk it s very good that the clansman is modest and does not want others to know of the skillful qualities present in him in that case monk remember hatthaka of alavi as being endowed with this eighth amazing astounding quality modesty when a person has wrong view wrong resolve wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness wrong concentration wrong knowledge wrong release whatever bodily deeds he undertakes in line with that view whatever verbal deeds whatever mental deeds he undertakes in line with that view whatever intentions whatever determinations whatever vows whatever fabrications all lead to what is disagreeable unpleasing unappealing unprofitable stressful why is that because the view is evil when a person has right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration right knowledge right release whatever bodily deeds he undertakes in line with that view whatever verbal deeds whatever mental deeds he undertakes in line with that view whatever intentions whatever vows whatever determinations whatever fabrications all lead to what is agreeable pleasing charming profitable easeful why is that because the view is auspicious there are these five seasonable gifts which five one gives to a newcomer one gives to one going away one gives to one who is ill one gives in time of famine one sets the first fruits of field orchard in front of those who are virtuous these are the five seasonable gifts in the proper season they give those with discernment responsive free from stinginess having been given in proper season with hearts inspired by the noble ones straightened such their offering bears an abundance those who rejoice in that gift or give assistance they too have a share of the merit and the offering isn t depleted by that so with an unhesitant mind one should give where the gift bears great fruit merit is what establishes living beings in the next life thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living near savatthi at jetavana at anathapindika s monastery at that time suriya the sun deity was seized by rahu lord of asuras thereupon calling to mind the blessed one suriya the sun deity recited this stanza thereupon the blessed one addressed a stanza to rahu lord of asuras on behalf of suriya thus thereupon rahu lord of asuras released suriya and immediately came to the presence of vepacitta lord of asuras and stood beside him trembling with fear and with hair standing on end then vepacitta addressed rahu in this stanza i have been spoken to by the buddha in a stanza requesting me to release suriya if i had not released suriya my head would have split into seven pieces while yet i live i should have had no happiness therefore i released suriya monks if anyone were to say without having broken through to the noble truth of stress as it actually is present without having broken through to the noble truth of the origination of stress the cessation of stress the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress as it actually is present i will bring about the right ending of stress that would be an impossibility just as if someone were to say without having built the lower story of a gabled building i will put up the upper story that would be an impossibility in the same way if anyone were to say without having broken through to the noble truth of stress as it actually is present without having broken through to the noble truth of the origination of stress the cessation of stress the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress as it actually is present i will bring about the right ending of stress that would be an impossibility if anyone were to say having broken through to the noble truth of stress as it actually is present having broken through to the noble truth of the origination of stress the cessation of stress the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress as it actually is present i will bring about the right ending of stress that would be a possibility just as if someone were to say having built the lower story of a gabled building i will put up the upper story that would be a possibility in the same way if anyone were to say having broken through to the noble truth of stress as it actually is present having broken through to the noble truth of the origination of stress the cessation of stress the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress as it actually is present i will bring about the right ending of stress that would be a possibility therefore monks your duty is the contemplation this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress your duty is the contemplation this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress five properties lead to escape which five there is the case where the mind of a monk when attending to sensual pleasures doesn t leap up at sensual pleasures doesn t grow confident steadfast or released in sensual pleasures but when attending to renunciation his mind leaps up at renunciation grows confident steadfast released in renunciation when his mind is rightly gone rightly developed has rightly risen above gained release and become disjoined from sensual pleasures then whatever fermentations torments fevers there are that arise in dependence on sensuality he is released from them he does not experience that feeling this is expounded as the escape from sensual pleasures furthermore there is the case where the mind of a monk when attending to ill will doesn t leap up at ill will doesn t grow confident steadfast or released in ill will but when attending to non ill will his mind leaps up at non ill will grows confident steadfast released in non ill will when his mind is rightly gone rightly developed has rightly risen above gained release and become disjoined from ill will then whatever fermentations torments fevers there are that arise in dependence on ill will he is released from them he does not experience that feeling this is expounded as the escape from ill will furthermore there is the case where the mind of a monk when attending to harmfulness doesn t leap up at harmfulness doesn t grow confident steadfast or released in harmfulness but when attending to harmlessness his mind leaps up at harmlessness grows confident steadfast released in harmlessness when his mind is rightly gone rightly developed has rightly risen above gained release and become disjoined from harmfulness then whatever fermentations torments fevers there are that arise in dependence on harmfulness he is released from them he does not experience that feeling this is expounded as the escape from harmfulness furthermore there is the case where the mind of a monk when attending to forms doesn t leap up at forms doesn t grow confident steadfast or released in forms but when attending to the formless his mind leaps up at the formless grows confident steadfast released in the formless when his mind is rightly gone rightly developed has rightly risen above gained release and become disjoined from forms then whatever fermentations torments fevers there are that arise in dependence on forms he is released from them he does not experience that feeling this is expounded as the escape from forms furthermore there is the case where the mind of a monk when attending to self identity doesn t leap up at self identity doesn t grow confident steadfast or released in self identity but when attending to the cessation of self identity his mind leaps up at the cessation of self identity grows confident steadfast released in the cessation of self identity when his mind is rightly gone rightly developed has rightly risen above gained release and become disjoined from self identity then whatever fermentations torments fevers there are that arise in dependence on self identity he is released from them he does not experience that feeling this is expounded as the escape from self identity delight in sensuality does not obsess him delight in ill will does not obsess him delight in harmfulness does not obsess him delight in form does not obsess him delight in self identity does not obsess him from the lack of any obsession with sensuality the lack of any obsession with ill will to harmfulness to form to self identity he is called a monk without attachment he has cut through craving has turned away from the fetter and by rightly breaking through conceit he has put an end to suffering stress these are the five properties that lead to escape staying at savatthi then a brahman cosmologist everything exists is the senior form of cosmology brahman then master gotama does everything not exist everything does not exist is the second form of cosmology brahman then is everything a oneness everything is a oneness is the third form of cosmology brahman then is everything a manyness now from the remainderless fading cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications from the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness from the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name form from the cessation of name form comes the cessation of the six sense media from the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact from the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling from the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving from the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging sustenance from the cessation of clinging sustenance comes the cessation of becoming from the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth from the cessation of birth then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair all cease such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress suffering i will describe the going forth how he the one with vision went forth how he reasoned and chose the going forth householdrajagahamagadhansking bimbisaratheymount pandavaa lionhimalayaskosalansi have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was living among the i too brahman plow sow having plowed sown i eat but contemplative i don t see the master gotama s yoke or plow plowshare goad or oxen and yet the master gotama says this i too brahman plow sow having plowed sown i eat then the kasi bharadvaja addressed the blessed one with a verse you claim to be a plowman but i don t see your plowing being asked tell us about your plowing so that we may know your plowing then kasi bharadvaja having heaped up milk rice in a large bronze serving bowl offered it to the blessed one saying may master gotama eat this milk rice the master is a plowman for the master gotama plows the plowing that has as its fruit the deathless what s been chanted over with verses shouldn t be eaten by me that s not the nature brahman of one who s seen rightly what s been chanted over with verses awakened ones reject that being their nature brahman this is their way of life serve with other food drink a fully perfected great seer his fermentations ended his anxiety stilled for that is the field for one looking for merit then to whom master gotama should i give this milk rice brahman i don t see that person in this world with its devas maras brahmas in this generation with its royalty common people by whom this milk rice having been eaten would be rightly digested aside from a tathagata or a tathagata s disciple in that case brahman throw the milk rice away in a place without vegetation or dump it in water with no living beings the buddha convictiononce when the buddha was living at savatthi king pasenadi of kosala ate a whole bucketful of food and then approached the buddha engorged and panting and sat down to one side the buddha discerning that king pasenadi was engorged and panting took the occasion to utter this verse when a person is constantly mindful and knows when enough food has been taken all their afflictions become more slender they age more gradually protecting their lives now at that time the brahman youth sudassana was standing nearby and king pasenadi of kosala addressed him come now my dear sudassana and having thoroughly mastered this verse in the presence of the buddha recite it whenever food is brought to me and i will set up for you a permanent offering of a hundred then king pasenadi of kosala gradually settled down to eating no more than a cup full of rice at a later time when his body had become quite slim king pasenadi stroked his limbs with his hand and took the occasion to utter this utterance indeed the buddha has shown me compassion in two different ways for my welfare right here and now and also for in the future just as a fine thoroughbredstaying at savatthi suppose monks that there were a pond fifty leagues wide fifty leagues long fifty leagues deep filled to overflowing with water so that a crow could drink from it and a man would draw some water out of it with the tip of a blade of grass what do you think which would be greater the water drawn out with the tip of the blade of grass or the water in the pond the water in the pond would be far greater lord the water drawn out with the tip of the blade of grass would be next to nothing it wouldn t be a hundredth a thousandth a one hundred thousandth the water drawn out with the tip of the blade of grass when compared with the water in the pond then no my friend then is it the case friend sariputta that the holy life is lived under the blessed one

section on breathingbhikkhus the bhikkhu following the practice of my teaching having gone to the forest or to the foot of a tree or to an empty solitary place sits down cross legged keeping his body erect and sets up mindfulness orienting it then with entire mindfulness he breathes in and with entire mindfulness he breathes out breathing in a long inhalation he is conscious of breathing in a long inhalation or breathing out a long exhalation he is conscious of breathing out a long exhalation breathing in a short inhalation he is conscious of breathing in a short inhalation or breathing out a short exhalation he is conscious of breathing out a short exhalation he trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the in coming breath at its beginning its middle and at its end he trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the out going breath at its beginning its middle and at its end by being fully conscious of the inhalation he trains himself to calm down the strong inhalation as he breathes in by being fully conscious of the exhalation he trains himself to calm down the strong exhalation as he breathes out just as bhikkhus a skilful turner or a turner s apprentice knows a long pullthus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his occasionally he realizes that the aggregate of physical phenomenawhen he gains more concentration he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the aggregate of physical phenomena he also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena he also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena with their causes and further the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there is only the aggregate of physical phenomena end of the section on breathing section on body movement and posturethus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is

keeps his mind steadfastly on the body end of the section on clear comprehension section on consideration of repulsivenessjust as if bhikkhus there were a bag with an opening at each end and full of various kinds of grain such as hill paddy paddy green gram cow pea sesame and husked rice and a man with sound eyes having opened it should examine and reflect on the contents thus this is hill paddy this is paddy this is green gram this is cow pea this is sesame this is husked rice even so bhikkhus the bhikkhu examines and reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet up and from the tips of the hair down enclosed by the skin and full of manifold impurities thinking thus there are in this body hair of the head urine thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body bhikkhus it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body end of the section on consideration of repulsiveness section on consideration of the

the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body bhikkhus it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body and again bhikkhus as if the bhikkhu is seeing a body abandoned in the charnel ground being devoured by crows being devoured by hawks being devoured by vultures being devoured by herons being devoured by dogs being devoured by tigers being devoured by leopards being devoured by jackals or being devoured by various kinds of worms he applies this perception to his own body thus indeed this body of mine too is of the same nature it will become like that it cannot escape such a fate thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body bhikkhus it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body and again bhikkhus as if the bhikkhu is seeing a body abandoned in the charnel ground reduced to a skeleton held together by the tendons with some flesh and blood still adhering to it reduced to a skeleton held together by the tendons blood besmeared fleshless reduced to a skeleton still held together by the tendons without flesh and blood reduced to loose bones

abandoned in the charnel ground reduced to bleached bones of conch like color reduced to bones more than a year old lying in a heap reduced to rotted bones crumbling to dust he then applies this perception to his own body thus indeed this body of mine too is of the same nature it will become like that it cannot escape such a fate thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his occasionally he realizes that the aggregate of physical phenomenawhen he gains more concentration he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the aggregate of physical phenomena he also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena he also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena with their causes and further the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there is only the aggregate of physical phenomena thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his occasionally he realizes that the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body of others must be of a similar nature because of this realization he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena of others in this way he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his own body or which is that of others when he gains more concentration he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the aggregate of physical phenomena he also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena he also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena with their causes and further the bhikkhu is firmly

kamma is the field consciousness the seed and craving the moisture the if there were no kamma ripening in the form property would form becoming be discerned no lord thus kamma is the field consciousness the seed and craving the moisture the intention aspiration of living beings hindered by ignorance fettered by craving is established in tuned to a middling property thus there is the production of renewed becoming in the future if there were no kamma ripening in the formless property would formless becoming be discerned no lord thus kamma is the field consciousness the seed and craving the moisture if one longing for sensual pleasure achieves it yes he s enraptured at heart the mortal gets what he wants but if for that person longing desiring the pleasures diminish he s shattered as ifwhoeverfor painon one occasion the blessed one was staying near it s not the earth property that makes the true dhamma disappear it s not the water property the fire property the wind property that makes the true dhamma disappear these five downward leading qualities tend to the confusion and disappearance of the true dhamma which five there is the case where the monks nuns male lay followers female lay followers live without respect without deference for the teacher they live without respect without deference for the dhamma for the sangha for the training for concentration these are the five downward leading qualities that tend to the confusion and disappearance of the true dhamma but these five qualities tend to the stability the non confusion the non disappearance of the true dhamma which five there is the case where the monks nuns male lay followers female lay followers live with respect with deference for the teacher they live with respect with deference for the dhamma for the sangha for the training for concentration these are the five qualities that tend to the stability the non confusion the non disappearance of the true dhamma thus have i heard at one time the blessed one was staying near raajagaha in the bamboo grove at these words the brahman said to her now then now then every chance she gets this wretched woman has to sing the praises of that shaveling recluse now woman i m going to tell that teacher of yours what i think of him oh brahman i know of nobody in this world with its gods maaras and brahmaas with its recluses and brahmans whether they be divine or human who could thus rebuke the blessed one the arahant the fully self enlightened one but go on brahman go and you will find out then the brahman angry and displeased went to see the blessed one after exchanging greetings and compliments with the blessed one in a friendly and courteous manner he sat down to one side so seated he addressed the blessed one thus in verse what must we slay to live in happiness what must we slay if we would weep no more is there any single thing of which you d approve the killing gotama at these words the brahman said to the blessed one excellent good gotama so the bhaaradvaaja brahman was received into the homeless life under the blessed one and received ordination and not so long after his ordination the venerable bhaaradvaaja remaining alone and secluded heedful ardent and resolute quickly attained that for which young men of good birth rightly go forth from home into the homeless life coming to realize for himself in this present life the unsurpassed goal of the holy life realizing that birth is destroyed the holy life has been accomplished what was to be done is done there is no further life in this world and that bhaaradvaaja became an arahant the blessed one replied when embraced the rod of violence seeingand then i saw before after in between mine mine ness having taken flails young men thresh the corn thus wives and children feed so young men win their wealth so likewise as to buddha s teachings from doing which there s no remorse quickly cleanse your feet and sit you down alone devote yourselves to calm of mind and thus do buddha s teachings when they heard these words patacara s instructions having washed their feet they sat down each one alone devoted themselves to calm of mind and thus followed the buddha s teachings in the night s first watch past births were remembered in the middle watch of the night the eye divine was purified in the night s last watch they rent asunder the mass of gloom having risen they bowed at her feet her instructions having done we shall live revering you like the thirty gods to indra undefeated in war we are with triple knowledge true and gone are all the taints i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at kimila in the bamboo grove then ven kimila went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to the blessed one sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one what is the cause lord what is the reason why when a tathagata has become totally unbound has entered total nibbana the true dhamma does not last a long time kimila there is the case where when a tathagata has become totally unbound the monks nuns male lay followers female lay followers live without respect without deference for the teacher live without respect without deference for the dhamma the sangha the training concentration heedfulness live without respect without deference for hospitality this is the cause this is the reason why when a tathagata has become totally unbound the true dhamma does not last a long time and what is the cause what is the reason why when a tathagata has become totally unbound the true dhamma does last a long time kimila there is the case where when a tathagata has become totally unbound the monks nuns male lay followers female lay followers live with respect with deference for the teacher live with respect with deference for the dhamma the sangha the training concentration heedfulness live with respect with deference for hospitality this is the cause this is the reason why when a tathagata has become totally unbound the true dhamma does last a long time a deva the buddha now at that time a certain monk was sick with dysentery he lay fouled in his own urine excrement then the blessed one on an inspection tour of the lodgings with i have dysentery o blessed one but do you have an attendant no o blessed one then why don t the monks attend to you i don t do anything for the monks lord which is why they don t attend to me then the blessed one addressed ven ananda go fetch some water ananda we will wash this monk as you say lord ven ananda replied and he fetched some water the blessed one sprinkled water on the monk and ven ananda washed him off then with the blessed one taking the monk by the head and ven ananda taking him by the feet they lifted him up and placed him on a bed then the blessed one from this cause because of this event had the monks assembled and asked them is there a sick monk in that dwelling over there yes o blessed one there is and what is his sickness he has dysentery o blessed one but does he have an attendant no o blessed one then why don t the monks attend to him he doesn t do anything for the monks lord which is why they don t attend to him monks you have no mother you have no father who might tend to you if you don t tend to one another who then will tend to you whoever would tend to me should tend to the sick if one s preceptor is present the preceptor should tend to one as long as life lasts and should stay until one s recovery if one s teacher is present the teacher should tend to one as long as life lasts and should stay until one s recovery if one s student is present the student should tend to one as long as life lasts and should stay until one s recovery if one s apprentice is present the apprentice should tend to one as long as life lasts and should stay until one s recovery if one who is a fellow student of one s preceptor is present the fellow student of one s preceptor should tend to one as long as life lasts and should stay until one s recovery if one who is a fellow apprentice of one s teacher is present the fellow apprentice of one s teacher should tend to one as long as life lasts and should stay until one s recovery if no preceptor teacher student apprentice fellow student of one s preceptor or fellow apprentice of one s teacher is present the sangha should tend to one if it does not all the monks in that community incur an offense of wrong doing a sick person endowed with five qualities is easy to tend to he does what is amenable to his cure he knows the proper amount in things amenable to his cure he takes his medicine he tells his symptoms as they actually are present to the nurse desiring his welfare saying that they are worse when they are worse improving when they are improving or remaining the same when they are remaining the same and he is the type who can endure bodily feelings that are painful fierce sharp wracking repellent disagreeable life threatening a sick person endowed with these five qualities is easy to tend to a nurse endowed with five qualities is fit to tend to the sick he is competent at mixing medicine he knows what is amenable or unamenable to the patient s cure taking away things that are unamenable and bringing things that are amenable he is motivated by thoughts of good will not by material gain he does not get disgusted at cleaning up excrement urine saliva or vomit and he is competent at instructing urging rousing encouraging the sick person at the proper occasions with a talk on dhamma a nurse endowed with these five qualities is fit to tend to the sick udaya the buddha udaya the buddha udaya the buddha now at that time the wanderer then but then the thought occurred to sariputta the wanderer this is the wrong time to question him he is going for alms in the town what if i were to follow behind this monk who has found the path for those who seek it then ven assaji having gone for alms in rajagaha left taking his alms then sariputta the wanderer approached him and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he stood to one side as he was standing there he said bright are your faculties my friend pure your complexion and clear on whose account have you gone forth or who is your teacher or in whose dhamma do you delight there is my friend the great contemplative a son of the sakyans gone forth from a sakyan family i have gone forth on account of that blessed one that blessed one is my teacher and it is in that blessed one s dhamma that i delight but what is your teacher s teaching what does he proclaim i am new my friend not long gone forth only recently come to this dhamma discipline i cannot explain the dhamma in detail but i will tell you the gist in brief then sariputta the wanderer spoke thus to the ven assaji speak a little or a lot but tell me just the gist the gist is what i want what use is a lot of verbosity then ven assaji gave this dhamma exposition to sariputta the wanderer whatever phenomena arise from cause their cause their cessation such is the teaching of the tathagata the great contemplative even if just this is the dhamma you have penetrated to the sorrowless asoka state unseen overlooked by us for many myriads of aeons then sariputta the wanderer went to moggallana the wanderer moggallana the wanderer saw him coming from afar and on seeing him said bright are your faculties my friend pure your complexion and clear could it be that you have attained the deathless yes my friend i have attained the deathless but how friend did you attain the deathless just now friend i saw ven assaji going for alms in rajagaha gracious in the way he approached and departed looked forward and behind drew in and stretched out his arm his eyes downcast his every movement consummate on seeing him the thought occurred to me surely of those in this world who are arahants or have entered the path to arahantship this is one what if i were to approach him and question him on whose account have you gone forth or who is your teacher or in whose dhamma do you delight but then the thought occurred to me this is the wrong time to question him he is going for alms in the town what if i were to follow behind this monk who has found the path for those who seek it then ven assaji having gone for alms in rajagaha left taking his alms i approached him and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies i stood to one side as i was standing there i said bright are your faculties my friend pure your complexion and clear on whose account have you gone forth or who is your teacher or in whose dhamma do you delight there is my friend the great contemplative a son of the sakyans gone forth from a sakyan family i have gone forth on account of that blessed one that blessed one is my teacher and it is in that blessed one s dhamma that i delight but what is your teacher s teaching what does he proclaim i am new my friend not long gone forth only recently come to this dhamma discipline i cannot explain the doctrine to you in detail but i will tell you the gist in brief speak a little or a lot but tell me just the gist the gist is what i want what use is a lot of verbosity then ven assaji gave me this dhamma exposition whatever phenomena arise from cause their cause and their cessation such is the teaching of the tathagata the great contemplative even if just this is the dhamma you have penetrated to the sorrowless asoka state unseen overlooked by us for many myriads of aeons i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in yes sutavan you heard it rightly learned it rightly attended to it rightly understood it rightly both before now i say to you that an arahant monk whose mental fermentations are ended who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who is released through right gnosis cannot possibly transgress these it is impossible for a monk whose mental fermentations are ended to intentionally deprive a living being of life it is impossible for a monk whose mental fermentations are ended to take in the manner of stealing what is not given it is impossible for a monk whose mental fermentations are ended to engage in sexual intercourse it is impossible for a monk whose mental fermentations are ended to tell a conscious lie it is impossible for a monk whose mental fermentations are ended to consume stored up sensual things as he did before when he was a householder it is impossible for a monk whose mental fermentations are ended to follow a bias based on desire it is impossible for a monk whose mental fermentations are ended to follow a bias based on aversion it is impossible for a monk whose mental fermentations are ended to follow a bias based on fear it is impossible for a monk whose mental fermentations are ended to follow a bias based on delusion both before and now i say to you that an arahant monk whose mental fermentations are ended who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who is released through right gnosis cannot possibly transgress these nine principles thus have i heard at one time the lord was staying at uruvela for seven days experiencing the bliss of liberation then at the end of those seven days the lord gave well reasoned attention during the last watch of the night to dependent arising in both forward and reverse order thus then on realizing its significance the lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance when things become manifest to the ardent meditating brahman he abides scattering mara s host like the sun illumining the sky i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at saying all right my friend the blessed one went out come in contemplative saying all right my friend the blessed one went in a second time a third time the alavaka yakkha said to the blessed one get out contemplative saying all right my friend the blessed one went out come in contemplative saying all right my friend the blessed one went in then a fourth time the alavaka yakkha said to the blessed one get out contemplative i won t go out my friend do what you have to do my friend i see no one in the cosmos with its devas maras brahmas its contemplatives brahmans its royalty commonfolk who could possess my mind or rip open my heart or grabbing me by the feet hurl me across the ganges but nevertheless ask me what you wish alavaka the buddha alavaka the buddha alavaka the buddha alavaka in whom there s no cravingsetting at savatthi then in the morning the bhikkhuni kisagotami dressed and taking bowl and robe entered savatthi for alms when she had walked for alms in savatthi and had returned from her alms round after her meal she went to the blind men s grove for the day s abiding having plunged into the blind men s grove she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day s abiding then mara the evil one desiring to arouse fear trepidation and terror in the bhikkhuni kisagotami desiring to make her fall away from concentration approached her and addressed her in verse why now when your son is dead do you sit alone with tearful face having entered the woods all alone are you on the lookout for a man then it occurred to the bhikkhuni kisagotami now who is this that recited the verse a human being or a non human being then it occurred to her this is mara the evil one who has recited the verse desiring to arouse fear trepidation and terror in me desiring to make me fall away from concentration then the bhikkhuni kisagotami having understood this is mara the evil one replied to him in verses i ve gotten past the death of sons with this the search for men has ended i do not sorrow i do not weep nor do i fear you friend delight everywhere has been destroyed the mass of darkness has been sundered having conquered the army of death i dwell without defiling taints then mara the evil one realizing the bhikkhuni kisagotami knows me sad and disappointed disappeared right there i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near yes lord the monks responded to him monks i will teach you the great six sense media discourse

it the highest he believes it to be knowledge when he contemplates the pure one the true brahmana a person having undertaken a ritual act goes this way and that fettered by his senses but one with a wide wisdom having understood and gone into the dhamma with his experience does not go this way and that for a person indifferent towards all conditions whatever is seen heard or cognized he is one who sees it as it really is and lives with clarity of mind with what could he be identified in the world they do not speculate nor pursue any notion they do not claim perfect purity loosening the knot of clinging with which they are bound they do not have longing anywhere in the world the true brahmana who has gone beyond limitations having understood and seen there is no longer any assumption for him he is neither disturbed by lust nor agitated by revulsion for him there is nothing upheld as the highest monks in whatever monk or nun there arises desire passion aversion delusion or mental resistance with regard to forms cognizable via the eye he she should hold the mind in check thinking it s dangerous dubious that path thorny overgrown a miserable path a devious path impenetrable it s a path followed by people of no integrity not a path followed by people of integrity it s not worthy of you he she should hold the mind in check with regard to forms cognizable via the eye in whatever monk or nun there arises desire passion aversion delusion or mental resistance with regard to sounds cognizable via the ear aromas cognizable via the nose flavors cognizable via the tongue tactile sensations cognizable via the body ideas cognizable via the intellect he she should hold the mind in check thinking it s dangerous dubious that path thorny overgrown a miserable path a devious path impenetrable it s a path followed by people of no integrity not a path followed by people of integrity it s not worthy of you he she should hold the mind in check with regard to ideas cognizable via the intellect now suppose that corn had ripened and the watchman was heedful the corn eating ox would invade the corn to eat it but then the watchman would grab it firmly by the muzzle having grabbed it firmly by the muzzle he would pin it down by the forehead having pinned it down by the forehead he would give it a sound thrashing with a stick having given it a sound thrashing with a stick he would let it go a second time a third time the corn eating ox would invade the corn to eat it but then the watchman would grab it firmly by the muzzle having grabbed it firmly by the muzzle he would pin it down by the forehead having pinned it down by the forehead he would give it a sound thrashing with a stick having given it a sound thrashing with a stick he would let it go as a result the corn eating ox regardless of whether it went to the village or to the wilds was standing still or lying down wouldn t invade the corn again because it would recall the earlier taste it got of the stick in the same way when a monk s mind is held back thoroughly held back from the six media of sensory contact his mind settles inwardly grows steady unified concentrated in the same way a monk investigates form however far form may go he investigates feeling perception fabrications consciousness however far consciousness may go as he is investigating form feeling perception fabrications consciousness however far consciousness may go any thoughts of me or mine or i am do not occur to him thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living in the deer park at isipatana the resort of saints near varanasi benares then he addressed the monks saying o monks venerable sir replied those monks in assent to the blessed one thereupon he said the matchless wheel of dhamma set in motion by the tathagata of what four it was a proclamation of the noble truth of suffering monks follow sariputta and moggallana associate with sariputta and moggallana wise monks do help materially and spiritually those who live the holy life monks sariputta is like unto a mother moggallana is like unto a foster mother to a child sariputta monks trains beings in the paththis the blessed one said and having said so the welcome being this the venerable sariputta said your reverence the matchless wheel of dhamma set in motion by the tathagata the consummate one the supremely enlightened one in the deer park at isipatana near varanasi cannot be set in motion by a recluse or brahmana as before in the world that is to say it was a proclamation of the four noble truths by way of teaching laying down establishing opening up analyzing and elucidating them of what four it was a proclamation of the noble truth of suffering what your reverence is the noble truth of suffering birth is suffering aging is suffering death is suffering grief lamentation bodily pain mental pain and despair are suffering not getting what one desires that too is suffering in brief the five aggregates subject to grasping are suffering what is birth it is the birth of beings in the various classes planes of beings the production their conception coming into existence re birth the appearance of the aggregates acquiring of the sense bases this is called birth what is aging it is the aging of beings in the various classes of beings their decay broken teeth graying hair wrinkled skin the dwindling of the life span the wearing out of the sense organs this is called aging what is death it is the passing away of beings in the various classes of beings the falling away the breaking up the disappearance the death making end of life the breaking up of the aggregates the laying down of the body this is called death what is grief it is the grief sorrow sorrowfulness the state of being sorry inward sorrow inward intense sorrow visited by some calamity or other smitten by some kind of ill or other this is called grief what is lamentation it is the crying the wailing the act of crying the act of wailing the state of crying the state of wailing of one visited by some calamity or other smitten by some kind of ill or other this is called lamentation what is suffering it is bodily suffering bodily unpleasantness the painful and unpleasant feeling produced by bodily contact this is called suffering what is misery it is mental suffering unpleasantness the painful and unpleasant feeling produced by mental contact this is called misery what is despair it is despondency despair the state of despondency the state of despair of one visited by some calamity or other this is called despair what is meant by not getting what one desires that too is suffering to beings subject to birth there comes desire o might we not be subject to birth and birth not come to us but this cannot be attained by mere desiring so not getting what one desires that too is suffering to beings subject to aging there comes the desire o might we not be subject to aging and aging not come to us as before to beings subject to disease there comes the desire o might we not be subject to disease and disease not come to us to beings subject to death there comes the desire o might we not be subject to death and death not come to us to beings subject to sorrow lamentation suffering misery and despair there comes the desire o might we not be subject to sorrow lamentation suffering misery and despair and sorrow lamentation suffering misery and despair not come to us but this cannot be attained by merely desiring so not getting what one desires that too is suffering what in brief are the five aggregates subject to grasping that are suffering these are the aggregate of matter subject to grasping the aggregate of feeling the aggregate of perception the aggregate of mental volitional formations the aggregate of consciousness subject to grasping these are called in brief the five aggregates subject to grasping that are suffering this is called the noble truth of suffering what is the noble truth of the arising of suffering it is this craving which produces re becoming re birth accompanied by passionate greed and finding delight now here now there namely the craving for sense pleasures craving for existence and craving for non existence self annihilation this is called the noble truth of the arising of suffering what is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering it is the complete cessation of that very craving giving it up relinquishing it liberating oneself from it and detaching oneself from it this is called the noble truth of the cessation of suffering and what is the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering it is this noble eightfold path itself namely right understanding right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration what is right understanding it is this knowledge of suffering knowledge of the arising of suffering knowledge of the cessation of suffering knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of suffering this is called right understanding what is right thought thought of renunciation thought of goodwill thought of not harming this is called right thought what is right speech abstention from false speech abstention from tale bearing abstention from harsh abusive speech abstention from idle chatter gossip this is called right speech what is right action abstention from killing abstention from stealing abstention from illicit sexual indulgence this is called right action what is right livelihood herein in this dispensation the ariyan disciple avoiding wrong livelihood makes his living by right livelihood this is called right livelihood what is right effort herein a monk puts forth will strives stirs up energy strengthens his mind exerts himself to prevent the arising of evil of unwholesome thoughts that have not yet arisen puts forth will as before to banish the evil unwholesome thoughts that have already arisen puts forth will to develop wholesome thoughts that have not yet arisen and puts forth will strives stirs up energy strengthens his mind exerts himself to maintain to preserve increase to bring them to maturity development and to complete the wholesome thoughts that have arisen this is called right effort what is right mindfulness herein a monk lives practicing body contemplation on the body ardent clearly comprehending and mindful of it having overcome covetousness and dejection concerning the world of the body he lives practicing feeling contemplation on the feelings ardent clearly comprehending and mindful of it having overcome covetousness and dejection concerning the world of feelings he lives practicing mind contemplation on the mind ardent clearly comprehending and mindful of it having overcome covetousness and dejection concerning the world of the mind he lives practicing mind object contemplation on the mind objects ardent clearly comprehending and mindful of it having overcome covetousness and dejection concerning the world of mental objects this is called right mindfulness and what is right concentration herein a monk aloof from sense desires aloof from unwholesome thoughts attains to and abides in the first meditative absorption by allaying applied and sustained thought he attains to and abides in the second by detachment from joy he dwells in equanimity mindful and with clear comprehension and enjoys bliss in body and attains to and abides in the third by giving up of bliss and suffering by the disappearance already of joy and sorrow he attains to and abides in the fourth this is called the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering your reverence the matchless wheel of dhamma set in motion by the tathagata the consumate one the supremely enlightened one in the deer park at isipatana near varanasi cannot be set in motion by a recluse or brahmana or deva or brahma or by anyone in the world that is to say it was a proclamation of the four noble truths by way of teaching laying down establishing opening up analyzing and elucidating them this the venerable sariputta said those monks glad at heart rejoiced at the words of the venerable sariputta at such times monks as the mind is sluggish that is the wrong time to cultivate the enlightenment factor suppose a man wants to make a small fire blaze if he heaps wet grass wet cow dung and wet sticks on it if he exposes it to wind and rain and sprinkles it with dust can he make that small fire blaze no indeed lord just so when the mind is sluggish it is the wrong time to cultivate the enlightenment factors of tranquillity concentration and equanimity because a sluggish mind is hard to arouse through these factors but monks when the mind is sluggish that is the right time to cultivate the enlightenment factor of investigation of states the enlightenment factor of energy the enlightenment factor of rapture suppose a man wants to make a small fire blaze if he heaps dry grass dry cow dung and dry sticks on it blows on it with his mouth and does not sprinkle it with dust can he make that fire blaze yes indeed lord a sluggish mind is easy to arouse through these factors monks when the mind is agitated suppose a man wants to put a big fire out if he heaps dry cow dung and dry sticks on it blow on it with his mouth and does not sprinkle it with dust can he put that fire out no indeed lord an agitated mind is not easy to calm through these factors when the mind is agitated that is the right time to cultivate the enlightenment factors of tranquillity concentration equanimity why because an agitated mind is easy to calm suppose a man wants to put out a big fire if he heaps wet grass wet cow dung wet sticks on it and if he exposes it to wind and rain if he sprinkles it with dust can he put that big fire out yes indeed lord just so monks when the mind is agitated that is the right time to cultivate the enlightenment factors of tranquillity concentration equanimity an agitated mind is easy to calm through these factors but as for mindfulness monks i declare that it is always useful on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the then as he was alone in seclusion this line of thought arose in his awareness i have turned away the community of monks but here there are monks who are new not long gone forth only recently come to this dhamma discipline if they do not see me there may be alteration in them there may be change then the blessed one acquiesced with silence then brahma sahampati sensing the blessed one s acquiescence bowed down to the blessed one and after circumambulating him disappeared right there then the blessed one emerging from seclusion in the evening went to the banyan park on arrival he sat down on a seat made ready after he had sat down he worked a psychic feat such that the monks went to him contritely in ones and twos on arrival they bowed down to him and sat to one side as they were sitting there the blessed one said to them monks this is the lowliest form of livelihood that of an almsgoer a term of abuse in the world is you go about as an almsgoer with a bowl in your hand and yet sons of good family take up this livelihood with compelling reason in dependence on a compelling reason not coerced by kings nor coerced by thieves nor from debt nor from fear nor to earn a livelihood but with the thought i am oppressed with birth aging death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses despairs i am oppressed with stress overcome with stress perhaps an ending of this entire mass of suffering stress might be found and although this son of a good family has gone forth in this way he is covetous with strong passion for sensual desires with a mind of ill will of corrupt resolves his mindfulness muddled unalert unconcentrated his mind distracted loose in his sense faculties what do you think monks is form constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord is feeling constant or inconstant inconstant lord is perception constant or inconstant inconstant lord are fabrications constant or inconstant inconstant lord what do you think monks is consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord thus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am any feeling whatsoever any perception whatsoever any fabrications whatsoever any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness through disenchantment he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is fully released with full release there is the knowledge fully released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world monks these five future dangers unarisen at present will arise in the future be alert to them and being alert work to get rid of them which five there will be in the course of the future monks undeveloped in body this monks is the first future danger unarisen at present that will arise in the future be alert to it and being alert work to get rid of it and again there will be in the course of the future monks undeveloped in body undeveloped in virtue undeveloped in mind undeveloped in discernment they being undeveloped in body undeveloped in virtue undeveloped in mind undeveloped in discernment will take on others as students and will not be able to discipline them in heightened virtue heightened mind heightened discernment these too will then be undeveloped in body virtue mind discernment they being undeveloped in body virtue mind discernment will take on still others as students and will not be able to discipline them in heightened virtue heightened mind heightened discernment these too will then be undeveloped in body virtue mind discernment thus from corrupt dhamma comes corrupt discipline from corrupt discipline corrupt dhamma this monks is the second future danger unarisen at present that will arise in the future be alert to it and being alert work to get rid of it and again there will be in the course of the future monks undeveloped in body virtue mind discernment they being undeveloped in body virtue mind discernment when giving a talk on higher dhamma or a talk composed of questions and answers will fall into dark mental states without being aware of it thus from corrupt dhamma comes corrupt discipline from corrupt discipline corrupt dhamma this monks is the third future danger unarisen at present that will arise in the future be alert to it and being alert work to get rid of it and again there will be in the course of the future monks undeveloped in body virtue mind discernment they being undeveloped in body virtue mind discernment will not listen when discourses that are words of the tathagata deep profound transcendent connected with the void are being recited they will not lend ear will not set their hearts on knowing them will not regard these teachings as worth grasping or mastering but they will listen when discourses that are literary works the works of poets elegant in sound elegant in rhetoric the work of outsiders words of disciples are recited they will lend ear and set their hearts on knowing them they will regard these teachings as worth grasping and mastering thus from corrupt dhamma comes corrupt discipline from corrupt discipline corrupt dhamma this monks is the fourth future danger unarisen at present that will arise in the future be alert to it and being alert work to get rid of it and again there will be in the course of the future monks undeveloped in body virtue mind discernment they being undeveloped in body virtue mind discernment will become elders living in luxury lethargic foremost in falling back shirking the duties of solitude they will not make an effort for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized they will become an example for later generations who will become luxurious in their living lethargic foremost in falling back shirking the duties of solitude and who will not make an effort for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized thus from corrupt dhamma comes corrupt discipline from corrupt discipline corrupt dhamma this monks is the fifth future danger unarisen at present that will arise in the future be alert to it and being alert work to get rid of it these monks are the five future dangers unarisen at present that will arise in the future be alert to them and being alert work to get rid of them thus have i heard at one time the blessed one was living among the kurus at kammasadamma a market town of the kuru people there the blessed one addressed the bhikkhu thus monks and they replied to him venerable sir the blessed one spoke as follows this is the only way monks for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation for the destruction of suffering and grief for reaching the right path for the attainment of nibbana namely the four foundations of mindfulness what are the four herein in this teaching a monk lives contemplating the body in the body i the contemplation of the body mindfulness of breathingand how does a monk live contemplating the body in the body herein monks a monk having gone to the forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty place sits down with his legs crossed keeps his

words monks i lived in refinement utmost refinement total refinement my father even had lotus ponds made in our palace one where red lotuses bloomed one where white lotuses bloomed one where blue lotuses bloomed all for my sake i used no sandalwood that was not from varanasi my turban was from varanasi as were my tunic my lower garments my outer cloak a white sunshade was held over me day night to protect me from cold heat dust dirt dew i had even though i was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me when an untaught run of the mill person himself subject to aging not beyond aging sees another who is aged he is horrified humiliated disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to aging not beyond aging if i who am subject to aging not beyond aging were to be horrified humiliated disgusted on seeing another person who is aged that would not be fitting for me as i noticed this the typical young person s intoxication with youth entirely dropped away even though i was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me when an untaught run of the mill person himself subject to illness not beyond illness

a forest lodging and they were haughty unsteady garrulous of loose speech unmindful thoughtless without concentration with wandering minds and faculties uncontrolled now jantu son of the devas on a fifteenth day uposatha happy was the life in former times led by gotama s disciples then unhankering they sought their frugal alms unhankering their lodging and their bed the world s impermanence they understood knowing this they made an end of woe now making evil doers of themselves just like village headmen they behave eating eating till they drop with sleep coveting the things their neighbor has to the sangha having paid respect certain bhikkhus present here i greet others are like outcasts masterless to the realm of hungry ghosts then a certain monk went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one lord is there any one thing with whose abandoning in a monk ignorance is abandoned and clear knowing arises yes monk there is one thing with whose abandoning in a monk ignorance is abandoned and clear knowing arises what is that one thing ignorance monk is the one thing with whose abandoning in a monk ignorance is abandoned and clear knowing arises but how does a monk know how does a monk see so that ignorance is abandoned and clear knowing arises there is the case monk where a monk has heard all things are unworthy of attachment having heard that all things are unworthy of attachment he directly knows every thing directly knowing every thing he comprehends every thing comprehending every thing he sees all themes he sees the eye as something separate he sees forms as something separate he sees eye consciousness as something separate he sees eye contact as something separate and whatever arises in dependence on eye contact experienced either as pleasure as pain or as neither pleasure nor pain that too he sees as something separate he sees the ear as something separate he sees the nose as something separate he sees the tongue as something separate he sees the body as something separate he sees the intellect as something separate he sees ideas as something separate he sees intellect consciousness as something separate he sees intellect contact as something separate and whatever arises in dependence on intellect contact experienced either as pleasure as pain or as neither pleasure nor pain that too he sees as something separate this is how a monk knows this is how a monk sees so that ignorance is abandoned and clear knowing arises then very well then sivaka i

you discern that greed is not present within me yes lord the fact that when greed is present within you you discern that greed is present within you and when greed is not present within you you discern that greed is not present within you that is one way in which the dhamma is visible in the here now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselves what do you think when aversion is present within you when delusion is present within you when a greedy quality what do you think when a delusive quality is present within you do you discern that a delusive quality is present within me and when a delusive quality is not present within you do you discern that a delusive quality is not present within me yes lord the fact that when a delusive quality is present within you you discern that a delusive quality is present within you and when a delusive quality is not present within you you discern that a delusive quality is not present within you that is

yet unacquired discernment that is basic to the holy life and to the increase plenitude development culmination of that which has already been acquired i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion a certain lay follower from icch na galaka had arrived in s vatth on some business affairs having settled his affairs in s vatth he went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him at long last you have managed to come here for a long time lord have i wanted to come see the blessed one but being involved in one business affair after another i have not been able to do so then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed how blissful it is for one who has nothing who has mastered the dhamma is learned see him suffering one who has something a person bound in body with people see also monks these there is the case of the individual who has attained internal tranquillity of awareness but not insight into phenomena through heightened discernment then there is the case of the individual who has attained insight into phenomena through heightened discernment but not internal tranquillity of awareness then there is the case of the individual who has attained neither internal tranquillity of awareness nor insight into phenomena through heightened discernment and then there is the case of the individual who has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness insight into phenomena through heightened discernment the individual who has attained internal tranquillity of awareness but not insight into phenomena through heightened discernment should approach an individual who has attained insight into phenomena through heightened discernment and ask him how should fabrications be regarded how should they be investigated how should they be seen with insight the other will answer in line with what he has seen experienced fabrications should be regarded in this way fabrications should be investigated in this way fabrications should be seen in this way with insight then eventually he the first will become one who has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness insight into phenomena through heightened discernment as for the individual who has attained insight into phenomena through heightened discernment but not internal tranquillity of awareness he should approach an individual who has attained internal tranquillity of awareness and ask him how should the mind be steadied how should it be made to settle down how should it be unified how should it be concentrated the other will answer in line with what he has seen experienced the mind should be steadied in this way the mind should be made to settle down in this way the mind should be unified in this way the mind should be concentrated in this way then eventually he the first will become one who has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness insight into phenomena through heightened discernment as for the individual who has attained neither internal tranquillity of awareness nor insight into phenomena through heightened discernment he should approach an individual who has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness insight into phenomena through heightened discernment and ask him how should the mind be steadied how should it be made to settle down how should it be unified how should it be concentrated how should fabrications be regarded how should they be investigated how should they be seen with insight the other will answer in line with what he has seen experienced the mind should be steadied in this way the mind should be made to settle down in this way the mind should be unified in this way the mind should be concentrated in this way fabrications should be regarded in this way fabrications should be investigated in this way fabrications should be seen in this way with insight then eventually he the first will become one who has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness insight into phenomena through heightened discernment as for the individual who has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness insight into phenomena through heightened discernment his duty is to make an effort in establishing tuning those very same skillful qualities to a higher degree for the ending of the mental fermentations these are four types of individuals to be found existing in the world monks a statement endowed with five factors is well spoken not ill spoken it is blameless unfaulted by knowledgeable people which five it is spoken at the right time it is spoken in truth it is spoken affectionately it is spoken beneficially it is spoken with a mind of good will a statement endowed with these five factors is well spoken not ill spoken it is blameless unfaulted by knowledgeable people then householder the blessed one has spoken of three feelings a feeling of pleasure a feeling of pain a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain these are the three feelings the blessed one has spoken of when this was said pa cakanga the carpenter said to ven udayin the blessed one has not spoken of three feelings he has spoken of two feelings a feeling of pleasure and a feeling of pain as for the feeling of neither pleasure nor pain the blessed one has spoken of it as a refined pleasure a second time ven udayin said to pa cakanga the carpenter householder the blessed one has not spoken of two feelings he has spoken of three feelings a second time pa cakanga the carpenter said to ven udayin the blessed one has not spoken of three feelings he has spoken of two feelings a third time ven udayin said to pa cakanga the carpenter householder the blessed one has not spoken of two feelings he has spoken of three feelings a third time pa cakanga the carpenter said to ven udayin the blessed one has not spoken of three feelings he has spoken of two feelings neither was ven udayin able to convince pa cakanga the carpenter nor was pa cakanga the carpenter able to convince ven udayin now the blessed one said ananda true was the exposition that pa cakanga the carpenter would not accept from ven udayin and true was the exposition that ven udayin would not accept from pa cakanga the carpenter there is the exposition by which i have spoken of two feelings the exposition by which i have spoken of three feelings five feelings six feelings eighteen feelings feelings feelings and what ananda is another pleasure more extreme refined than that there is the case where a monk quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation this is another pleasure more extreme refined than that though some might say that is the highest pleasure that beings experience i would not grant them that why is that because there is another pleasure more extreme refined than that and what ananda is another pleasure more extreme refined than that there is the case where a monk with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance this is another pleasure more extreme refined than that though some might say that is the highest pleasure that beings experience i would not grant them that why is that because there is another pleasure more extreme refined than that and what ananda is another pleasure more extreme refined than that there is the case where a monk with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding this is another pleasure more extreme refined than that though some might say that is the highest pleasure that beings experience i would not grant them that why is that because there is another pleasure more extreme refined than that and what ananda is another pleasure more extreme refined than that there is the case where a monk with the abandoning of pleasure stress as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain this is another pleasure more extreme refined than that though some might say that is the highest pleasure that beings experience i would not grant them that why is that because there is another pleasure more extreme refined than that and what ananda is another pleasure more extreme refined than that there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving infinite space enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space this is another pleasure more extreme refined than that though some might say that is the highest pleasure that beings experience i would not grant them that why is that because there is another pleasure more extreme refined than that and what ananda is another pleasure more extreme refined than that there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space perceiving infinite consciousness enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness this is another pleasure more extreme refined than that though some might say that is the highest pleasure that beings experience i would not grant them that why is that because there is another pleasure more extreme refined than that and what ananda is another pleasure more extreme refined than that there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness perceiving there is nothing enters remains in the dimension of nothingness this is another pleasure more extreme refined than that though some might say that is the highest pleasure that beings experience i would not grant them that why is that because there is another pleasure more extreme refined than that and what ananda is another pleasure more extreme refined than that there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness enters remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non perception this is another pleasure more extreme refined than that though some might say that is the highest pleasure that beings experience i would not grant them that why is that because there is another pleasure more extreme refined than that and what ananda is another pleasure more extreme refined than that there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception enters remains in the cessation of perception feeling this is another pleasure more extreme refined than that now it s possible ananda that some wanderers of other persuasions might say gotama the contemplative speaks of the cessation of perception feeling and yet describes it as pleasure what is this how can this be when they say that they are to be told it s not the case friends that the blessed one describes only pleasant feeling as included under pleasure wherever pleasure is found in whatever terms the blessed one describes it as pleasure the three kinds of feelings o monks are impermanent compounded dependently arisen liable to destruction to evanescence to fading away to cessation namely pleasant feeling painful feeling and neutral feeling thus have i heard once while the blessed one was staying in the vicinity of saavatthi in the jeta grove in anaathapi n dika s monastery a certain deity whose surpassing brilliance and beauty illumined the entire jeta grove late one night came to the presence of the blessed one having come to him and offered profound salutations he stood on one side and spoke to him reverently in the following verse many deities and human beings have pondered what are blessings which they hope will bring them safety declare to them sir the highest blessing here ends the discourse on blessings to this the blessed one replied i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the sakyans near kapilavatthu in nigrodha s park then mahanama the sakyan went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one lord this kapilavatthu is rich prosperous populous crowded its alleys congested sometimes when i enter kapilavatthu in the evening after visiting with the blessed one or with the monks who inspire the mind i meet up with a runaway elephant a runaway horse a runaway chariot a runaway cart or a runaway person at times like that my mindfulness with regard to the blessed one gets muddled my mindfulness with regard to the dhamma the sangha gets muddled the thought occurs to me if i were to die at this moment what would be my destination what would be my future course have no fear mahanama have no fear your death will not be a bad one your demise will not be bad if one s mind has long been nurtured with conviction nurtured with virtue nurtured with learning nurtured with relinquishment nurtured with discernment then when the body endowed with form composed of the four primary elements born from mother father nourished with rice porridge subject to inconstancy rubbing pressing dissolution dispersion is eaten by crows vultures hawks dogs hyenas or all sorts of creatures nevertheless the mind long nurtured with conviction nurtured with virtue learning relinquishment discernment rises upward and separates out have no fear mahanama have no fear your death will not be a bad one your demise will not be bad i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion approximately monks headed by ven yasoja had arrived in s vatth to see the blessed one as these visiting monks were exchanging greetings with the resident monks setting their lodgings in order and putting away their robes bowls they made a loud racket a great racket then the blessed one said to ven nanda nanda what is that loud racket that great racket like fishermen with a catch of fish lord those are approximately monks headed by ven yasoja who have arrived in s vatth to see the blessed one as these visiting monks are exchanging greetings with the resident monks setting their lodgings in order and putting away their robes bowls they are making a loud racket a great racket in that case nanda tell those monks in my name the teacher calls you friends responding as you say lord to the blessed one ven nanda went to the monks and said the teacher calls you friends responding as you say friend to ven nanda the monks went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there the blessed one said to them monks why were you making that loud racket that great racket like fishermen with a catch of fish when this was said ven yasoja said to the blessed one lord these monks have arrived in s vatth to see the blessed one as they were exchanging greetings with the resident monks setting their lodgings in order and putting away their robes bowls they made a loud racket a great racket go away monks i dismiss you you are not to stay in my vicinity responding as you say lord to the blessed one the monks got up from their seats bowed down to the blessed one and left circling him to the right setting their lodgings in order and taking their robes bowls they went wandering among the vajjians after wandering by stages among the vajjians they came to the river vaggamud there on the bank of the river vaggamud they made leaf huts and entered the rains retreat then ven yasoja addressed the monks as they entered the rains retreat friends the blessed one dismissed us wishing for our benefit seeking our wellbeing being sympathetic and acting out of sympathy let s live in such a way that the blessed one will be gratified by our way of living as you say friend the monks responded to ven yasoja and so living secluded ardent resolute every one of them realized the three knowledges remembrance of past lives knowledge of the arising passing away of living beings and knowledge of the ending of mental effluents in the course of that very rains retreat then the blessed one having stayed as long as he liked in s vatth went wandering in the direction of ves l after wandering by stages he arrived in ves l and stayed there in the peaked roof pavilion in the great wood then encompassing with his awareness the awareness of the monks staying on the bank of the river vaggamud he said to ven nanda this direction seems bright to me nanda this direction seems dazzling to me it s not at all repugnant for me to go pay attention to where the monks on the bank of the river vaggamud are staying send a messenger into their presence to say the teacher calls you friends the teacher wants to see you responding as you say lord to the blessed one ven nanda went to a certain monk and said come now friend go to the monks on the bank of the river vaggamud and say to them the teacher calls you friends the teacher wants to see you responding as you say friend to ven nanda the monk just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm disappeared from the peaked roof pavilion in the great wood and appeared in front of the monks on the bank of the river vaggamud then he said to them the teacher calls you friends the teacher wants to see you responding as you say friend to the monk the monks set their lodgings in order and taking their robes bowls disappeared from the bank of the river vaggamud just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm and appeared in the presence of the blessed one in the peaked roof pavilion in the great wood now at that time the blessed one was sitting in imperturbable concentration either in the fourth jh na the dimension of the infinitude of space or the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the thought occurred to the monks now in which mental dwelling is the blessed one now residing then they realized he is residing in the imperturbable dwelling so they all sat in imperturbable concentration then ven nanda when the night was far advanced at the end of the first watch got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the blessed one paying homage with his hands placed palm to palm over his heart and said to him the night lord is far advanced the first watch has ended the visiting monks have been sitting here a long time may the blessed one greet them when this was said the blessed one remained silent then a second time when the night was far advanced at the end of the middle watch ven nanda got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the blessed one paying homage to him with his hands placed palm to palm over his heart and said to him the night lord is far advanced the middle watch has ended the visiting monks have been sitting here a long time may the blessed one greet them when this was said the blessed one remained silent then a third time when the night was far advanced at the end of the last watch as dawn was approaching and the face of the night was beaming ven nanda got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the blessed one paying homage to him with his hands placed palm to palm over his heart and said to him the night lord is far advanced the last watch has ended dawn is approaching and the face of the night is beaming the visiting monks have been sitting here a long time may the blessed one greet them then the blessed one emerging from his imperturbable concentration said to ven nanda nanda if you had known not even that much would have occurred to you to say then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed in whom they re defeated the thorn of sensuality insult assault imprisonment like a mountain standing unperturbed he doesn t quiver from pleasures pains a monk i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near r jagaha at the bamboo grove the squirrels sanctuary and on that occasion ven mah kassapa was staying at the pipphali cave afflicted in pain seriously ill then at a later time he recovered from his illness when he had recovered from the illness the thought occurred to him what if i were to go into r jagaha for alms now on that occasion devat s were in a state of eagerness for the chance to give alms to ven mah kassapa but ven mah kassapa turning down those devat s early in the morning adjusted his under robethen on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed supporting no others unknown i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in the yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said monks sensuality is inconstant hollow vain deceptive it is illusory the babble of fools sensuality here now sensuality in lives to come sensual perceptions here now

done so these evil unskillful mental states greed ill will contentiousness would not come into being with their abandoning my mind would become unlimited immeasurable well developed practicing

should not occur to me a certain such monk might ananda and another might not what is the cause what is the reason whereby one might and another might not there is the case ananda where a monk having practiced in this way thinking it should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to me what is what has come to be that i abandon obtains equanimity he relishes that equanimity welcomes it remains fastened to it as he relishes that equanimity welcomes it remains fastened to it his consciousness is dependent on it is sustained by it clings to it with clinging sustenance ananda a monk is not totally unbound being sustained where is that monk sustained the dimension of neither perception nor non perception then indeed being sustained he is sustained by the supreme sustenance being sustained ananda he it s amazing lord it s astounding for truly the blessed one has declared to us the way to cross over the flood by going from one support to the next but what is the noble liberation there is the case ananda where a disciple of the noble ones considers this sensuality here now sensuality in lives to come sensual perceptions here now sensual perceptions

sustenance now ananda i have taught the practice conducive to the imperturbable i have taught the practice conducive to the dimension of nothingness i have taught the practice conducive to the dimension of neither perception nor non perception i have taught the way to cross over the flood by going from one support to the next the noble liberation whatever a teacher should do seeking the welfare of his disciples out of sympathy for them that have i done for you over there are the roots of trees over there empty dwellings practice jhana ananda don t be heedless don t later fall into regret this is our message to you all that is what the blessed one said gratified ven ananda delighted in the blessed one s words monks there are these nine step by step dwellings which nine the first jh na the second jh na the third jh na the fourth jh na the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor non perception the cessation of perception feeling these are the nine step by step dwellings i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at the eastern monastery the palace of mig ra s mother and on that occasion the blessed one it being the observance day was sitting surrounded by the community of monks then ven nanda when the night was far advanced at the end of the first watch got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the blessed one paying homage with his hands placed palm to palm over his heart and said to him lord the night is far advanced the first watch has ended the community of monks has been sitting here long may the blessed one recite the p imokkha to them when this was said the blessed one remained silent then a second time when the night was far advanced at the end of the middle watch ven nanda got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the blessed one paying homage with his hands placed palm to palm over his heart and said to him lord the night is far advanced the second watch has ended the community of monks has been sitting here long may the blessed one recite the p imokkha to them when this was said the blessed one remained silent then a third time when the night was far advanced at the end of the last watch as dawn was approaching and the face of the night was beaming ven nanda got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the blessed one paying homage with his hands placed palm to palm over his heart and said to him lord the night is far advanced the last watch has ended dawn is approaching and the face of the night is beaming the community of monks has been sitting here long may the blessed one recite the p imokkha to the community of monks nanda the gathering isn t pure then the thought occurred to ven mah moggall na in reference to which individual did the blessed one just now say nanda the gathering isn t pure so he directed his mind encompassing with his awareness the awareness of the entire community of monks he saw that individual unprincipled evil unclean and suspect in his undertakings hidden in his actions not a contemplative though claiming to be one not leading the holy life though claiming to do so inwardly rotten oozing with desire filthy by nature sitting in the midst of the community of monks on seeing him he got up went over to that individual and on reaching him said get up friend you have been seen by the blessed one you have no affiliation with the community of monks then the individual remained silent a second time a third time ven mah moggall na said get up friend you have been seen by the blessed one you have no affiliation with the community of monks and for a third time the individual remained silent then ven mah moggall na grabbing that individual by the arm having expelled him through the outside door of the porch and locking the bolt approached the blessed one and on arrival said i have expelled that individual lord the gathering is now pure let the blessed one recite the p imokkha to the community of monks isn t it amazing moggall na isn t it astounding how that worthless man waited until he was grabbed by the arm then the blessed one addressed the monks from now on i will no longer perform the observance or recite the p imokkha from now on you alone monks will perform the observance and recite the p imokkha it is impossible it cannot happen that a tath gata would perform the observance or recite the p imokkha with an impure gathering

won t get soddened by the rain see also an i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in i am not getting better lord i am not comfortable my extreme pains are increasing not

in the blessed one s words and ven maha kassapa recovered from his disease that was how ven maha kassapa s disease was abandoned monks when a royal frontier fortress is well provided with the seven requisites of a fortress and can obtain at will without difficulty without trouble the four types of food then it is said to be a royal frontier fortress that can t be undone by external foes or

in the same way monks when a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with seven true qualities now with which seven true qualities is he endowed these are the seven true qualities with which he is endowed and which are the four jhanas heightened mental states that provide a pleasant abiding in the here now that he can obtain at will without difficulty without trouble these are the four jhanas heightened mental states that provide a pleasant abiding in the here now that he can obtain at will without difficulty without trouble when a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with these seven true qualities and can obtain at will without difficulty without trouble these four jhanas heightened mental states that provide a pleasant abiding in the here now he is said to be a disciple of the noble ones who can t be undone by mara can t be undone by the evil one first in virtue were the men of old brahmans who preserved the ancient ways in whom well guarded were the doors of the sense they were never overcome by wrath meditating on the law in this case brahman someone seeing objects with the eye is attracted to things that are pleasing and repelled by things that are unpleasing he dwells without mindfulness and his mind is restricted he does not experience the emancipation of the heart through wisdom and so those evil and unwholesome states do not cease without remainder hearing a sound smelling a scent tasting a flavor touching an object cognizing a mind object he is attracted by things that are pleasing and repelled by things that are unpleasing and so those evil and unwholesome states do not cease without remainder that is how one is with sense doors unguarded now in what way is one with sense doors guarded in this case brahman a monk seeing objects with the eye is not attracted to things that are pleasing and not repelled by things that are unpleasing he dwells with mindfulness present and his mind is unbounded thus he experiences the emancipation of the heart through wisdom and so those evil and unwholesome states that arise cease without remainder i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion there were many contemplatives brahmans wanderers of various sects living around s vatth with differing views differing opinions differing beliefs dependent for support on their differing views some of the contemplatives brahmans held this doctrine this view the self the cosmos are eternal only this is true anything otherwise is worthless some of the contemplatives brahmans held this doctrine this view the self the cosmos are not eternal the self the cosmos are both eternal and not eternal the self the cosmos are neither eternal nor not eternal the self the cosmos are self made the self the cosmos are other made the self the cosmos are both self made other made the self the cosmos without self making without other making are spontaneously arisen pleasure pain the self the cosmos are self made other made both self made other made pleasure pain the self the cosmos without self making without other making are spontaneously arisen only this is true anything otherwise is worthless and they kept on arguing quarreling disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying the dhamma is like this it s not like that the dhamma s not like that it s like this then in the early morning a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and carrying their bowls robes went into s vatth for alms having gone for alms in s vatth after the meal returning from their alms round they went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they said to the blessed one lord there are many contemplatives brahmans wanderers of various sects living around s vatth with differing views differing opinions differing beliefs dependent for support on their differing views and they keep on arguing quarreling disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying the dhamma is like this it s not like that the dhamma s not like that it s like this monks the wanderers of other sects are blind eyeless they don t know what is beneficial and what is harmful they don t know what is the dhamma and what is non dhamma not knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful not knowing what is dhamma and what is non dhamma they keep on arguing quarreling disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying the dhamma is like this it s not like that the dhamma s not like that it s like this then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed people are intent on the idea of i making and attached to the idea of other making some don t realize this nor do they see it as an arrow but to one who having extracted this arrow sees the thought i am doing see also i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was wandering among the kosalans with a large community of monks then coming down from the road he went to a certain tree and on arrival sat down on a seat laid out a certain cowherd then went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one instructed urged roused encouraged him with dhamma talk the cowherd instructed urged roused encouraged by the blessed one s talk on dhamma said to him lord may the blessed one together with the community of monks acquiesce to my offer of tomorrow s meal the blessed one acquiesced with silence then the cowherd understanding the blessed one s acquiescence got up from his seat bowed down to the blessed one and left circling him to the right then after the night had passed the cowherd having prepared in his own home a great deal of thick milk rice porridge fresh ghee announced the time of the meal to the blessed one it s time lord the meal is ready so the blessed one early in the morning adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl robes went together with the community of monks to the cowherd s home on arrival he sat down on a seat laid out the cowherd with his own hand served satisfied the community of monks headed by the blessed one with thick milk rice porridge fresh ghee then when the blessed one had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl the cowherd taking a lower seat sat down to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one instructed urged roused encouraged him with dhamma talk then got up from his seat left now not long after the blessed one s departure the cowherd was killed by a certain man between the boundaries of two villages a large number of monks then went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they told him the cowherd who today served satisfied the community of monks headed by the blessed one with thick milk rice porridge fresh ghee has been killed it is said by a certain man between the boundaries of two villages then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed whatever an enemy might do to an enemy or a foe to a foe the ill directed mind can do to you even worse see also monks an uninstructed run of the mill person feels feelings of pleasure feelings of pain feelings of neither pleasure nor pain a well instructed disciple of the noble ones also feels feelings of pleasure feelings of pain feelings of neither pleasure nor pain so what difference what distinction what distinguishing factor is there between the well instructed disciple of the noble ones and the uninstructed run of the mill person for us lord the teachings have the blessed one as their root their guide their arbitrator it would be good if the blessed one himself would explicate the meaning of this statement having heard it from the blessed one the monks will remember it in that case monks listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said when touched with a feeling of pain the uninstructed run of the mill person sorrows grieves laments beats his breast becomes distraught so he feels two pains physical mental as he is touched by that painful feeling he is resistant any resistance obsession with regard to that painful feeling obsesses him touched by that painful feeling he delights in sensual pleasure why is that because the uninstructed run of the mill person does not discern any escape from painful feeling aside from sensual pleasure as he is delighting in sensual pleasure any passion obsession with regard to that feeling of pleasure obsesses him he does not discern as it actually is present the origination passing away allure drawback or escape from that feeling as he does not discern the origination passing away allure drawback or escape from that feeling then any ignorance obsession with regard to that feeling of neither pleasure nor pain obsesses him sensing a feeling of pleasure he senses it as though joined with it sensing a feeling of pain he senses it as though joined with it sensing a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain he senses it as though joined with it this is called an uninstructed run of the mill person joined with birth aging death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses despairs he is joined i tell you with suffering stress now the well instructed disciple of the noble ones when touched with a feeling of pain does not sorrow grieve or lament does not beat his breast or become distraught so he feels one pain physical but not mental just as if they were to shoot a man with an arrow and right afterward did not shoot him with another one so that he would feel the pain of only one arrow in the same way when touched with a feeling of pain the well instructed disciple of the noble ones does not sorrow grieve or lament does not beat his breast or become distraught he feels one pain physical but not mental as he is touched by that painful feeling he is not resistant no resistance obsession with regard to that painful feeling obsesses him touched by that painful feeling he does not delight in sensual pleasure why is that because the well instructed disciple of the noble ones discerns an escape from painful feeling aside from sensual pleasure as he is not delighting in sensual pleasure no passion obsession with regard to that feeling of pleasure obsesses him he discerns as it actually is present the origination passing away allure drawback and escape from that feeling as he discerns the origination passing away allure drawback and escape from that feeling no ignorance obsession with regard to that feeling of neither pleasure nor pain obsesses him sensing a feeling of pleasure he senses it disjoined from it sensing a feeling of pain he senses it disjoined from it sensing a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain he senses it disjoined from it this is called a well instructed disciple of the noble ones disjoined from birth aging death from sorrows lamentations pains distresses despairs he is disjoined i tell you from suffering stress this is the difference this the distinction this the distinguishing factor between the well instructed disciple of the noble ones and the uninstructed run of the mill person the discerning person learned doesn t sense a mental feeling of pleasure or pain this is the difference in skillfulness between the sage the person run of the mill for a learned person who has fathomed the dhamma clearly seeing this world the next desirable things don t charm the mind undesirable ones bring no resistance his acceptance rejection are scattered gone to their end do not exist knowing the dustless sorrowless state he discerns rightly has gone beyond becoming to the further shore by developing what habit what conduct what actions may man be correctly established in and arrive at the highest goal he should respect his elders and not be envious of them he should know the right time for seeing his teacher when the time is right let him go to his teacher s presence unassuming putting aside stubbornness let him keep in mind and practice what he has learned the meaning and the text of the teaching self control and the other virtues of the holy life abandoning the uttering of laughter and lamentations giving up anger fraud hypocrisy longing conceit violence harshness moral taints and infatuation let him live without pride self controlled understanding is essential for listening to a well spoken word learning and understanding are essential to meditation but a man who is hasty and heedless does not increase his wisdom and learning those who are devoted to the dhamma made known by the noble ones ariya are unsurpassed in speech thought and action they are established in peace gentleness and concentration and have reached the essence of learning and wisdom there are these four ways of answering questions which four there are questions that should be answered categorically straightforwardly yes no this that there are questions that should be answered with an analytical qualified answer defining or redefining the terms there are questions that should be answered with a counter question there are questions that should be put aside these are the four ways of answering questions first the categorical answer then the qualified third the type to be counter questioned fourth the one to be set aside any monk who knows which is which in line with the dhamma is said to be skilled in the four types of questions hard to overcome hard to beat profound hard to defeat he knows what s worthwhile what s not proficient in recognizing both he rejects the worthless grasps the worthwhile he s called one who has broken through to what s worthwhile prudent wise monks there are these seven treasures which seven the treasure of conviction the treasure of virtue the treasure of conscience the treasure of concern the treasure of listening the treasure of generosity the treasure of discernment and what is the and what is the and what is the and what is the and what is the treasure of listening there is the case where a disciple of the noble ones has heard much has retained what he she has heard has stored what he she has heard whatever teachings are admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end that in their meaning and expression proclaim the holy life that is entirely complete and pure those he she has listened to often retained discussed accumulated examined with his her mind and well penetrated in terms of his her views this is called the treasure of listening and what is the and what is the these monks are the seven treasures the treasure of conviction the treasure of virtue the treasure of conscience concern the treasure of listening generosity discernment as the seventh treasure whoever man or woman has these treasures is said not to be poor has not lived in vain so conviction virtue confidence dhamma vision should be cultivated by the wise remembering the buddhas instruction jtb ag calls this sutta iii i follow pts numbering and call it iii monks these any action performed with greed born of greed caused by greed originating from greed wherever one s selfhood turns up there that action will ripen where that action ripens there one will experience its fruit either in this very life that has arisen or further along in the sequence any action performed with aversion born of aversion caused by aversion originating from aversion wherever one s selfhood turns up there that action will ripen where that action ripens there one will experience its fruit either in this very life that has arisen or further along in the sequence any action performed with delusion born of delusion caused by delusion originating from delusion wherever one s selfhood turns up there that action will ripen where that action ripens there one will experience its fruit either in this very life that has arisen or further along in the sequence these are three causes for the origination of actions now these three are further causes for the origination of actions which three non greed is a cause for the origination of actions non aversion is a cause for the origination of actions non delusion is a cause for the origination of actions any action performed with non greed born of non greed caused by non greed originating from non greed when greed is gone that action is thus abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising any action performed with non aversion born of non aversion caused by non aversion originating from non aversion when aversion is gone that action is thus abandoned destroyed at the root made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising any action performed with non delusion born of non delusion caused by non delusion originating from non delusion when delusion is gone that action is thus abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising just as when seeds are not broken not rotten not damaged by wind heat capable of sprouting well buried planted in well prepared soil and a man would burn them with fire and burning them with fire would make them into fine ashes having made them into fine ashes he would winnow them before a high wind or wash them away in a swift flowing stream those seeds would thus be destroyed at the root made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising in the same way any action performed with non greed performed with non aversion performed with non delusion born of non delusion caused by non delusion originating from non delusion when delusion is gone that action is thus abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising these monks are three causes for the origination of action a person unknowing the actions performed by him born of greed born of aversion born of delusion whether many or few are experienced right here no other ground is found a brahman the buddha a monk endowed with a monk endowed with six qualities is capable of realizing the unexcelled cooled state which six there is the case where a monk reins in his mind when it should be reined in he exerts his mind when it should be exerted he gladdens his mind when it should be gladdened he watches over his mind when it should be watched over he is intent on what is exquisite and he delights in unbinding a monk endowed with these six qualities is capable of realizing the unexcelled cooled state i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near yes master gotama sometimes friends colleagues relatives kinsmen come to me as guests and what do you think do you serve them with staple non staple foods delicacies yes sometimes i serve them with staple non staple foods delicacies and if they don t accept them to whom do those foods belong if they don t accept them master gotama those foods are all mine in the same way brahman that with which you have insulted me who is not insulting that with which you have taunted me who is not taunting that with which you have berated me who is not berating that i don t accept from you it s all yours brahman it s all yours whoever returns insult to one who is insulting returns taunts to one who is taunting returns a berating to one who is berating is said to be eating together sharing company with that person but i am neither eating together nor sharing your company brahman it s all yours it s all yours the king together with his court know this of master gotama gotama the contemplative is an arahant and yet still master gotama gets angry when this was said the brahman akkosaka bharadvaja said to the blessed one the buddha at savatthi for a monk practicing the dhamma in accordance with the dhamma what accords with the dhamma is this that he keep focused on not self with regard to form that he keep focused on not self with regard to feeling that he keep focused on not self with regard to perception that he keep focused on not self with regard to fabrications that he keep focused on not self with regard to consciousness as he keeps focusing on not self with regard to form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he comprehends form feeling perception fabrications consciousness as he comprehends form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he is totally released from form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he is totally released from sorrows lamentations pains distresses despairs he is totally released i tell you from suffering stress then yes ananda he could but how lord could a monk have an attainment of concentration such that he would neither be percipient of earth with regard to earth nor of the next world with regard to the next world and yet he would still be percipient there is the case ananda where the monk would be percipient in this way this is peace this is exquisite the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation unbinding it s in this way that a monk could have an attainment of concentration such that he would neither be percipient of earth with regard to earth nor of water with regard to water nor of fire wind the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor non perception this world nor of the next world with regard to the next world and yet he would still be percipient at savatthi monks remain with your minds well established in the four establishings of mindfulness don t let the deathless be lost to you in which four there is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in of itself ardent alert mindful subduing greed distress with reference to the world he remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in of themselves ardent alert mindful subduing greed distress with reference to the world monks remain with your minds well established in these four establishings of mindfulness don t let the deathless be lost to you just as of all trees the balsam is foremost in terms of softness and pliancy in the same way i don t envision a single thing that when developed cultivated is as soft pliant as the mind the mind when developed cultivated is soft pliant i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in then the blessed one emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the meeting hall and on arrival sat down on a seat made ready as he was sitting there he addressed the monks for what topic are you gathered together here and what was the discussion that came to no conclusion just now lord after the meal on returning from our alms round we gathered at the meeting hall when this discussion arose isn t it amazing friends isn t it astounding the extent to which mindfulness immersed in the body when developed pursued is said by the blessed one who knows who sees the worthy one rightly self awakened to be of great fruit great benefit this was the discussion that had come to no conclusion when the blessed one arrived the blessed one said and how is mindfulness immersed in the body developed how is it pursued so as to be of great fruit great benefit breathing in long he discerns i am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns i am breathing out long or breathing in short he discerns i am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns i am breathing out short he trains himself i will breathe in sensitive to the entire body he trains himself i will breathe out sensitive to the entire body he trains himself i will breathe in calming bodily fabrication he trains himself i will breathe out calming bodily fabrication and as he remains thus heedful ardent resolute any memories resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers settles inwardly grows unified centered this is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body furthermore when walking the monk discerns i am walking when standing he discerns i am standing when sitting he discerns i am sitting when lying down he discerns i am lying down or however his body is disposed that is how he discerns it and as he remains thus heedful ardent resolute any memories resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers settles inwardly grows unified centered this is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body furthermore when going forward returning he makes himself fully alert when looking toward looking away when bending extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe his bowl when eating drinking chewing savoring when urinating defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking remaining silent he makes himself fully alert and as he remains thus heedful ardent resolute any memories resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers settles inwardly grows unified centered this is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body furthermore the monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up from the crown of the head on down surrounded by skin and full of various kinds of unclean things in this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small intestines gorge feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears skin oil saliva mucus fluid in the joints urine furthermore the monk contemplates this very body however it stands however it is disposed in terms of properties in this body there is the earth property the liquid property the fire property the wind property furthermore as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground one day two days three days dead bloated livid festering he applies it to this very body this body too such is its nature such is its future such its unavoidable fate or again as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground picked at by crows vultures hawks by dogs hyenas various other creatures a skeleton smeared with flesh blood connected with tendons a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood connected with tendons a skeleton without flesh or blood connected with tendons bones detached from their tendons scattered in all directions here a hand bone there a foot bone here a shin bone there a thigh bone here a hip bone there a back bone here a rib there a breast bone here a shoulder bone there a neck bone here a jaw bone there a tooth here a skull the bones whitened somewhat like the color of shells piled up more than a year old decomposed into a powder he applies it to this very body this body too such is its nature such is its future such its unavoidable fate and as he remains thus heedful ardent resolute any memories resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers settles inwardly grows unified centered this is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body the four jhanas furthermore quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation he permeates pervades suffuses fills this very body with the rapture pleasure born from withdrawal and furthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance he permeates pervades suffuses fills this very body with the rapture pleasure born of composure and furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding he permeates pervades suffuses fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture and furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress he enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain he sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awareness and as he remains thus heedful ardent resolute any memories resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers settles inwardly grows unified centered this is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body fullness of mind monks whoever develops pursues mindfulness immersed in the body encompasses whatever skillful qualities are on the side of clear knowing just as whoever pervades the great ocean with his awareness encompasses whatever rivulets flow down into the ocean in the same way whoever develops pursues mindfulness immersed in the body encompasses

with their kamma through the ending of the mental effluents he remains in the effluent free awareness release discernment release having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here now monks for one in whom mindfulness immersed in the body is cultivated developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated well undertaken these ten benefits can be expected that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion the blessed one was instructing urging rousing encouraging the monks with dhamma talk concerned with unbinding the monks receptive attentive focusing their entire awareness lending ear listened to the dhamma then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed one who is dependent has wavering one who is independent has no wavering there being no wavering there is calm there being calm there is no yearning there being no yearning there is no coming or going there being no coming or going there is no passing away or arising there being no passing away or arising there is neither a here nor a there nor a between the two this just this is the end of stress see also on one occasion ven sariputta and ven maha kotthita were staying near varanasi in the game refuge at isipatana then in the evening ven maha kotthita emerged from his seclusion and went to ven sariputta and exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to ven sariputta now then friend sariputta does the tathagata exist after death that friend has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata exists after death well then friend sariputta does the tathagata not exist after death friend that too has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata does not exist after death then does the tathagata both exist and not exist after death that has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death well then does the tathagata neither exist nor not exist after death that too has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death now friend sariputta when asked if the tathagata exists after death you say that has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata exists after death when asked if the tathagata does not exist after death both exists and does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death you say that too has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death now what is the cause what is the reason why that has not been declared by the blessed one for one whose passion for form has not been removed whose desire affection thirst fever craving for form has not been removed there occurs the thought the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death for one whose passion for feeling has not been removed for one whose passion for perception has not been removed for one whose passion for fabrications has not been removed for one whose passion for consciousness has not been removed whose desire affection thirst fever craving for consciousness has not been removed there occurs the thought the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death but for one whose passion for form has been removed whose desire affection thirst fever craving for form has been removed the thought the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death doesn t occur for one whose passion for feeling has been removed for one whose passion for perception has been removed for one whose passion for fabrications has been removed for one whose passion for consciousness has been removed whose desire affection thirst fever craving for consciousness has been removed the thought the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death doesn t occur this is the cause this is the reason why that has not been declared by the blessed one at savatthi as he was standing to one side pa calacanda the deva s son recited this verse in the blessed one s presence truly in a confining place he found an opening the one of extensive wisdom the awakened one who awakened to jhana the buddha and how is a monk consummate in beauty there is the case where a monk is virtuous he dwells restrained in accordance with the patimokkha consummate in his behavior sphere of activity he trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest fault this is how a monk is consummate in beauty and how is a monk consummate in strength there is the case where a monk keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities he is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities this is how a monk is consummate in strength and how is a monk consummate in speed there is the case where a monk discerns as it actually is present that this is stress he discerns as it actually is present that this is the origination of stress he discerns as it actually is present that this is the cessation of stress he discerns as it actually is present that this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress this is how a monk is consummate in speed endowed with these three qualities is a monk worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect an unexcelled field of merit for the world on one occasion ven sabhiya kaccana was staying at vaccha that has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata exists after death well then master kaccana does the tathagata not exist after death vaccha that too has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata does not exist after death then does the tathagata both exist and not exist after death that has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death well then does the tathagata neither exist nor not exist after death that too has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death now master kaccana when asked if the tathagata exists after death you say that has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata exists after death when asked if the tathagata does not exist after death you say that too has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata does not exist after death when asked if the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death you say that has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death when asked if the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death you say that too has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death now what is the cause what is the reason why that has not been declared by gotama the contemplative vaccha whatever cause whatever reason there would be for describing him as possessed of form or formless or percipient or non percipient or neither percipient nor non percipient if that cause that reason were to cease totally everywhere totally in every way without remainder then describing him by what means would one describe him as possessed of form or formless or percipient or non percipient or neither percipient nor non percipient how long has it been since you went forth master kaccana not long my friend three years whoever has gained just this much in this much time has gained a great deal my friend to say nothing of the things he has thus gone beyond thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living near savatthi at jetavana at anathapindika s monastery now when the night was far advanced a certain deity whose surpassing radiance illuminated the whole of jetavana approached the blessed one respectfully saluted him and stood beside him standing thus he addressed the blessed one in verse many deities and men longing for happiness have pondered on the question of blessings pray tell me what the highest blessings are not to associate with the foolish but to associate with the wise and to honor those worthy of honor this is the highest blessing to reside in a suitable locality to have performed meritorious actions in the past and to set oneself in the right direction this is the highest blessing vast learning skill in handicrafts well grounded in discipline and pleasant speech this is the highest blessing to support one s father and mother to cherish one s wife and children and to be engaged in peaceful occupations this is the highest blessing liberality righteous conduct rendering assistance to relatives and performance of blameless deeds this is the highest blessing to cease and abstain from evil to abstain from intoxicating drinks and diligent in performing righteous acts this is the highest blessing reverence humility contentment gratitude and the timely hearing of the dhamma the teaching of the buddha this is the highest blessing patience obedience meeting the samanas holy men and timely discussions on the dhamma this is the highest blessing self control chastity comprehension of the noble truths and the realization of nibbana this is the highest blessing the mind that is not touched by the vicissitudes of life those who have fulfilled the conditions for such blessings are victorious everywhere and attain happiness everywhere to them these are the highest blessings i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery there he addressed the monks monks yes lord the monks responded to him the blessed one said when dabba mallaputta rose up into the air and sitting cross legged in the sky in space entered emerged from the fire property and was totally unbound his body burned and was consumed so that neither ashes nor soot could be discerned just as when ghee or oil is burned and consumed neither ashes nor soot can be discerned in the same way when dabba mallaputta rose up into the air and sitting cross legged in the sky in space entered emerged from the fire property and was totally unbound his body burned and was consumed so that neither ashes nor soot could be discerned then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed just as the destination of a glowing fire struck with a blacksmith s iron hammer gradually growing calm isn t known see also i have made this parable tissa to help you to understand this is the explanation the man who does not know his way denotes the worldling so said the blessed one and the venerable tissa was cheered by his words i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery now at that time the blessed one was worshipped revered honored venerated and given homage a recipient of robes alms food lodgings medicinal requisites for the sick the community of monks was also worshipped revered honored venerated and given homage a recipient of robes alms food lodgings medicinal requisites for the sick but the wanderers of other sects were not worshipped revered honored venerated or given homage nor were they recipients of robes alms food lodgings or medicinal requisites for the sick so the wanderers of other sects unable to stand the veneration given to the blessed one and the community of monks went to sundar the female wanderer and on arrival said to her sundar would you dare to do something for the benefit of your kinsmen what shall i do masters what can i in that case sister go often to jeta s grove responding as you say masters to those wanderers of other sects sundar the female wanderer went often to jeta s grove when the wanderers of other sects knew that many people had seen sundar the female wanderer going often to jeta s grove then having murdered her and buried her right there in the moat ditch surrounding jeta s grove they went to king pasenadi kosala and on arrival said to him great king we can t find sundar the female wanderer but where do you suspect she is at jeta s grove great king then in that case search jeta s grove then those wanderers of other sects having searched jeta s grove having dug up what they had buried in the surrounding moat ditch having mounted it on a litter took it into s vatth and went from street to street crossroad to crossroad stirring up people s indignation see masters the handiwork of the sakyan son contemplatives they re shameless these sakyan son contemplatives unvirtuous evil natured liars unholy though they claim to be practicing the dhamma practicing what is harmonious practicing the holy life speakers of the truth virtuous fine natured they have no quality of a contemplative no holy quality destroyed is their quality of a contemplative destroyed is their holy quality from where is their quality of a contemplative from where their holy quality gone are they from any quality of a contemplative gone from any holy quality how can a man having done a man s business with a woman take her life so on that occasion people seeing monks in s vatth would insult revile irritate harass them with discourteous abusive language they re shameless these sakyan son contemplatives unvirtuous evil natured liars unholy though they claim to be practicing the dhamma practicing what is harmonious practicing the holy life speakers of the truth virtuous fine natured they have no quality of a contemplative no holy quality destroyed is their quality of a contemplative destroyed is their holy quality from where is their quality of a contemplative from where their holy quality gone are they from any quality of a contemplative gone from any holy quality how can a man having done a man s business with a woman take her life then early in the morning a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and carrying their bowls robes went into s vatth for alms then having gone for alms in s vatth after the meal returning from their alms round they went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they said to the blessed one at present lord people seeing monks in s vatth insult revile irritate harass them with discourteous abusive language they re shameless these sakyan son contemplatives unvirtuous evil natured liars unholy how can a man having done a man s business with a woman take her life monks this noise will not last long it will last only seven days with the passing of seven days it will disappear so in that case when those people on seeing monks insult revile irritate harass them with discourteous abusive language counter their accusation with this verse he goes to hell the one who asserts what didn t take place as does the one who having done says i didn t both low acting people there become equal after death in the world beyond so having learned this verse in the blessed one s presence the monks whenever people on seeing monks in s vatth insulted reviled irritated harassed them with discourteous abusive language countered the accusation with this verse he goes to hell the one who asserts what didn t take place as does the one who having done says i didn t both low acting people there become equal after death in the world beyond the thought occurred to those people they re innocent these sakyan son contemplatives it wasn t done by them they re taking an oath these sakyan son contemplatives then a large number of monks went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they said to him it s amazing lord it s astounding how well said that was by the blessed one monks this noise will not last long it will last only seven days with the passing of seven days it will disappear lord that noise has disappeared then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed they stab with their words people unrestrained as they do with arrows a tusker gone into battle once monks a battle between the devas asuras was in full swing and in that battle the asuras won and the devas lost having lost the devas simply fled while the asuras heading north attacked them then the thought occurred to the devas the asuras are still attacking why don t we do battle a second time so the devas did battle with the asuras a second time and a second time the asuras won and the devas lost having lost the devas simply fled while the asuras heading north attacked them then the thought occurred to the devas the asuras are still attacking why don t we do battle a third time so the devas did battle with the asuras a third time and a third time the asuras won and the devas lost having lost the devas afraid entered the deva capital having gone to their capital the devas thought having come to this shelter for the fearful we will now keep here to ourselves having nothing to do with the asuras and the asuras also thought having gone to this shelter for the fearful the devas will now keep here to themselves having nothing to do with us once monks a battle between the devas asuras was in full swing and in that battle the devas won and the asuras lost having lost the asuras simply fled while the devas heading south attacked them then the thought occurred to the asura the devas are still attacking why don t we do battle a second time so the asuras did battle with the devas a second time and a second time the devas won and the asuras lost having lost the asuras simply fled while the devas heading south attacked them then the thought occurred to the asuras the devas are still attacking why don t we do battle a third time so the asuras did battle with the devas a third time and a third time the devas won and the asuras lost having lost the asuras afraid entered the asura capital having gone to their capital the asuras thought having come to this shelter for the fearful we will now keep here to ourselves having nothing to do with the devas and the devas also thought having gone to this shelter for the fearful the asuras will now keep here to themselves having nothing to do with us in the same way monks on whatever occasion a monk secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities enters the first jh na rapture pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought evaluation on that occasion the thought occurs to him having come to this shelter for the fearful i will now keep here to myself having nothing to do with m ra and the thought occurs to m ra the evil one having gone to this shelter for the fearful the monk will now keep here to himself having nothing to do with me similarly with the second third fourth jh nas on whatever occasion a monk with the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving infinite space enters the dimension of the infinitude of space he is said to be a monk who has put m ra in the dark similarly with the dimensions of the infinitude of consciousness nothingness and neither perception nor non perception on whatever occasion with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception he enters remains in the cessation of perception feeling and having seen that with discernment his effluents are completely ended he is said to be a monk who has put m ra in the dark having bound m ra s eyes and leaving no opening he has become invisible to the evil one having crossed over attachment in the cosmos thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living near savatthi at jetavana at anathapindika s monastery then in the forenoon the blessed one having dressed himself took bowl and double robe and entered the city of savatthi for alms now at that time a fire was burning and an offering was being prepared in the house of the brahman aggikabharadvaja then the blessed one while on his alms round came to the brahman s residence the brahman seeing the blessed one some way off said this stay there you shaveling stay there you wretched monk stay there you outcast when he spoke thus the blessed one said to the brahman do you know brahman who an outcast is and what the conditions are that make an outcast no indeed venerable gotama i do not know who an outcast is nor the conditions that make an outcast it is good if venerable gotama were to explain the dhamma to me so that i may know who an outcast is and what the conditions are that make an outcast listen then brahman and pay attention i will speak yes venerable sir replied the brahman whosoever is angry harbors hatred and is reluctant to speak well of others discredits the good of others perverted in views deceitful know him as an outcast whosoever in this world kills living beings once born or twice born whosoever destroys and besieges villages and hamlets and becomes notorious as an oppressor know him as an outcast be it in the village or in the forest whosoever steals what belongs to others what is not given to him know him as an outcast whosoever having actually incurred a debt runs away when he is pressed to pay saying i owe no debt to you know him as an outcast whosoever coveting anything kills a person going along the road and grabs whatever that person has know him as an outcast he who for his own sake or for the sake of others or for the sake of wealth utters lies when questioned as a witness know him as an outcast whosoever by force or with consent associates with the wives of relatives or friends know him as an outcast whosoever being wealthy supports not his mother and father who have grown old know him as an outcast whosoever strikes and annoys by harsh speech mother father brother sister or mother in law or father in law know him as an outcast whosoever when questioned about what is good says what is detrimental and talks in an evasive manner know him as an outcast whosoever having committed an evil deed wishes that it may not be known to others and commits evil in secret know him as an outcast whosoever having gone to another s house and partaken of choice food does not honor that host by offering food when he repays the visit know him as an outcast whosoever deceives by uttering lies a brahman or an ascetic or any other mendicant know him as an outcast whosoever when a brahman or ascetic appears during mealtime angers him by harsh speech and does not offer him any alms know him as an outcast whosoever in this world shrouded in ignorance speaks harsh words whosoever debased by his pride exalts himself and belittles other know him as an outcast whosoever is given to anger is miserly has base desires and is selfish deceitful shameless and fearless in doing evil know him as an outcast whosoever reviles the enlightened one the buddha or a disciple of the buddha recluse or a householder know him as an outcast whosoever not being an arahant a consummate one pretends to be so is a thief in the whole universe he is the lowest of outcasts not by birth is one an outcast not by birth is one a brahman by deed one becomes an outcast by deed one becomes a brahman know ye by the example i now cite the fact that by birth one is not an outcast there was an outcast s son sopaka who became known as matanga this matanga attained the highest fame so difficult to gain many were the warriors mounting the celestial chariot the noble eightfold path and driving along the passion free high road sopaka now a monk reached the brahma realm having given up sense desires his lowly birth did not prevent him from being reborn in the brahma realm there are brahmans born in the family of preceptors kinsmen of veda hymns they are often seen committing evil deeds in this life itself they are despised in the next they are born in an evil state of existence high birth does not prevent them from falling into a woeful state or from censure not by birth is one an outcast not by birth is one a brahman by deed one becomes an outcast by deed one becomes an brahman when the buddha had thus spoken the brahman aggikabharadvaja said to the blessed one excellent o venerable gotama excellent just as o venerable gotama a man were to set upright what had been overturned or were to reveal what had been hidden or were to point the way to one who had gone astray or were to hold an oil lamp in the dark so that those with eyes may see things even so in many ways has the venerable gotama expounded the dhamma the doctrine i take refuge in the venerable gotama the dhamma and the sangha the order may the venerable gotama accept me as a lay follower who has taken refuge from this day onwards while life lasts at now as long as i did not have direct knowledge of the fourfold round with regard to these five clinging aggregates i did not claim to have directly awakened to the unexcelled right self awakening in this cosmos with its devas maras brahmas in this generation with its brahmans contemplatives its royalty common people but when i did have direct knowledge of the fourfold round with regard to these five clinging aggregates then i did claim to have directly awakened to the unexcelled right self awakening in this cosmos with its devas maras brahmas in this generation with its brahmans contemplatives its royalty common people the fourfold round in what way i had direct knowledge of form of the origination of form of the cessation of form of the path of practice leading to the cessation of form i had direct knowledge of feeling i had direct knowledge of perception i had direct knowledge of fabrications i had direct knowledge of consciousness of the origination of consciousness of the cessation of consciousness of the path of practice leading to the cessation of consciousness for any brahmans or contemplatives who by directly knowing form in this way directly knowing the origination of form in this way directly knowing the cessation of form in this way directly knowing the path of practice leading to the cessation of form in this way are practicing for disenchantment dispassion cessation with regard to form they are practicing rightly those who are practicing rightly are firmly based in this doctrine discipline and any brahmans or contemplatives who by directly knowing form in this way directly knowing the origination of form in this way directly knowing the cessation of form in this way directly knowing the path of practice leading to the cessation of form in this way are from disenchantment dispassion cessation lack of clinging sustenance with regard to form released they are well released those who are well released are fully accomplished and with those who are fully accomplished there is no cycle for the sake of describing them and what is feeling these and what is perception these six classes of perception perception of form perception of sound perception of smell perception of taste perception of tactile sensation perception of ideas this is called perception from the origination of contact comes the origination of perception from the cessation of contact comes the cessation of perception and just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of perception and what are fabrications these six classes of intention intention with regard to form intention with regard to sound intention with regard to smell intention with regard to taste intention with regard to tactile sensation intention with regard to ideas these are called fabrications from the origination of contact comes the origination of fabrications from the cessation of contact comes the cessation of fabrications and just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of fabrications and what is consciousness these six classes of consciousness eye consciousness ear consciousness nose consciousness tongue consciousness body consciousness intellect consciousness this is called consciousness from the origination of name form comes the origination of consciousness from the cessation of name form comes the cessation of consciousness and just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of consciousness i e right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration for any brahmans or contemplatives who by directly knowing consciousness in this way directly knowing the origination of consciousness in this way directly knowing the cessation of consciousness in this way directly knowing the path of practice leading to the cessation of consciousness in this way are practicing for disenchantment dispassion cessation with regard to consciousness they are practicing rightly those who are practicing rightly are firmly based in this doctrine discipline and any brahmans or

are well released those who are well released are fully accomplished and with those who are fully accomplished there is no cycle for the sake of describing them i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one on a wandering tour among the so the brahmans householders of thullakotthita went to the blessed one on arrival some of them bowed down to the blessed one and sat to one side some of them

side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one i have received my parents permission lord to go forth from the household life into homelessness may the blessed one give me the going forth then ratthapala the clansman obtained the going forth in the blessed one s presence he obtained admission and not long after his admission one half month after his admission the blessed one having stayed at thullakotthita as long as he liked set out wandering to savatthi wandering by stages he eventually arrived at savatthi there he lived at savatthi in jeta s grove anathapindika s monastery as for ven ratthapala dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent resolute he in no long time reached remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing realizing it for himself in the here now he knew birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for the sake of this world and thus ven ratthapala became another one of the arahants then ven ratthapala went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one lord i want to visit my parents if you give me permission then the blessed one encompassing ven ratthapala s awareness with his awareness considered understood ven ratthapala is incapable of leaving the training and reverting to the lower life so he said to him now is the time ratthapala for you to do as you see fit then ven ratthapala rising from his seat bowing down to the blessed one and keeping him on his right departed putting his lodgings in order and carrying his bowl robes set out wandering toward thullakotthita wandering by stages he eventually arrived at thullakotthita there he stayed in thullakotthita in now at that time ven ratthapala s father was in the middle door porch having his hair combed he saw ven ratthapala coming from afar and on seeing him said it was by these shaven headed contemplatives that our only son dear appealing was made to go forth so ven ratthapala instead of receiving a gift or a polite refusal at his own father s house got nothing but abuse just then a slavewoman belonging to one of his relatives was about to throw away some day old porridge so ven ratthapala said to her sister if that is to be thrown away pour it here into my bowl while she was pouring the day old porridge into this bowl she recognized his hands feet voice so she went to his mother and said may it please you to know my lady that master son ratthapala has arrived hey if what you say is true i give you your freedom then ven ratthapala s mother went to his father and said may it please you to know householder that they say the clansman ratthapala has arrived now at that time ven ratthapala was sitting by a wall eating the day old porridge his father went to him and said ratthapala my dear isn t there what you re eating day old porridge don t you have your own home to go to how could we have a home householder we have gone forth from the household life into homelessness we are homeless householder we went to your house but instead of receiving a gift or a polite refusal we got nothing but abuse come dear ratthapala let s go home enough householder my meal for today is finished in that case dear ratthapala acquiesce to the meal for tomorrow so ven ratthapala acquiesced in silence understanding ven ratthapala s acquiesence his father went to his house and having the floor coated with fresh cow dung had a great heap of gold silver made two great heaps made one of gold one of silver so large that a man standing on the near side could not see a man standing on the far side just as a man standing on the far side could not see a man standing on the near hiding them behind screens he set out a seat between them surrounded by a curtain then as the night was ending ven ratthapala s father had exquisite staple non staple foods prepared in his own house and had the time announced to ven ratthapala it s time dear ratthapala the meal is ready then early in the morning putting on his under robe and carrying his bowl robes ven ratthapala went to his father s house and on arrival sat down on the seat made ready then his father revealing the heap of gold silver said to him this my dear ratthapala is your mother s inheritance the other is your fathers the other your grandfather s enough that you can enjoy wealth and make merit come my dear ratthapala leave the training and revert to the lower life enjoy wealth and make merit householder if you d do as i say you would have this heap of gold silver loaded on carts and hauled away to be dumped midstream in the river ganges why is that this wealth will be the cause of your sorrow lamentation pain distress despair then clasping each of his feet ven ratthapala s former wives said to him what are they like dear master son those nymphs for whose sake you lead the holy life sisters we don t lead the holy life for the sake of nymphs sisters he calls us and they fell down right there in a faint then ven ratthapala said to his father householder if there s food to be given then give it don t harass us eat then my dear ratthapala the meal is ready so with his own hands ven ratthapala s father served and satisfied him with exquisite staple and non staple foods when he had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl ven ratthapala stood up and recited these verses look at the image beautified a heap of festering wounds shored up ill but the object of many resolves where there is nothing lasting or sure after reciting these verses while standing ven ratthapala went to king koravya s migacira on arrival he sat down in the shade of a tree for the day s abiding then as you say your majesty the gamekeeper responded to the king as he was cleaning up migacira he saw ven ratthapala sitting in the shade of a tree for the day s abiding on seeing him he went to the king and said migacira has been cleaned up for you your majesty and the clansman ratthapala the son of the leading clan in this thullakotthita of whom you have often spoken highly is there sitting in the shade of a tree for the day s abiding in that case my dear gamekeeper never mind about the pleasure garden for today i am now going to pay my respects to that master ratthapala then saying give away all the staple and non staple foods that have been prepared king koravya had auspicious vehicles harnessed mounting an auspicious vehicle he set out from thullakotthita accompanied by other auspicious vehicles in full royal pomp to see ven ratthapala going as far by vehicle as the ground would permit he dismounted and went to ven ratthapala accompanied by many eminent members of his court on arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with ven ratthapala after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he stood to one side as he was standing there he said to ven ratthapala may master ratthapala sit here on the elephant rug never mind great king you sit there i am sitting on my own seat so king koravya sat down on the seat prepared as he was sitting there he said to ven ratthapala there are cases where having suffered these four kinds of loss men shave off their hair beard put on the ochre robe and go forth from the home life into homelessness which four loss through aging loss through illness loss of wealth loss of relatives but master ratthapala has suffered none of these what did he know or see or hear that master ratthapala went forth from the home life into homelessness great king there are four dhamma summaries stated by the blessed one who knows sees worthy rightly self awakened having known seen heard them i went forth from the home life into homelessness which four the world the world is without shelter without protector this is the second dhamma summary the world is without ownership one has to pass on leaving everything behind this is the third dhamma summary the world is insufficient insatiable a slave to craving this is the fourth dhamma summary these great king are the four dhamma summaries stated by the blessed one who knows sees worthy rightly self awakened having known seen heard them i went forth from the home life into homelessness master ratthapala you say the world is swept away it does not endure now how is the meaning of this statement to be understood what do you think great king when you were twenty or twenty five years old an expert elephant rider an expert horseman an expert charioteer an expert archer an expert swordsman were you strong in arm strong in thigh fit seasoned in warfare yes master ratthapala when i was twenty or twenty five years old i was strong in arm strong in thigh fit seasoned in warfare it was as if i had supernormal power i do not see anyone who was my equal in strength and what do you think great king are you even now as strong in arm strong in thigh as fit as seasoned in warfare not at all master ratthapala i m now a feeble old man aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life years old sometimes thinking i will place my foot here i place it somewhere else it was in reference to this great king that the blessed one who knows sees worthy rightly self awakened said the world is swept away it does not endure having known seen heard this i went forth from the home life into homelessness it s amazing master ratthapala it s astounding how well that has been said by the blessed one who knows sees worthy rightly self awakened the world is swept away it does not endure for the world really is swept away master ratthapala it does not endure now in this royal court there are elephant troops cavalry chariot troops infantry that will serve to defend us from dangers and yet you say the world is without shelter without protector how is the meaning of this statement to be understood what do you think great king do you have any recurring illness yes master ratthapala i have a recurring wind illness and what do you think great king can you say to your friends advisors relatives blood kinsmen my friends advisors relatives blood kinsmen are commanded all of you who are present share out this pain so that i may feel less pain or do you have to feel that pain all alone oh no master ratthapala i can t say to my friends advisors relatives blood kinsmen all of you who are present share out this pain so that i may feel less pain i have to feel that pain all alone it was in reference to this great king that the blessed one who knows sees worthy rightly self awakened said the world is without shelter without protector having known seen heard this i went forth from the home life into homelessness it s amazing master ratthapala it s astounding how well that has been said by the blessed one who knows sees worthy rightly self awakened the world is without shelter without protector for the world really is without shelter master ratthapala it is without protector now in this royal court there is a great deal of gold silver stashed away underground in attic vaults and yet you say the world is without ownership one has to pass on leaving everything behind how is the meaning of this statement to be understood what do you think great king as you now enjoy yourself endowed replete with the pleasures of the five senses can you say even in the afterlife i will enjoy myself in the same way endowed replete with the very same pleasures of the five senses or will this wealth fall to others while you pass on in accordance with your kamma oh no master ratthapala i can t say even in the afterlife i will enjoy myself in the same way endowed replete with the very same pleasures of the five senses this wealth will fall to others while i pass on in accordance with my kamma it was in reference to this great king that the blessed one who knows sees worthy rightly self awakened said the world is without ownership one has to pass on leaving everything behind having known seen heard this i went forth from the home life into homelessness it s amazing master ratthapala it s astounding how well that has been said by the blessed one who knows sees worthy rightly self awakened the world is without ownership one has to pass on leaving everything behind for the world really is without ownership master ratthapala one has to pass on leaving everything behind now master ratthapala you say the world is insufficient insatiable a slave to craving how is the meaning of this statement to be understood what do you think great king do you now rule over the prosperous country of kuru that is so master ratthapala i rule over the prosperous country of kuru what do you think great king suppose a trustworthy reliable man of yours were to come to you from the east on arrival he would say to you may it please your majesty to know i have come from the east there i saw a great country powerful prosperous populous crowded with people plenty are the elephant troops there plenty the cavalry troops chariot troops infantry troops plenty is the ivory work there plenty the gold silver both worked unworked plenty are the women for the taking it is possible with the forces you now have to conquer it conquer it great king what would you do having conquered it master ratthapala i would rule over it now what do you think great king suppose a trustworthy reliable man of yours were to come to you from the west the north the south the other side of the ocean on arrival he would say to you may it please your majesty to know i have come from the other side of the ocean there i saw a great country powerful prosperous populous crowded with people plenty are the elephant troops there plenty the cavalry troops chariot troops infantry troops plenty is the ivory work there plenty the gold silver both worked unworked plenty are the women for the taking it is possible with the forces you now have to conquer it conquer it great king what would you do having conquered it master ratthapala i would rule over it too it was in reference to this great king that the blessed one who knows sees worthy rightly self awakened said the world is insufficient insatiable a slave to craving having known seen heard this i went forth from the home life into homelessness it s amazing master ratthapala it s astounding how well that has been said by the blessed one who knows sees worthy rightly self awakened the world is insufficient insatiable a slave to craving for the world really is insufficient master ratthapala it s insatiable a slave to craving that is what ven ratthapala said having said that he further said this i see in the world people with wealth who from delusion don t make a gift of the treasure they ve gained greedy they stash it away hoping for even more sensual pleasures a king who by force has conquered the world and rules over the earth to the edge of the sea dissatisfied with the ocean s near shore longs for the ocean s far shore as well kings others plenty of people go to death with craving unabated unsated they leave the body behind having not had enough of the world s sensual pleasures one s relatives weep pull out their hair oh woe our loved one is dead they cry carrying him off wrapped in a piece of cloth they place him on a pyre then set him on fire so he burns poked with sticks in just one piece of cloth leaving all his possessions behind they are not shelters for one who has died not relatives friends or companions his heirs take over his wealth while the being goes on in line with his kamma no wealth at all follows the dead one not children wives dominion or riches long life can t be gotten with wealth nor aging warded off with treasure the wise say this life is next to nothing impermanent subject to change the rich the poor touch the touch of death the foolish wise are touched by it too but while fools lie as if slain by their folly the wise don t tremble when touched by the touch thus the discernment by which one attains to mastery is better than wealth for those who haven t reached mastery go from existence to existence out of delusion doing bad deeds one goes to a womb to the next world falling into the wandering on one thing after another while those of weak discernment trusting in one also go to a womb to the next world just as an evil thief caught at the break in is destroyed by his own act so evil people after dying in the next world are destroyed by their own acts sensual pleasures variegated enticing sweet in various ways disturb the mind seeing the drawbacks in sensual objects that s why o king i went forth just like fruits people fall young old at the break up of the body knowing this o king i went forth the contemplative life is better for sure at savatthi as he was sitting to one side three qualities of the world great king when arising arise for harm stress discomfort which three greed great king is a quality of the world that when arising arises for harm stress discomfort aversion delusion is a quality of the world that when arising arises for harm stress discomfort these are the three qualities of the world great king that when arising arise for harm stress discomfort that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further greed i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion a large number of monks after the meal on returning from their alms round were sitting gathered together at the kareri tree pavilion when this discussion arose friends an alms collecting monk so friends let s become alms collecting monks then we too while going for alms will periodically get to see agreeable sights via the eye to hear agreeable sounds via the ear to smell agreeable aromas via the nose to taste agreeable flavors via the tongue to touch agreeable tactile sensations via the body we too while going for alms will be honored respected revered venerated and given homage and this discussion came to no conclusion then the blessed one emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the kareri tree pavilion and on arrival sat down on a seat laid out seated he addressed the monks for what topic are you sitting together here and what was the discussion that came to no conclusion just now lord after the meal on returning from our alms round we were sitting gathered together here at the kareri tree pavilion when this discussion arose they repeat what had been said it isn t proper monks that sons of good families on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life should talk on such a topic when you have gathered you have two duties either dhamma talk or noble silence then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed the monk going for alms supporting himself and no other the devas adore one who is such if he s not intent on fame praise monks with the abandoning destruction of the seven obsessions the holy life is fulfilled which seven the obsession of sensual passion the obsession of resistance the obsession of views the obsession of uncertainty the obsession of conceit the obsession of passion for becoming the obsession of ignorance with the abandoning destruction of these seven obsessions the holy life is fulfilled when for a monk the obsession of sensual passion has been abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising when for him the obsession of resistance the obsession of views the obsession of uncertainty the obsession of conceit the obsession of passion for becoming the obsession of ignorance has been abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising this is called a monk who has cut through craving has turned away from the fetter and by rightly breaking through conceit has put an end to suffering stress monks speaking rightly of nanda one could say he is a son of a good family speaking rightly of nanda one could say he is strong speaking rightly of nanda one could say he is handsome speaking rightly of nanda one could say he is fiercely passionate if nanda did not guard the doors of his senses know moderation in eating be devoted to wakefulness and be endowed with mindfulness alertness how would he be able to follow the holy life complete pure this is nanda s guarding of the doors of his senses if he should look to the east he looks focusing his entire awareness thinking as i am looking thus to the east greed distress evil unskillful qualities will not flow out that s how he is alert there if he should look to the west the north the south above below to the intermediate directions he looks focusing his entire awareness thinking as i am looking thus to the intermediate directions greed distress evil unskillful qualities will not flow out that s how he is alert there this is nanda s guarding of the doors of his senses this is nanda s knowledge of moderation in eating nanda takes his food reflecting appropriately not playfully nor for intoxication nor for putting on bulk nor for beautification but simply for the survival continuance of this body for ending its afflictions for the support of the holy life thinking i will destroy old feelings of hunger not create new feelings from overeating thus i will maintain myself be blameless live in comfort this is nanda s knowledge of moderation in eating this is nanda s devotion to wakefulness there is the case where nanda during the day sitting pacing back forth cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check during the first watch of the night this is nanda s being in mindfulness alertness there is the case where feelings are known to nanda as they arise known as they persist known as they subside perceptions are known as they arise known as they persist known as they subside thoughts are known as they arise known as they persist known as they subside this is nanda s being in mindfulness alertness monks if nanda did not guard the doors of his senses know moderation in eating be devoted to wakefulness and be endowed with mindfulness alertness how would he be able to follow the holy life complete pure furthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters remains in the second jhana the third jhana the fourth jhana the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor non perception he remains touching with his body in whatever way there is an opening there it is to this extent that one is described by the blessed one as a bodily witness though with a sequel furthermore with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception he enters remains in the cessation of perception feeling and as he sees with discernment the mental fermentations go to their total end he remains touching with his body in whatever way there is an opening there it is to this extent that one is described by the blessed one as a bodily witness without a sequel monks i shall point out the nearest shore and the farthest shore just so venerable one the monks assented to the blessed one what monks is the nearest shore what is the farthest shore wrong view is the nearest shore right view is the farthest shore wrong intention is the nearest shore right intention is the farthest shore this monks is the nearest shore this is the farthest shore amongst humans very few are they those mortals going to the farthest shore rather the rest of humankind runs just along this shore those who indeed practise in the dhamma in the well taught dhamma they are mortals who will go beyond the sway of death so difficult to escape renouncing the dark qualities the wise person should cultivate the bright now on that occasion the blessed one was dwelling in then the thought occurred to the blessed one these thirty monks from pava are all still with fetters what if i were to teach them the dhamma in such a way that in this very sitting their minds through lack of clinging would be released from fermentations so he addressed the monks monks yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said from an inconceivable beginning comes transmigration a beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating wandering on what do you think monks which is greater the blood you have shed from having your heads cut off while transmigrating wandering this long long time or the water in the four great oceans as we understand the dhamma taught to us by the blessed one this is the greater the blood we have shed from having our heads cut off while transmigrating wandering this long long time not the water in the four great oceans excellent monks excellent it is excellent that you thus understand the dhamma taught by me this is the greater the blood you have shed from having your heads cut off while transmigrating wandering this long long time not the water in the four great oceans the blood you have shed when being cows you had your cow heads cut off long has this been greater than the water in the four great oceans the blood you have shed when being water buffaloes you had your water buffalo heads cut off when being rams you had your ram heads cut off when being goats you had your goat heads cut off when being deer you had your deer heads cut off when being chickens you had your chicken heads cut off when being pigs you had your pig heads cut off long has this been greater than the water in the four great oceans the blood you have shed when arrested as thieves plundering villages you had your heads cut off when arrested as highway thieves you had your heads cut off when arrested as adulterers you had your heads cut off long has this been greater than the water in the four great oceans why is that from an inconceivable beginning comes transmigration a beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating wandering on long have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries enough to become disenchanted with all fabrications enough to become dispassionate enough to be released that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words and while this explanation was being given the minds of the thirty monks from pava through lack of clinging were released from fermentations see also thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living at now on that occasion then when it was morning the the blessed one said sariputta the misguided man sunakkhatta is angry and his words are spoken out of anger thinking to discredit the tathagata he actually praises him for it is a praise of the tathagata to say of him when he teaches the dhamma to anyone it leads him when he practices it to the complete destruction of suffering sariputta this misguided man sunakkhatta will never infer of me according to dhamma that blessed one is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessed and he will never infer of me according to dhamma that blessed one enjoys the various kinds of supernormal power having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one he appears and vanishes he goes unhindered through a wall through an enclosure through a mountain as though through space he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth seated cross legged he travels in space like a bird with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty he wields bodily mastery even as far as the brahma world and he will never infer of me according to dhamma with the divine ear element which is purified and surpasses the human that blessed one hears both kinds of sounds the heavenly and the human those that are far as well as near and he will never infer of me according to dhamma that blessed one encompasses with his own mind the minds of other beings other persons he understands a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust he understands a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate he understands a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion he understands a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted he understands an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted he understands a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed he understands a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated he understands a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated ten powers of a tathagata sariputta the tathagata has these ten tathagata s powers possessing which he claims the herd leader s place roars his lion s roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the wheel of brahma here the tathagata understands as it actually is the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible again the tathagata understands as it actually is the results of actions undertaken past future and present with possibilities and with causes that too is a tathagata s power again the tathagata understands as it actually is the ways leading to all destinations that too is a tathagata s power again the tathagata understands as it actually is the world with its many and different elements that too is a tathagata s power again the tathagata understands as it actually is how beings have different inclinations that too is a tathagata s power again the tathagata understands as it actually is the disposition of the faculties of other beings other persons that too is a tathagata s power again the tathagata understands as it actually is the defilement the cleansing and the emergence in regard to the jhanas liberations concentrations and attainments that too is a tathagata s power again the tathagata recollects his manifold past lives that is one birth two births three births four births five births ten births twenty births thirty births forty births fifty births a hundred births a thousand births a hundred thousand births many aeons of world contraction many aeons of world expansion many aeons of world contraction and expansion there i was so named of such a clan with such an appearance such was my nutriment such my experience of pleasure and pain such my life term and passing away from there i reappeared elsewhere and there too i was so named of such a clan with such an appearance such was my nutriment such my experience of pleasure and pain such my life term and passing away from there i reappeared here thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives that too is a tathagata s power again with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human the tathagata sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and he understands how beings pass on according to their actions thus these worthy beings who were ill conducted in body speech and mind revilers of noble ones wrong in their views giving effect to wrong view in their actions on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared in a state of deprivation in a bad destination in perdition even in hell but these worthy beings who were well conducted in body speech and mind not revilers of noble ones right in their views giving effect to right view in their actions on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared in a good destination even in the heavenly world thus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human he sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and he understands how beings pass on according to their actions that too is a tathagata s power again by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge the tathagata here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints that too is a tathagata s power that a tathagata has by virtue of which he claims the herd leader s place roars his lion s roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the wheel of brahma the tathagata has these ten tathagata s powers possessing which he claims the herd leader s place roars his lion s roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the wheel of brahma sariputta when i know and see thus should anyone say of me the recluse gotama does not have any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones the recluse gotama teaches a dhamma merely hammered out by reasoning following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as surely as if he had been carried off and put there he will wind up in hell four kinds of intrepidity sariputta the tathagata has these four kinds of intrepidity possessing which he claims the herd leader s place roars his lion s roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the wheel of brahma what are the four here i see no ground on which any recluse or brahman or god or mara or brahma or anyone at all in the world could in accordance with the dhamma accuse me thus while you claim full enlightenment you are not fully enlightened in regard to certain things and seeing no ground for that i abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidity i see no ground on which any recluse or anyone at all could accuse me thus while you claim to have destroyed the taints these taints are undestroyed by you and seeing no ground for that i abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidity i see no ground on which any recluse or anyone at all could accuse me thus those things called obstructions by you are not able to obstruct one who engages in them and seeing no ground for that i abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidity i see no ground on which any recluse or anyone at all could accuse me thus when you teach the dhamma to someone it does not lead him when he practices it to the complete destruction of suffering and seeing no ground for that i abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidity a tathagata has these four kinds of intrepidity possessing which he claims the herd leader s place roars his lion s roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the wheel of brahma sariputta when i know and see thus should anyone say of me he will wind up in hell the eight assemblies sariputta there are these i recall having approached many hundred assemblies of nobles many hundred assemblies of brahmans many hundred assemblies of householders many hundred assemblies of recluses many hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the four great kings many hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the thirty three many hundred assemblies of mara s retinue many hundred assemblies of brahmas and formerly i had sat with them there and talked with them and held conversations with them yet i see no ground for thinking that fear or timidity might come upon me there and seeing no ground for that i abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidity sariputta when i know and see thus should anyone say of me he will wind up in hell four kinds of generation sariputta what is egg born generation there are these beings born by breaking out of the shell of an egg this is called egg born generation what is womb born generation there are these beings born by breaking out from the caul this is called womb born generation what is moisture born generation there are these beings born in a rotten fish in a rotten corpse in rotten dough in a cesspit or in a sewer this is called moisture born generation what is spontaneous generation there are gods and denizens of hell and certain human beings and some beings in the lower worlds this is called spontaneous generation these are the four kinds of generation sariputta when i know and see thus should anyone say of me he will wind up in hell the sariputta there are these five destinations what are the five hell the animal realm the realm of ghosts human beings and gods i understand hell and the path and way leading to hell and i also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell i understand the animal realm and the path and way leading to the animal realm and i also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in the animal realm i understand the realm of ghosts and the path and way leading to the realm of ghosts and i also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in the realm of ghosts i understand human beings and the path and way leading to the human world and i also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear among human beings i understand the gods and the path and way leading to the world of the gods and i also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world i understand nibbana and the path and way leading to nibbana and i also understand how one who has entered this path will by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints the five destinations and nibbana in detail by encompassing mind with mind i understand a certain person thus this person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell and then later on with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human i see that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell and is experiencing extremely painful racking piercing feelings suppose there were a charcoal pit deeper than a man s height full of glowing coals without flame or smoke and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same charcoal pit then a man with good sight on seeing him would say this person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that he will come to this same charcoal pit and then later on he sees that he has fallen into that charcoal pit and is experiencing extremely painful racking piercing feelings so too by encompassing mind with mind piercing feelings by encompassing mind with mind i understand a certain person thus this person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in the animal realm and then later on with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human i see that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in the animal realm and is experiencing painful racking piercing feelings suppose there were a cesspit deeper than a man s height full of filth and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same cesspit then a man with good sight on seeing him would say this person so behaves that he will come to this same cesspit and then later on he sees that he has fallen into that cesspit and is experiencing painful racking piercing feelings so too by encompassing mind with mind piercing feelings by encompassing mind with mind i understand a certain person thus this person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in the realm of ghosts and then later on i see that he has reappeared in the realm of ghosts and is experiencing much painful feeling suppose there were a tree growing on uneven ground with scanty foliage casting a dappled shade and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same tree then a man with good sight on seeing him would say this person so behaves that he will come to this same tree and then later on he sees that he is sitting or lying in the shade of that tree experiencing much painful feeling so too by encompassing mind with mind much painful feeling by encompassing mind with mind i understand a certain person thus this person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear among human beings and then later on i see that he has reappeared among human beings and is experiencing much pleasant feeling suppose there were a tree growing on even ground with thick foliage casting a deep shade and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same tree then a man with good sight on seeing him would say this person so behaves that he will come to this same tree and then later on he sees that he is sitting or lying in the shade of that tree experiencing much pleasant feeling so too by encompassing mind with mind much pleasant feeling by encompassing mind with mind i understand a certain person thus this person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world and then later on i see that he has reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world and is experiencing extremely pleasant feelings suppose there were a mansion and it had an upper chamber plastered within and without shut off secured by bars with shuttered windows and in it there was a couch spread with rugs blankets and sheets with a deerskin coverlet with a canopy as well as crimson pillows for both head and feet and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same mansion then a man with good sight on seeing him would say this person so behaves that he will come to this same mansion and later on he sees that he is sitting or lying in that upper chamber in that mansion experiencing extremely pleasant feelings so too by encompassing mind with mind extremely pleasant feelings by encompassing mind with mind i understand a certain person thus this person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge he here and now will enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints and then later on i see that by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge he here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints and is experiencing extremely pleasant feelings sariputta when i know and see thus should anyone say of me the recluse gotama does not have any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones the recluse gotama teaches a dhamma merely hammered out by reasoning following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as surely as if he had been carried off and put there he will wind up in hell just as a bhikkhu possessed of virtue concentration and wisdom would here and now enjoy final knowledge so it will happen in this case i say that unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as surely as if he had been carried off and put there he will wind up in hell the bodhisatta s austerities sariputta i recall having lived a holy life possessing four factors i have practiced asceticism the extreme of asceticism i have practiced coarseness the extreme of coarseness i have practiced scrupulousness the extreme of scrupulousness i have practiced seclusion the extreme of seclusion such was my asceticism sariputta that i went naked rejecting conventions licking my hands not coming when asked not stopping when asked i did not accept food brought or food specially made or an invitation to a meal i received nothing from a pot from a bowl across a threshold across a stick across a pestle from two eating together from a pregnant woman from a woman giving suck from a woman lying with a man from where food was advertised to be distributed from where a dog was waiting from where flies were buzzing i accepted no fish or meat i drank no liquor wine or fermented brew i kept to one house to one morsel i kept to two houses to two morsels i kept to seven houses to seven morsels i lived on one saucerful a day on two saucerfuls a day on seven saucerfuls a day i took food once a day once every two days once every seven days and so on up to once every fortnight i dwelt pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervals i was an eater of greens or millet or wild rice or hide parings or moss or ricebran or rice scum or sesamum flour or grass or cowdung i lived on forest roots and fruits i fed on fallen fruits i clothed myself in hemp in hemp mixed cloth in shrouds in refuse rags in tree bark in antelope hide in strips of antelope hide in kusa grass fabric in bark fabric in wood shavings fabric in head hair wool in animal wool in owls wings i was one who pulled out hair and beard pursuing the practice of pulling out hair and beard i was one who stood continuously rejecting seats i was one who squatted continuously devoted to maintaining the squatting position i was one who used a mattress of spikes i made a mattress of spikes my bed i dwelt pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times daily including the evening thus in such a variety of ways i dwelt pursuing the practice of tormenting and mortifying the body such was my asceticism such was my coarseness sariputta that just as the bole of a tinduka tree accumulating over the years cakes and flakes off so too dust and dirt accumulating over the years caked off my body and flaked off it never occurred to me oh let me rub this dust and dirt off with my hand or let another rub this dust and dirt off with his hand it never occurred to me thus such was my coarseness such was my scrupulousness sariputta that i was always mindful in stepping forwards and stepping backwards i was full of pity even for the beings in a drop of water thus let me not hurt the tiny creatures in the crevices of the ground such was my scrupulousness such was my seclusion sariputta that i would plunge into some forest and dwell there and when i saw a cowherd or a shepherd or someone gathering grass or sticks or a woodsman i would flee from grove to grove from thicket to thicket from hollow to hollow from hillock to hillock why was that so that they should not see me or i see them just as a forest bred deer on seeing human beings flees from grove to grove from thicket to thicket from hollow to hollow from hillock to hillock so too when i saw a cowherd or a shepherd such was my seclusion i would go on all fours to the cow pens when the cattle had gone out and the cowherd had left them and i would feed on the dung of the young suckling calves as long as my own excrement and urine lasted i fed on my own excrement and urine such was my great distortion in feeding i would plunge into some awe inspiring grove and dwell there a grove so awe inspiring that normally it would make a man s hair stand up if he were not free from lust when those cold wintry nights came during the eight days interval of frost i would dwell by night in the open and by day in the grove chilled by night and scorched by day alone in awe inspiring groves naked no fire to sit beside the sage yet pursues his quest i would make my bed in a charnel ground with the bones of the dead for a pillow and cowherd boys came up and spat on me urinated on me threw dirt at me and poked sticks into my ears yet i do not recall that i ever aroused an evil mind of hate against them such was my abiding in equanimity sariputta there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this purification comes about through food sariputta there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this purification comes about through food they say let us live on beans let us live on sesamum let us live on rice and they eat rice they eat rice powder they drink rice water and they make various kinds of rice concoctions now i recall having eaten a single rice grain a day sariputta you may think that the rice grain was bigger at that time yet you should not regard it so the rice grain was then at most the same size as now through feeding on a single rice grain a day my body reached a state of extreme emaciation because of eating so little the hair rotted at its roots fell from my body as i rubbed yet sariputta by such conduct by such practice by such performance of austerities i did not attain any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones why was that because i did not attain that noble wisdom which when attained is noble and emancipating and leads the one who practices in accordance with it to the complete destruction of suffering sariputta there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this purification comes about through the round of rebirths but it is impossible to find a realm in the round that i have not already passed through in this long journey except for the gods of the pure abodes and had i passed through the round as a god in the pure abodes i would never have returned to this world there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this purification comes about through some particular kind of rebirth but it is impossible to find a kind of rebirth that i have not been reborn in already in this long journey except for the gods of the pure abodes there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this purification comes about through some particular abode but it is impossible to find a kind of abode that i have not already dwelt in except for the gods of the pure abodes there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this purification comes about through sacrifice but it is impossible to find a kind of sacrifice that has not already been offered up by me in this long journey when i was either a head anointed noble king or a well to do brahman there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this purification comes about through fire worship but it is impossible to find a kind of fire that has not already been worshipped by me in this long journey when i was either a head anointed noble king or a well to do brahman sariputta there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this as long as this good man is still young a black haired young man endowed with the blessing of youth in the prime of life so long is he perfect in his lucid wisdom but when this good man is old aged burdened with years advanced in life and come to the last stage being eighty ninety or a hundred years old then the lucidity of his wisdom is lost but it should not be regarded so i am now old aged burdened with years advanced in life and come to the last stage my years have turned eighty now suppose that i had four disciples with a hundred years lifespan perfect in mindfulness retentiveness memory and lucidity of wisdom rightly speaking were it to be said of anyone a being not subject to delusion has appeared in the world for the welfare and happiness of many out of compassion for the world for the good welfare and happiness of gods and humans it is of me indeed that rightly speaking this should be said now on that occasion the as to that nagasamala you may remember this discourse on the dhamma as the hair raising discourse that is what the blessed one said the venerable nagasamala was satisfied and delighted in the blessed one s words that which can be attained by seers the place so hard to arrive at women are not able to reach since they lack sufficient wisdom soma replies there are o monks these three feelings pleasant feelings painful feelings and neither painful nor pleasant feelings be it a pleasant feeling be it a painful feeling be it neutral one s own or others feelings of all kinds i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in then in that case my friends come again on the next uposatha day and perhaps you ll get to hear a dhamma talk in the blessed one s presence as you say venerable sir the lay followers from campa said to ven sariputta rising from their seats bowing down to him and then circling him keeping him on their right they left then on the following uposatha day the lay followers from campa went to ven sariputta and on arrival having bowed down to him stood to one side then ven sariputta together with the lay followers from campa went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one yes sariputta there would be the case where a person gives a gift of a certain sort and it does not bear great fruit or great benefit whereas another person gives a gift of the same sort and it bears great fruit and great benefit lord what is the cause what is the reason why a person gives a gift of a certain sort and it does not bear great fruit or great benefit whereas another person gives a gift of the same sort and it bears great fruit and great benefit sariputta there is the case where a person gives a gift seeking his own profit with a mind attached to the reward seeking to store up for himself with the thought i ll enjoy this after death he gives his gift food drink clothing a vehicle a garland perfume ointment bedding shelter a lamp to a brahman or a contemplative what do you think sariputta might a person give such a gift as this yes lord having given this gift seeking his own profit with a mind attached to the reward seeking to store up for himself with the thought i ll enjoy this after death on the break up of the body after death he reappears in the company of the four great kings then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this world then there is the case of a person who gives a gift not seeking his own profit not with a mind attached to the reward not seeking to store up for himself nor with the thought i ll enjoy this after death instead he gives a gift with the thought giving is good he gives his gift food drink clothing a vehicle a garland perfume ointment bedding shelter a lamp to a brahman or a contemplative what do you think sariputta might a person give such a gift as this yes lord having given this gift with the thought giving is good on the break up of the body after death he reappears in the company of the devas of the thirty three then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this world or instead of thinking giving is good he gives a gift with the thought this was given in the past done in the past by my father grandfather it would not be right for me to let this old family custom be discontinued on the break up of the body after death he reappears in the company of the devas of the hours then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this world or instead he gives a gift with the thought i am well off these are not well off it would not be right for me being well off not to give a gift to those who are not well off on the break up of the body after death he reappears in the company of the contented devas then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this world or instead he gives a gift with the thought just as there were the great sacrifices of the sages of the past or instead he gives a gift with the thought when this gift of mine is given it makes the mind serene gratification joy arise on the break up of the body after death he reappears in the company of the devas who have power over the creations of others then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this world or instead of thinking when this gift of mine is given it makes the mind serene gratification joy arise he gives a gift with the thought this is an ornament for the mind a support for the mind he gives his gift food drink clothing a vehicle a garland perfume ointment bedding shelter a lamp to a brahman or a contemplative what do you think sariputta might a person give such a gift as this yes lord having given this not seeking his own profit not with a mind attached to the reward not seeking to store up for himself nor with the thought i ll enjoy this after death nor with the thought giving is good nor with the thought this was given in the past done in the past by my father grandfather it would not be right for me to let this old family custom be discontinued nor with the thought i am well off these are not well off it would not be right for me being well off not to give a gift to those who are not well off nor with the thought just as there were the great sacrifices of the sages of the past atthaka vamaka vamadeva vessamitta yamataggi angirasa bharadvaja vasettha kassapa bhagu in the same way this will be my distribution of gifts nor with the thought when this gift of mine is given it makes the mind serene gratification joy arise but with the thought this is an ornament for the mind a support for the mind on the break up of the body after death he reappears in the company of brahma s retinue then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a non returner he does not come back to this world this sariputta is the cause this is the reason why a person gives a gift of a certain sort and it does not bear great fruit or great benefit whereas another person gives a gift of the same sort and it bears great fruit and great benefit at savatthi monks perception of forms is inconstant changeable alterable perception of sounds perception of smells perception of tastes perception of tactile sensations perception of ideas is inconstant changeable alterable one who has conviction belief that these phenomena are this way is called a faith follower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the run of the mill he is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry shades he is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry one who after pondering with a modicum of discernment has accepted that these phenomena are this way is called a dhamma follower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the run of the mill he is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry shades he is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry one who knows and sees that these phenomena are this way is called a stream enterer steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for self awakening thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living near savatthi at jetavana at the monastery of anathapindika now at that time the venerable girimananda was afflicted with a disease was suffering therefrom and was gravely ill thereupon the venerable ananda approached the buddha and having saluted him sat beside him so seated the venerable ananda said this to the blessed one bhante venerable sir the venerable girimananda is afflicted with disease is suffering therefrom and is gravely ill it were well bhante if the blessed one would visit the venerable girimananda out of compassion for him thereupon the buddha said should you ananda visit the monk girimananda and recite to him the ten contemplations then that monk girimananda having heard them will be immediately cured of his disease what are the ten contemplation of impermanence contemplation of i and what ananda is contemplation of impermanence herein ananda a monk having gone to the forest or to the foot of a tree or to an empty house lonely place contemplates thus matter visible objects is impermanent feeling or sensation is impermanent perception is impermanent formations are impermanent consciousness is impermanent thus he dwells contemplating impermanence in these five aggregates this ananda is called contemplation of impermanence ii and what ananda is contemplation of iii and what ananda is contemplation of foulness herein ananda a monk contemplates this body upward from the soles of the feet downward from the top of the hair enclosed in skin as being full of many impurities in this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs intestines intestinal tract stomach feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease saliva nasal mucous synovium oil lubricating the joints and urine thus he dwells contemplating foulness in this body this ananda is called contemplation of foulness iv what ananda is contemplation of disadvantage danger herein ananda a monk having gone to the forest or to the foot of a tree or to a lonely place contemplates thus many are the sufferings many are the disadvantages dangers of this body since diverse diseases are engendered in this body such as the following eye disease ear disease nose disease tongue disease body disease headache mumps mouth disease tooth ache cough asthma catarrh heart burn fever stomach ailment fainting dysentry swelling gripes leprosy boils scrofula consumption epilepsy ringworm itch eruption tetter pustule plethora diabetes piles cancer fistula and diseases originating from bile from phlegm from wind from conflict of the humors from changes of weather from adverse condition faulty deportment from devices practiced by others from v and what ananda is contemplation of abandonment herein ananda a monk does not tolerate a thought of sensual desire that has arisen in him dispels it makes an end of it and annihilates it he does not tolerate a thought of ill will that has arisen in him but abandons dispels it makes an end of it and annihilates it he does not tolerate a thought of cruelty that has arisen in him but abandons it dispels it makes an end of it and annihilates it he does not tolerate evil unprofitable states that arise in him from time to time but abandons them dispels them makes an end of them and annihilates them this ananda is called contemplation of abandonment vi and what ananda is contemplation of detachment herein ananda a monk having gone to the forest or to the foot of a tree or to a lonely place contemplates thus this is peaceful this is sublime namely the stilling of all conditioned things the giving up of all substratum of becoming the extinction of craving detachment nibbana this ananda is called contemplation of detachment vii and what ananda is contemplation of cessation herein ananda a monk having gone to the forest or to the foot of a tree or to a lonely place contemplates thus this is peaceful this is sublime namely the stilling of all component things the extinction of craving cessation nibbana this ananda is called contemplation of cessation viii and what ananda is contemplation of distaste for the whole world herein ananda a monk by abandoning any concern and clinging to this world by abandoning mental prejudices wrong beliefs and latent tendencies concerning this world by not grasping them but by giving them up becomes detached this ananda is called contemplation of distaste for the whole world ix and what ananda is contemplation of impermanence of all component things herein ananda a monk is wearied humiliated and disgusted with all conditioned things this ananda is called contemplation of impermanence of all component things x and what ananda is mindfulness of in breathing and out breathing herein ananda a monk having gone to the forest or to the foot of a tree or to a lonely place sits down having folded his legs crosswise keeping the body erect and his mindfulness alive mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out when he is breathing in a long breath he knows i am breathing in a long breath when he is breathing out a long breath he knows i am breathing out a long breath when he is breathing in a short breath he knows i am breathing in a short breath when he is breathing out a short breath he knows i am breathing out a short breath conscious of the entire process calming the entire process i shall breathe in thus he trains himself calming the entire process i shall breathe out thus he trains himself experiencing rapture i shall breathe in thus he trains himself experiencing rapture i shall breathe out thus he trains himself experiencing bliss i shall breathe in thus he trains himself experiencing bliss i shall breathe out thus he trains himself experiencing the mental formations feeling and perception i shall breathe in thus he trains himself experiencing

girimananda and recite to him these ten contemplations then that monk girimananda having heard them will be immediately cured of his affliction thereupon the venerable ananda having learned these ten contemplations from the blessed one visited the venerable girimananda and recited to him the ten contemplations when the venerable girimananda had heard them his affliction was immediately cured he recovered from that affliction and thus disappeared the affliction of the venerable girimananda anatta asubha thus have i heard at one time the lord was staying near savatthi in the jeta wood at anathapindika s monastery on that occasion the lord was instructing rousing inspiring and gladdening the bhikkhus with a dhamma talk connected with nibbana and those bhikkhus being receptive and attentive and concentrating the whole mind were intent on listening to dhamma then on realizing its significance the lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance there is bhikkhus that base where there is no earth no water no fire no air no base consisting of the infinity of space no base consisting of the infinity of consciousness no base consisting of nothingness no base consisting of neither perception nor non perception neither this world nor another world nor both neither sun nor moon here bhikkhus i say there is no coming no going no staying no deceasing no uprising not fixed not movable it has no support just this is the end of suffering monks suppose there was a man whose life span was years who would live to someone would say to him look here fellow they will stab you at dawn with spears at noon with spears again at evening with spears you thus stabbed day after day with spears will have a lifespan of years will live to be and at the end of years you will realize the four noble truths that you have never realized before monks a person who desired his own true benefit would do well to take up the offer why is that from an inconceivable beginning comes transmigration a beginning point is not evident for the pain of blows from spears swords axes even if this offer were to occur i tell you that the realization of the four noble truths would not be accompanied by pain distress instead i tell you the realization of the four noble truths would be accompanied by pleasure happiness which four the noble truth of stress the noble truth of the origination of stress the noble truth of the cessation of stress and the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress therefore your duty is the contemplation this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress once monks in this same so kali the slave got up after daybreak then lady vedehika said to her hey kali yes madam why did you get up after daybreak no reason madam no reason you wicked slave and yet you get up after daybreak angered displeased she scowled then the thought occurred to kali the slave anger so kali the slave got up later in the day then lady vedehika said to her hey kali yes madam why did you get up later in the day no reason madam no reason you wicked slave and yet you get up later in the day angered displeased she grumbled then the thought occurred to kali the slave anger so kali the slave got up even later in the day then lady vedehika said to her hey kali yes madam why did you get up even later in the day no reason madam no reason you wicked slave and yet you get up even later in the day angered displeased she grabbed hold of a rolling pin and gave her a whack over the head cutting it open then kali the slave with blood streaming from her cut open head went and denounced her mistress to the neighbors see ladies the gentle one s handiwork see the even tempered one s handiwork see the calm one s handiwork how could she angered displeased with her only slave for getting up after daybreak grab hold of a rolling pin and give her a whack over the head cutting it open after that this evil report about lady vedehika circulated lady vedehika is vicious lady vedehika is foul tempered lady vedehika is violent monks there are these no lord why is that because this great earth is deep enormous it can t easily be made to be without earth the man would reap only a share of weariness disappointment in the same way monks there are these five aspects of speech by which others may address you timely or untimely true or false affectionate or harsh beneficial or unbeneficial with a mind of good will or with inner hate others may address you in a timely way or an untimely way they may address you with what is true or what is false they may address you in an affectionate way or a harsh way they may address you in a beneficial way or an unbeneficial way they may address you with a mind of good will or with inner hate in any event you should train yourselves our minds will be unaffected and we will say no evil words we will remain sympathetic to that person s welfare with a mind of good will and with no inner hate we will keep pervading him with an awareness imbued with good will and beginning with him we will keep pervading the all encompassing world with an awareness imbued with good will equal to the great earth abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will that s how you should train yourselves no lord why is that because space is formless featureless it s not easy to draw pictures there and to make them appear the man would reap only a share of weariness

this thought occurred to me what being present does decay and death come to be what conditions decay and death then monks as i considered this thoroughly arising arising at this thought monks there arose in me concerning things unheard of before vision then monks the thought occurred to me by the absence of what does decay and death not come to be then monks as i considered this thoroughly the insight and comprehension dawned on me in the absence of birth decay and death does not come to be from the ceasing of birth comes the ceasing of decay and death becoming grasping craving feeling contact the six sense bases name form consciousness the formations by the ceasing of ignorance comes the ceasing of the formations so comes about the cessation of this entire mass of suffering cessation cessation at this thought monks there arose in me concerning things unheard of before vision knowledge understanding light last night monks a certain devata in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of jeta s grove came to me and on arrival bowed down to me and stood to one side as she was standing there she said to me these seven qualities lord lead to a monk s non decline which seven respect for the teacher respect for the dhamma respect for the sangha respect for training respect for concentration compliance that is what that devata said having said it she bowed down to me circled me three times and then disappeared right there respecting the teacher respecting the dhamma and with fierce respect for the sangha respecting concentration ardent and with fierce respect for training having admirable friends compliant deferential respectful incapable of decline one is right in the presence of unbinding i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in the lord the monks replied the blessed one said this this is the direct path for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow lamentation for the disappearance of pain distress for the attainment of the right method for the realization of unbinding in other words the four frames of reference which four there is the case where a monk remains focused on the body

rewards for one who practices walking meditation which five he can endure traveling by foot he can endure exertion he becomes free from disease whatever he has eaten drunk chewed savored becomes well digested the concentration he wins while doing walking meditation lasts for a long time these are the five rewards for one who practices walking meditation monks there are these there is the case where an individual keeps pervading the first direction again there is the case where an individual keeps pervading the first direction as well as the second direction the third the fourth with an awareness imbued with compassion thus he keeps pervading above below all around everywhere in every respect the all encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with compassion abundant expansive

expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will he savors that longs for that finds satisfaction through that staying there fixed on that dwelling there often not falling away from that then when he dies he reappears in conjunction with the vehapphala these are four types of individuals to be found existing in the world setting at savatthi then in the morning the bhikkhuni sisupacala dressed she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day s abiding then mara the evil one approached the bhikkhuni sisupacala and said to her whose creed do you approve of bhikkhuni i don t approve of anyone s creed friend then mara the evil one realizing the bhikkhuni sisupacala knows me sad and disappointed disappeared right there mara sisupacala i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near now on that occasion the wanderers of other persuasions had come together in a gathering and were sitting discussing many kinds of bestial topics no venerable sirs the blessed one does not criticize all asceticism nor does he categorically denounce or disparage all ascetics who live the rough life the blessed one criticizes what should be criticized and praises what should be praised criticizing what should be criticized praising what should be praised the blessed one is one who speaks making distinctions not one who speaks categorically on this matter when this was said one of the wanderers said to vajjiya mahita the householder now wait a minute householder this contemplative gotama whom you praise is a nihilist one who doesn t declare anything i tell you venerable sirs that the blessed one righteously declares that this is skillful he declares that this is unskillful declaring that this is skillful and this is unskillful he is one who has declared a teaching he is not a nihilist one who doesn t declare anything when this was said the wanderers fell silent abashed sitting with their shoulders drooping their heads down brooding at a loss for words vajjiya mahita the householder perceiving that the wanderers were silent abashed at a loss for words got up went to the blessed one on arrival having bowed down to the blessed one he sat to one side as he was sitting there he told the blessed one the entirety of his conversation with the wanderers the blessed one said well done householder well done that is how you should periodically righteously refute those foolish men i don t say that all asceticism is to be pursued nor do i say that all asceticism is not to be pursued i don t say that all observances should be observed nor do i day that all observances should not be observed i don t say that all exertions are to be pursued nor do i say that all exertions are not to be pursued i don t say that all forfeiture should be forfeited nor do i say that all forfeiture should not be forfeited i don t say that all release is to be used for release nor do i say that all release is not to be used for release if when an asceticism is pursued unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities wane then i tell you that that sort of asceticism is not to be pursued but if when an asceticism is pursued unskillful qualities wane and skillful qualities grow then i tell you that that sort of asceticism is to be pursued if when an observance is observed unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities wane then i tell you that that sort of observance is not to be observed but if when an observance is observed unskillful qualities wane and skillful qualities grow then i tell you that that sort of observance is to be observed if when an exertion is pursued a forfeiture is forfeited if when a release is used for release unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities wane then i tell you that that sort of release is not to be used for release but if when a release is used for release unskillful qualities wane and skillful qualities grow then i tell you that that sort of release is to be used for release when vajjiya mahita the householder had been instructed urged roused encouraged by the blessed one with a talk on dhamma he got up from his seat and having bowed down to the blessed one left keeping the blessed one on his right side not long afterward the blessed one addressed the monks monks even a monk who has long penetrated the dhamma in this doctrine discipline would do well periodically righteously to refute the wanderers of other persuasions in just the way vajjiya mahita the householder has done i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near yes brahman so it is the sons of good families who have gone forth from the home life into homelessness out of conviction in me i am their leader i am their helper i am their inspirer they take me as their example but master gotama it s not easy to endure isolated forest or wilderness dwellings it s not easy to maintain seclusion not easy to enjoy being alone the forests as it were plunder the mind of a monk who has not attained concentration yes brahman so it is it s not easy to endure isolated forest or wilderness dwellings it s not easy to maintain seclusion not easy to enjoy being alone the forests as it were plunder the mind of a monk who has not attained concentration before my awakening when i was still an unawakened bodhisatta the thought occurred to me as well it s not easy to endure isolated forest or wilderness dwellings it s not easy to maintain seclusion not easy to enjoy being alone the forests as it were plunder the mind of a monk who has not attained concentration the thought occurred to me when brahmans or contemplatives who are unpurified in their bodily activities resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings it s the fault of their unpurified bodily activities that they give rise to unskillful fear terror but it s not the case that i am unpurified in my bodily activities when i resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings i am purified in my bodily activities i am one of those noble ones who are purified in their bodily activities when they resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings seeing in myself this purity of bodily activities i felt even more undaunted about staying in the wilderness the thought occurred to me when brahmans or contemplatives who are unpurified in their verbal activities unpurified in their mental activities unpurified in their livelihood resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings it s the fault of their unpurified livelihood that they give rise to unskillful fear terror but it s not the case that i am unpurified in my livelihood when i resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings i am purified in my livelihood i am one of those noble ones who are purified in their livelihood when they resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings seeing in myself this purity of livelihood i felt even more undaunted about staying in the wilderness the thought occurred to me when brahmans or contemplatives who are covetous fiercely passionate for sensual pleasures i am not covetous when brahmans or contemplatives who have minds of ill will with destructive attitudes i have a mind of good will when brahmans or contemplatives who are overcome by sloth drowsiness i am devoid of sloth drowsiness when brahmans or contemplatives who are restless with an unstill mind i have a still mind when brahmans or contemplatives who are uncertain doubting i have gone beyond uncertainty when brahmans or contemplatives who are given to praising themselves disparaging others i do not praise myself or disparage others when brahmans or contemplatives who tend toward panic dread i have gone beyond horripilation when brahmans or contemplatives who are desirous of gains offerings fame i have few wants when brahmans or contemplatives who are lazy lacking in persistence my persistence is aroused when brahmans or contemplatives who are muddled in their mindfulness unalert i have mindfulness established when brahmans or contemplatives who are unconcentrated with straying minds i am consummate in concentration the thought occurred to me when brahmans or contemplatives who are drooling idiots resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings it s the fault of their drooling idiocy that they give rise to unskillful fear terror but it s not the case that i am a drooling idiot when i resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings i am consummate in discernment i am one of those noble ones who are consummate in discernment when they resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings seeing in myself this consummate discernment i felt even more undaunted about staying in the wilderness what if i in whatever state i m in when fear terror come to me were to subdue that fear terror in that very state so when fear terror came to me while i was walking back forth i would not stand or sit or lie down i would keep walking back forth until i had subdued that fear terror when fear terror came to me while i was standing i would not walk or sit or lie down i would keep standing until i had subdued that fear terror when fear terror came to me while i was sitting i would not lie down or stand up or walk i would keep sitting until i had subdued that fear terror when fear terror came to me while i was lying down i would not sit up or stand or walk i would keep lying down until i had subdued that fear terror there are some brahmans contemplatives brahman who have the perception of day when it is night and of night when it is day this i tell you is their being in a dwelling of delusion as for me i have the perception of day when it is day and of night when it is night if anyone when speaking rightly were to say a being not subject to delusion has appeared in the world for the benefit happiness of many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit happiness of human divine beings he would rightly be speaking of me unflagging persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established my body was calm unaroused my mind concentrated single quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities i entered remained in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations i entered remained in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance with the fading of rapture i remained in equanimity mindful alert and physically sensitive of pleasure i entered remained in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress i entered remained in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain when the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady attained to imperturbability i directed it to the this was the first knowledge i attained in the first watch of the night ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose as happens in one who is heedful ardent resolute when the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady attained to imperturbability i directed it to the this was the second knowledge i attained in the second watch of the night ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose as happens in one who is heedful ardent resolute when the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady attained to imperturbability i directed it to the this was the third knowledge i attained in the third watch of the night ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose as happens in one who is heedful ardent resolute now brahman if the thought should occur to you perhaps gotama the contemplative is even today not free of passion not free of aversion not free of delusion which is why he resorts to isolated forest wilderness dwellings it should not be seen in that way it s through seeing two compelling reasons that i resort to isolated forest wilderness dwellings seeing a pleasant abiding for myself in the present and feeling sympathy for future generations how truly future generations have been shown sympathy by master gotama in the manner of one who is worthy rightly self awakened in every case where a in every case where a family can hold onto its great wealth for long it is for one or another of these four reasons which four they look for things that are lost they repair things that have gotten old they are moderate in consuming food and drink they place a virtuous principled woman or man in the position of authority in every case where a family can hold onto its great wealth for long it is for one or another of these four reasons who in the world is a man constrained by conscience who awakens to censure like a fine stallion to the whip those restrained by conscience are rare those who go through life always mindful having reached the end of suffering stress they go through what is uneven evenly go through what is out of tune in tune on one occasion householder the ven ananda is staying near vesali at veluvagamaka then dasama the householder from atthakanagara on completing his business at pataliputta went to ven ananda at veluvagamaka near vesali on arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to ven ananda venerable sir is there a single quality declared by the blessed one the one who knows the one who sees worthy rightly self awakened where the unreleased mind of a monk who dwells there heedful ardent resolute becomes released or his unended fermentations go to their total ending or he attains the unexcelled security from the yoke that he had not attained before yes householder there is and what is that one quality venerable sir there is the case householder where a monk withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation he reflects on this and discerns this first jhana is fabricated intended now whatever is fabricated intended is inconstant subject to cessation staying right there he reaches the ending of the mental fermentations or if not then through this very dhamma passion this dhamma delight and from the total wasting away of the first five fetters this householder is a single quality declared by the blessed one the one who knows the one who sees worthy rightly self awakened where the unreleased mind of a monk who dwells there heedful ardent resolute becomes released or his unended fermentations go to their total ending or he attains the unexcelled security from the yoke that he had not attained before this too householder is a single quality declared by the blessed one the one who knows the one who sees worthy rightly self awakened where the unreleased mind of a monk who dwells there heedful ardent resolute becomes released or his unended fermentations go to their total ending or he attains the unexcelled security from the yoke that he had not attained before this too householder is a single quality declared by the blessed one the one who knows the one who sees worthy rightly self awakened where the unreleased mind of a monk who dwells there heedful ardent resolute becomes released or his unended fermentations go to their total ending or he attains the unexcelled security from the yoke that he had not attained before when this was said dasama the householder from atthakanagara said to ven ananda venerable ananda so dasama the householder from atthakanagara having assembled the community of monks from vesali and pataliputta with his own hands served satisfied them with refined staple non staple foods he presented a pair of cloths to each monk and a triple robe to ven ananda and for ven ananda he had a dwelling built worth five hundred kahapanas thus it has been heard by me on one occasion the blessed one was dwelling at s vatthi in the jeta forest in the private park owned by an thapi ika there the blessed one addressed the monks thus monks those monks responded thus blessed one the blessed one said this monks the ordinary person but indeed that which monks is called mind or thought or consciousness better monks to let the ordinary person in all ways unlearned in spiritual knowledge proceed from the assumption that the self is this physical body made up of the four great elements rather than mind but indeed that which monks is called mind or thought or consciousness that by night and by day as other indeed arises as other ceases therein monks the noble disciple learned in spiritual knowledge properly and legitimately cognizes which is this from ignorance as condition the formative mental functions but from the fading away and cessation without any trace remaining of ignorance there is the cessation of the formative mental functions from the cessation of the formative mental functions the cessation of sensory consciousness from the cessation of sensory consciousness the cessation of name and form from the cessation of name and form the cessation of the six sense bases from the cessation of the six sense bases the cessation of contact from the cessation of contact the cessation of sensation from the cessation of sensation the cessation of craving from the cessation of craving the cessation of clinging from the cessation of clinging the cessation of being from the cessation of being the cessation of birth from the cessation of birth old age and death grief lamentation suffering distress and tribulation cease thus there is the cessation of this whole complex of suffering seeing thus monks a noble disciple learned in spiritual knowledge grows weary and turns away at migajala there are forms cognizable via the eye agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing and a monk relishes them welcomes them

aversion delusion fear transgress the dhamma your honor wanes as in the dark fortnight the moon there are these four ways of not going off course which four one does not go off course through desire one does not go off course through aversion one does not go off course through delusion one does not go off course through fear these are the four ways of not going off course if you don t through desire aversion delusion fear transgress the dhamma your honor waxes as in the bright fortnight the moon i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near yes lord the monks replied the blessed one said monks i will teach you a statement its analysis listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said this a monk should investigate in such a way that his consciousness neither externally scattered diffused nor internally positioned he would from lack of clinging sustenance be unagitated when his consciousness neither externally scattered diffused nor internally positioned from lack of clinging sustenance he would be unagitated there is no seed for the conditions of future birth aging death or stress that is what the blessed one said having said it the one well gone got up from his seat and went into his dwelling then not long after the blessed one had left this thought occurred to the monks this brief statement the blessed one has made after which he went into his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning i e a monk should investigate in such a way that his consciousness neither externally scattered diffused nor internally positioned he would from lack of clinging sustenance be unagitated when his consciousness neither externally scattered diffused nor internally positioned from lack of clinging sustenance he would be unagitated there is no seed for the conditions of future birth aging death or stress now who might analyze the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement then the thought occurred to them ven maha kaccana is praised by the teacher and esteemed by his knowledgeable companions in the holy life he is capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement suppose we were to go to him and on arrival question him about this matter so the monks went to he replied friends it s yes friend kaccana knowing the blessed one knows seeing he sees he is the eye he is knowledge he is dhamma he is brahma he is the speaker the proclaimer the elucidator of meaning the giver of the deathless the lord of the dhamma the tathagata that was the time when we should have questioned him about this matter however he answered that was how we should have remembered it but you are praised by the teacher and esteemed by your knowledgeable companions in the holy life you are capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement analyze the meaning ven maha kaccana without making it difficult in that case my friends listen pay close attention i will speak as you say friend the monks responded ven maha kaccana said this friends concerning the brief statement the blessed one made after which he entered his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning i e a monk should investigate in such a way that his consciousness neither externally scattered diffused nor internally positioned he would from lack of clinging sustenance be unagitated when his consciousness neither externally scattered diffused nor internally positioned from lack of clinging sustenance he would be unagitated there is no seed for the conditions of future birth aging death or stress i understand the detailed meaning to be this how is consciousness said to be scattered diffused there is the case where a form is seen with the eye and consciousness follows the drift of lit flows after the theme of the form is tied to the attraction of the theme of the form is chained to the attraction of the theme of the form is fettered joined to the attraction of the theme of the form consciousness is said to be externally scattered diffused there is the case where a sound is heard with the ear an aroma is smelled with the nose a flavor is tasted with the tongue a tactile sensation is felt with the body an idea is cognized with the intellect and consciousness follows the drift of the theme of the idea is tied to the attraction of the theme of the idea is chained to the attraction of the theme of the idea is fettered joined to the attraction of the theme of the idea consciousness is said to be externally scattered diffused and how is consciousness said not to be externally scattered diffused there is the case where a form is seen with the eye and consciousness does not follow the drift of the theme of the form is not tied to chained to fettered or joined to the attraction of the theme of the form consciousness is said not to be externally scattered diffused there is the case where a sound is heard with the ear an aroma is smelled with the nose a flavor is tasted with the tongue a tactile sensation is felt with the body an idea is cognized with the intellect and consciousness does not follow the drift of the theme of the idea is not tied to chained to fettered or joined to the attraction of the theme of the idea consciousness is said not to be externally scattered diffused and how is the mind said to be internally positioned there is the case where a monk quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation his consciousness follows the drift of the rapture pleasure born of withdrawal is tied to chained fettered joined to the attraction of the rapture pleasure born of withdrawal or further with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance his consciousness follows the drift of the rapture pleasure born of composure is tied to chained fettered joined to the attraction of the rapture pleasure born of composure or further with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding his consciousness follows the drift of the equanimity pleasure is tied to chained fettered joined to the attraction of the equanimity pleasure or further with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress he enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain his consciousness follows the drift of the neither pleasure nor pain is tied to chained to fettered joined to the attraction of the neither pleasure nor pain the mind is said to be internally positioned and how is the mind said not to be internally positioned there is the case where a monk quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation his consciousness does not follow the drift of the rapture pleasure born of withdrawal is not tied to chained to fettered or joined to the attraction of the rapture pleasure born of withdrawal or further with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance his consciousness does not follow the drift of the rapture pleasure born of composure is not tied to chained fettered or joined to the attraction of the rapture pleasure born of composure or further with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in

joined to the attraction of the equanimity pleasure or further with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress he enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain his consciousness does not follow the drift of the neither pleasure nor pain is not tied to chained to fettered or joined to the attraction of the neither pleasure nor pain the mind is said to be not internally positioned and how is agitation caused by clinging sustenance there is the case where an uninstructed run of the mill person who has no regard for noble ones is not well versed or disciplined in their dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not well versed or disciplined in their dhamma assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form his form changes is unstable because of the change instability of form his consciousness alters in accordance with the change in form with the agitations born from the alteration in accordance with the change in form and coming from the co arising of unskillful mental qualities his mind stays consumed and because of the consumption of awareness he feels fearful threatened solicitous he assumes feeling to be the self he assumes perception to be the self he assumes mental fabrications to be the self he assumes consciousness to be the self of the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness his consciousness changes is unstable because of the change instability of consciousness his consciousness alters in accordance with the change in consciousness with the agitations born from the alteration in accordance with the change in consciousness and coming from the co arising of unskillful mental qualities his mind stays consumed and because of the consumption of awareness he feels fearful threatened solicitous this friends is how agitation is caused by clinging sustenance and how is non agitation caused by lack of clinging sustenance there is the case where an instructed disciple of the noble ones who has regard for noble ones is well versed disciplined in their dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is well versed disciplined in their dhamma doesn t assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form his form changes is unstable but his consciousness doesn t because of the change instability of form alter in accordance with the change in form his mind is not consumed with any agitations born from an alteration in accordance with the change in form or coming from the co arising of unskillful mental qualities and because his awareness is not consumed he feels neither fearful threatened nor solicitous he doesn t assume feeling to be the self he doesn t assume perception to be the self he doesn t assume fabrications to be the self he doesn t assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness his consciousness changes is unstable but his consciousness doesn t because of the change instability of consciousness alter in accordance with the change in consciousness his mind is not consumed with any agitations born from an alteration in accordance with the change in consciousness or coming from the co arising of unskillful mental qualities and because his awareness is not consumed he feels neither fearful threatened nor solicitous this friends is how non agitation is caused by lack of clinging sustenance so concerning the brief statement the blessed one made after which he entered his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning i e a monk should investigate in such a way that his consciousness neither externally scattered diffused nor internally positioned he would from lack of clinging sustenance be unagitated when his consciousness neither externally scattered diffused nor internally positioned from lack of clinging sustenance he would be unagitated there is no seed for the conditions of future birth aging death or stress this is how i understand the detailed meaning now friends if you wish having gone to the blessed one question him about this matter however he answers is how you should remember it then the monks delighting in approving of ven maha kaccayana s words got up from their seats and went to the blessed one on arrival having bowed down to him they sat to one side as they were sitting there they told him what had happened after he had gone into his dwelling and ended by saying then ven maha kaccayana analyzed the meaning using these words these statements these phrases maha kaccayana is wise monks he is a person of great discernment if you had asked me about this matter i too would have answered in the same way he did that is its meaning and that is how you should remember it that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words these are the five factors for exertion which five there is the case where a monk has conviction is convinced of the tathagata s awakening indeed the blessed one is pure rightly self awakened consummate in knowledge conduct well gone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the teacher of divine human beings awakened blessed he is free from illness discomfort endowed with good digestion not too cold not too hot of moderate strength fit for exertion he is neither fraudulent nor deceitful he declares himself to the teacher or to his wise friends in the holy life in line with what he actually is he keeps his energy aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities he is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities he is discerning endowed with discernment leading to the arising of the goal noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress these are the five factors for exertion on one occasion the blessed one was staying near i tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappear it is amazing lord and awesome how well that has been said by the blessed one i tell you friend that it is not possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one does not take birth age die pass away or reappear once i was a seer named rohitassa a student of when this was said the blessed one responded it s not to be reached by traveling the end of the cosmos regardless and it s not without reaching the end of the cosmos that there is release from suffering stress so truly the wise one an expert with regard to the cosmos a knower of the end of the cosmos having fulfilled the holy life calmed knowing the cosmos end doesn t long for this cosmos or for any other monks if you are asked by wanderers of other sects friends there are these three qualities which three passion aversion delusion these are the three qualities now what is the difference what the distinction what the distinguishing factor among these three qualities when thus asked how would you answer those wanderers of other sects for us lord the teachings have the blessed one as their root their guide their arbitrator it would be good if the blessed one himself would explicate the meaning of this statement having heard it from the blessed one the monks will remember it in that case monks listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said monks if you are asked by wanderers of other sects friends there are these three qualities which three passion aversion delusion these are the three qualities now what is the difference what the distinction what the distinguishing factor among these three qualities when thus asked you should answer those wanderers of other sects in this way friends passion carries little blame and is slow to fade aversion carries great blame and is quick to fade delusion carries great blame and is slow to fade then if they ask but what friends is the reason what the cause why unarisen passion arises or arisen passion tends to growth abundance the theme of the attractive it should be said for one who attends inappropriately to the theme of the attractive unarisen passion arises and arisen passion tends to growth abundance then if they ask but what friends is the reason what the cause why unarisen aversion arises or arisen aversion tends to growth abundance the theme of irritation it should be said for one who attends inappropriately to the theme of irritation unarisen aversion arises and arisen aversion tends to growth abundance then if they ask but what friends is the reason what the cause why unarisen delusion arises or arisen delusion tends to growth abundance inappropriate attention it should be said for one who attends inappropriately unarisen delusion arises and arisen delusion tends to growth abundance then if they ask but what friends is the reason what the cause why unarisen passion does not arise or arisen passion is abandoned the theme of the unattractive it should be said for one who attends appropriately to the theme of the unattractive unarisen passion does not arise and arisen passion is abandoned then if they ask but what friends is the reason what the cause why unarisen aversion does not arise or arisen aversion is abandoned good will as an awareness release it should be said for one who attends appropriately to good will as an awareness release unarisen aversion does not arise and arisen aversion is abandoned then if they ask but what friends is the reason what the cause why unarisen delusion does not arise or arisen delusion is abandoned appropriate attention it should be said for one who attends appropriately unarisen delusion does not arise and arisen delusion is abandoned this is the reason this the cause why unarisen delusion does not arise and arisen delusion is abandoned monks there are these four bonanzas of merit bonanzas of skillfulness nourishments of bliss which four there is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the awakened one indeed the blessed one is worthy and rightly self awakened consummate in knowledge conduct well gone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the teacher of divine human beings awakened blessed this is the first bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss furthermore the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the dhamma the dhamma is well expounded by the blessed one to be seen here now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselves this is the second bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss furthermore the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the sangha the sangha of the blessed one s disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straight forwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully in other words the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types they are the sangha of the blessed one s disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the incomparable field of merit for the world this is the third bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss furthermore the disciple of the noble ones is discerning endowed with discernment of arising passing away noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress this is the fourth bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss these are four bonanzas of merit bonanzas of skillfulness nourishments of bliss endowed with these six qualities a person is incapable of alighting on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities even when listening to the true dhamma which six when the doctrine discipline declared by the tathagata is being taught he does not listen well does not give ear does not apply his mind to gnosis grabs hold of what is worthless rejects what is worthwhile and is not endowed with the patience to conform with the teaching endowed with these six qualities a person is incapable of alighting on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities even when listening to the true dhamma endowed with these six qualities a person is capable of alighting on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities even while listening to the true dhamma which six when the doctrine discipline declared by the tathagata is being taught he listens well gives ear applies his mind to gnosis rejects what is worthless grabs hold of what is worthwhile and is endowed with the patience to conform with the teaching endowed with these six qualities a person is capable of alighting on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities even while listening to the true dhamma i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near rajagaha on vulture s peak mountain then early in the morning ven sariputta put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe was coming down from vulture s peak mountain with a large group of monks when he saw a large wood pile off to one side seeing it he said to the monks friends do you see that large wood pile over there yes friend the monks replied friends if he wanted to a monk with psychic power having attained mastery of his mind could will that wood pile to be nothing but earth why is that there is earth property if he wanted to a monk with psychic power having attained mastery of his mind could will that wood pile to be nothing but water fire wind beautiful unattractive why is that there is the property of the unattractive in that wood pile in dependence on which he could will that wood pile to be nothing but unattractive when near the river you are emaciated and ill looking you are near to death a thousand parts of you belong to death and only a fraction of you is alive live good sir it is better to live living you may perform meritorious deeds from practicing celibacy and tending the sacrificial fire much merit is made but what is obtained from striving it is difficult to enter the path of exertion it is difficult to do difficult to maintain you who are the friend of the negligent o evil one for what reason have you come here those who still have use for merit mara may consider worthwhile addressing i have faith and energy and wisdom being thus bent on striving why do you ask me to live this wind will wither the currents of the rivers why should not my exertion dry up even the blood when the blood dries up the bile and phlegm wither on the wasting away of the flesh the mind becomes more and more serene and my mindfulness wisdom and concentration are established more firmly in me who abides enduring such an extreme experience the mind does not long for sensual pleasures see the purity of a being sensual desire is your first army the second is called discontent the third is hunger and thirst the fourth craving the fifth sluggishness and laziness the sixth fear the seventh indecision and the eighth disparagement of others and stubbornness gain fame honor prestige wrongly acquired and whoever praises himself and despises others these namuci are your armies the dark one s i wear mu ja grass seeing the surrounding army ready and mara mounted on his elephant i am going out to fight so that he may not shift me from my position this army of yours which the world together with the devas is unable to subdue that i will destroy with wisdom like an unbaked clay bowl with a stone having mastered the mind and firmly established mindfulness i shall wander from country to country guiding many disciples and they will be diligent and energetic in practicing my teaching the teaching of one without sensual desire and they will go where having gone one does not grieve mara for seven years i followed the lord step by step but did not find an opportunity to defeat that mindful awakened one a crow flew around a stone having the color of fat can we find even here something tender may it be something to eat not finding anything edible the crow left that place as with the crow and the stone we leave gotama having approached and become disheartened overcome by sorrow his lute fell from his arm and thereupon the unhappy spirit disappeared from that place i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near yes friend the monks responded ven sariputta said friends just as the footprints of all legged animals are encompassed by the footprint of the elephant and the elephant s footprint is reckoned the foremost among them in terms of size in the same way all skillful qualities are gathered under the four noble truths under which four under the noble truth of stress under the noble truth of the origination of stress under the noble truth of the cessation of stress and under the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress and what is the noble truth of stress birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress despair are stressful not getting what is wanted is stressful the earth property and what is the earth property the earth property can be either internal or external which is the internal earth property whatever internal within oneself is hard solid sustained by craving head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small intestines contents of the stomach feces or whatever else internal within oneself is hard solid sustained this is called the internal earth property now both the internal earth property and the external earth property are simply earth property and that should be seen as it actually is with right discernment this is not mine this is not me this is not my self when one sees it thus as it actually is with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the earth property and makes the mind dispassionate toward the earth property now there comes a time friends when the external liquid property is provoked now if other people insult malign exasperate harass a monk who has discerned this he discerns that a painful feeling born of ear contact has arisen within me and that is dependent not independent dependent on what dependent on contact and he sees that contact is inconstant feeling is inconstant perception is inconstant consciousness is inconstant his mind with the earth property as its object support leaps up grows confident steadfast released and if other people attack the monk in ways that are undesirable displeasing disagreeable through contact with fists contact with stones contact with sticks or contact with knives the monk discerns that this body is of such a nature that contacts with fists come contacts with stones come contacts with sticks come contacts with knives come now the blessed one has said in his exhortation of the and if in the monk recollecting the buddha dhamma sangha in this way equanimity based on what is skillful is not established he feels apprehensive at that and gives rise to a sense of urgency it is a loss for me not a gain ill gotten for me not well gotten that when i recollect the buddha dhamma sangha in this way equanimity based on what is skillful is not established within me but if in the monk recollecting the buddha dhamma sangha in this way equanimity based on what is skillful is established then he is gratified at that and even to this extent friends the monk has accomplished a great deal the liquid property and what is the liquid property the liquid property may be either internal or external what is the internal liquid property whatever internal belonging to oneself is liquid watery sustained bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears skin oil saliva mucus fluid in the joints urine or whatever else internal within oneself is liquid watery sustained this is called the internal liquid property now both the internal liquid property and the external liquid property are simply liquid property and that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment this is not mine this is not me this is not my self when one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the liquid property and makes the mind dispassionate toward the liquid property now there comes a time friends when the external liquid property is provoked and washes away village town city district country there comes a time when the water in the great ocean drops down one hundred leagues two hundred three hundred four hundred five hundred six hundred seven hundred leagues there comes a time when the water in the great ocean stands seven palm trees deep six five four three two palm trees deep one palm tree deep there comes a time when the water in the great ocean stands seven fathoms deep six five four three two fathoms deep one fathom deep there comes a time when the water in the great ocean stands half a fathom deep hip deep knee deep ankle deep there comes a time when the water in the great ocean is not even the depth of the first joint of a finger so when even in the external liquid property so vast inconstancy will be discerned destructibility will be discerned a tendency to decay will be discerned changeability will be discerned then what in this short lasting body sustained by clinging is i or mine or what i am it has here only a no now if other people insult malign exasperate harass a monk who has discerned this he discerns that a painful feeling born of ear contact has arisen within me and that is dependent not independent dependent on what dependent on contact and he sees that contact is inconstant feeling is inconstant perception is inconstant consciousness is inconstant his mind with the liquid property as its object support leaps up grows confident steadfast released and if other people attack the monk in ways that are undesirable displeasing disagreeable through contact with fists contact with stones contact with sticks or contact with knives the monk discerns that this body is of such a nature that contacts with fists come contacts with stones come contacts with sticks come contacts with knives come now the blessed one has said in his exhortation of the simile of the saw monks even if bandits were to carve you up savagely limb by limb with a two handled saw he among you who let his heart get angered even at that would not be doing my bidding so my persistence will be aroused untiring my mindfulness established unconfused my body calm unaroused my mind centered unified and now let contact with fists come to this body let contact with stones with sticks with knives come to this body for this is how the buddha s bidding is done and if in the monk recollecting the buddha dhamma sangha in this way equanimity based on what is skillful is not established he feels apprehensive at that and gives rise to a sense of urgency it is a loss for me not a gain ill gotten for me not well gotten that when i recollect the buddha dhamma sangha in this way equanimity based on what is skillful is not established within me just as when a daughter in law on seeing her father in law feels apprehensive and gives rise to a sense of urgency to please him in the same way if in the monk recollecting the buddha dhamma sangha in this way equanimity based on what is skillful is not established he feels apprehensive at that and gives rise to a sense of urgency it is a loss for me not a gain ill gotten for me not well gotten that when i recollect the buddha dhamma sangha in this way equanimity based on what is skillful is not established within me but if in the monk recollecting the buddha dhamma sangha in this way equanimity based on what is skillful is established then he is gratified at that and even to this extent friends the monk has accomplished a great deal the fire property and what is the fire property the fire property may be either internal or external what is the internal fire property whatever internal belonging to oneself is fire fiery sustained that by which the body is warmed aged consumed with fever and that by which what is eaten drunk chewed savored gets properly digested or whatever else internal within oneself is fire fiery sustained this is called the internal fire property now both the internal fire property and the external fire property are simply fire property and that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment this is not mine this is not me this is not my self when one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the fire property and makes the mind dispassionate toward the fire property now there comes a time friends when the external fire property is provoked and consumes village town city district country and then coming to the edge of a green district the edge of a road the edge of a rocky district to the water s edge or to a lush well watered area goes out from lack of sustenance there comes a time when people try to make fire using a wing bone tendon parings so when even in the external fire property so vast inconstancy will be discerned destructibility will be discerned a tendency to decay will be discerned changeability will be discerned then what in

gotten for me not well gotten that when i recollect the buddha dhamma sangha in this way equanimity based on what is skillful is not established within me just as when a daughter in law on seeing her father in law feels apprehensive and gives rise to a sense of urgency to please him in the same way if in the monk recollecting the buddha dhamma sangha in this way equanimity based on what is skillful is not established he feels apprehensive at that and gives rise to a sense of urgency it is a loss for me not a gain ill gotten for me not well gotten that when i recollect the buddha dhamma sangha in this way equanimity based on what is skillful is not established within me but if in the monk recollecting the buddha dhamma sangha in this way equanimity based on what is skillful is established then he is gratified at that and even to this extent friends the monk has accomplished a great deal the space property friends dependent co arising now if internally the eye is intact but externally forms do not come into range nor is there a corresponding engagement then there is no appearing of the corresponding type of consciousness if internally the eye is intact and externally forms come into range but there is no corresponding engagement then there is no appearing of the corresponding type of consciousness but when internally the eye is intact and externally forms come into range and there is a corresponding engagement then there is the appearing of the corresponding type of consciousness the form of what has thus come into being is gathered under the form clinging aggregate the feeling of what has thus come into being is gathered under the feeling clinging aggregate the perception of what has thus come into being is gathered under the perception clinging aggregate the fabrications of what has thus come into being are gathered under the fabrication clinging aggregate the consciousness of what has thus come into being is gathered under the consciousness clinging aggregate one discerns this it seems is how there is the gathering meeting convergence of these five clinging aggregates now the blessed one has said whoever sees dependent co arising sees the dhamma whoever sees the dhamma sees dependent co arising now if internally the ear is intact now if internally the nose is intact now if internally the tongue is intact now if internally the body is intact now if internally the intellect is intact but externally ideas do not come into range nor is there a corresponding engagement then there is no appearing of the corresponding type of consciousness if internally the intellect is intact and externally ideas come into range but there is no corresponding engagement then there is no appearing of the corresponding type of consciousness but when internally the intellect is intact and externally ideas come into range and there is a corresponding engagement then there is the appearing of the corresponding type of consciousness the form

what has thus come into being is gathered under the consciousness clinging aggregate one discerns this it seems is how there is the gathering meeting convergence of these five clinging aggregates now the blessed one has said whoever sees dependent co arising sees the dhamma whoever sees the dhamma sees dependent co arising and these things the five clinging aggregates are dependently co arisen any desire embracing grasping holding on to these five clinging aggregates is the origination of stress any subduing of desire passion any abandoning of desire passion for these five clinging aggregates is the cessation of stress and even to this extent friends the monk has accomplished a great deal that is what ven sariputta said gratified the monks delighted in ven sariputta s words at then mara the evil one wanting to arouse fear horripilation terror in her wanting to make her fall away from seclusion there s no escape in the world so what are you trying to do with solitude enjoy sensual delights don t be someone who later regrets then the thought occurred to alavika the nun now who has recited this verse a human being or a non human one then it occurred to her this is mara the evil one who has recited this verse wanting to arouse fear horripilation terror in me wanting to make me fall away from seclusion then having understood that this is mara the evil one she replied to him in verses there then mara the evil one sad dejected at realizing alavika the nun knows me vanished right there on one occasion the blessed one was staying near yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said monks dwell consummate in virtue consummate in terms of the patimokkha dwell restrained in accordance with the patimokkha consummate in your behavior sphere of activity train yourselves having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faults if a monk would wish may i be dear pleasing to my fellows in the holy life respected by inspiring to them then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness who does not neglect jhana who is endowed with insight and who frequents empty dwellings if a monk would wish may i be someone who receives robes almsfood lodgings medical requisites for curing the sick then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness who does not neglect jhana who is endowed with insight and who frequents empty dwellings if a monk would wish whatever i use or consume in terms of robes almsfood lodgings medical requisites for curing the sick may that be of great fruit of great benefit to those who provided them then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness who does not neglect jhana who is endowed with insight and who frequents empty dwellings if a monk would wish when my kinsmen relatives who have died passed away recollect me with brightened minds may it be of great fruit of great benefit then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection who is committed to inner tranquility of awareness who does not neglect jhana who is endowed with insight and who frequents empty dwellings if a monk would wish may i be content with whatever robes almsfood lodgings medical requisites for curing the sick are available then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness who does not neglect jhana who is endowed with insight and who frequents empty dwellings if a monk would wish may i be resistant to cold heat hunger thirst to the touch of gadflies mosquitoes wind sun creeping things to abusive hurtful language to bodily feelings that when they arise are painful sharp stabbing fierce distasteful deadly then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness who does not neglect jhana who is endowed with insight and who frequents empty dwellings if a monk would wish may i overcome displeasure and not be overcome by displeasure may i dwell conquering again again any displeasure that has arisen then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness who does not neglect jhana who is endowed with insight and who frequents empty dwellings if a monk would wish may i overcome fear dread and not be overcome by fear dread may i dwell conquering again again any fear dread that have arisen then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness who does not neglect jhana who is endowed with insight and who frequents empty dwellings if a monk would wish may i attain whenever i want without strain without difficulty the four jhanas that are heightened mental states pleasant abidings in the here now then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness who does not neglect jhana who is endowed with insight and who frequents empty dwellings if a monk would wish may i with the ending of mental fermentations remain in the fermentation free awareness release discernment release having directly known realized them for myself in the here now then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness who does not neglect jhana who is endowed with insight and who frequents empty dwellings monks dwell consummate in virtue consummate in terms of the patimokkha dwell restrained in accordance with the patimokkha consummate in your behavior sphere of activity train yourselves having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faults thus was it said and in reference to this was it said friend saariputta my companion has renounced the training and reverted to the lower life this is what happens friend with one whose sense doors are unguarded who is immoderate in eating and not given to wakefulness and how friend does one guard the sense doors in this a monk seeing an object with the eye does not seize hold of either its general appearance or its details because anyone dwelling with the eye faculty uncontrolled could be overwhelmed by cupidity and dejection evil and unwholesome states of mind therefore he practices to control the eye faculty guards it and gains control over it so one guards the sense doors and how friend is one moderate in eating in this a monk takes his food properly considering and how friend is one given to watchfulness in this a monk walks up and down by day and then sits therefore this is how you should train yourselves we will guard the doors of our senses be moderate in eating and given to watchfulness this friend is the way for you to train yourself then vacchagotta the wanderer went to the blessed one and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one now then master gotama is the cosmos eternal that has not been declared by me vaccha the cosmos is eternal well then master gotama is the cosmos not eternal vaccha that too has not been declared by me the cosmos is not eternal then is the cosmos finite is the cosmos infinite is the body the same as the soul is the body one thing and the soul another does the tathagata exist after death does the tathagata not exist after death does the tathagata both exist and not exist after death does the tathagata neither exist nor not exist after death vaccha that too has not been declared by me the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death now master gotama what is the cause what is the reason why when wanderers of other sects are asked in this way they answer that the cosmos is eternal or the cosmos is not eternal or the cosmos is finite or the cosmos is infinite or the body is the same as the soul or the body is one thing and the soul another or the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death yet when master gotama is asked in this way he does not answer that the cosmos is eternal or the cosmos is not eternal or the cosmos is finite or the cosmos is infinite or the body is the same as the soul or the body is one thing and the soul another or the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death vaccha the members of other sects assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form they assume feeling to be the self they assume perception to be the self they assume fabrications to be the self they assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness that is why when asked in this way they answer that the cosmos is eternal or that the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death but the tathagata worthy and rightly self awakened does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form he does not assume feeling to be the self he does not assume perception to be the self he does not assume fabrications to be the self he does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness that is why when asked in this way he does not answer that the cosmos is eternal or that the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death then vacchagotta the wanderer getting up from his seat went to ven maha moggallana and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he addressed the same questions to ven maha moggallana and received exactly the same explanation amazing master moggallana astounding how the meaning and phrasing of the teacher and disciple agree coincide and do not diverge from one another with regard to the supreme teaching just now master moggallana i went to gotama the contemplative and on arrival asked him about this matter and he answered me with the same words the same phrasing as master moggallana amazing master moggallana astounding how the meaning and phrasing of the teacher and disciple agree coincide and do not diverge from one another with regard to the supreme teaching at savatthi there are o monks four nutriments for the sustenance of beings born and for the support of beings seeking birth what are the four edible food coarse and fine secondly sense impression thirdly volitional thought fourthly consciousness of these four nutriments o monks what is their source what is their origin from what are they born what gives them existence these four nutriments o monks have craving as their cause have craving as their origin are born of craving and craving gives them existence and this craving o monks what is its source what its origin from what is it born what gives it existence craving has feeling as its source and origin it is born of feeling and feeling gives existence to it and this feeling o monks what is its source and origin from what is it born and what gives existence to it feeling has sense impression as its source and origin and this sense impression o monks what is its source sense impression has the six sense bases as its source and origin and these six sense bases o monks what is their source the six sense bases have mind and body as their source and origin and this mind and body o monks what is its source mind and body has consciousness as its source and origin and this consciousness o monks what is its source consciousness has kamma formations as its source and origin and these kamma formations o monks what is their source and origin from what are they born what gives existence to them kamma formations have ignorance as their source and origin they are born of ignorance and ignorance gives existence to them thus o monks through ignorance conditioned are kamma formations through the kamma formations conditioned is consciousness through consciousness conditioned is mind and body through mind and body conditioned are the six sense bases through the six sense bases conditioned is sense impression through sense impression conditioned is feeling through feeling conditioned is craving through craving conditioned is clinging through clinging conditioned is becoming through becoming conditioned is birth through birth conditioned are decay and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair thus arises this whole mass of suffering i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery then ven dabba mallaputta went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one now is the time for my total unbinding o one well gone then do dabba what you think it is now time to do then ven dabba mallaputta rising from his seat bowed down to the blessed one and circling him on the right rose up into the air and sat cross legged in the sky in space entering emerging from the fire property he was totally unbound now when dabba mallaputta rose up into the air and sitting cross legged in the sky in space entered emerged from the fire property and was totally unbound his body burned and was consumed so that neither ashes nor soot could be discerned just as when ghee or oil is burned and consumed neither ashes nor soot can be discerned in the same way when dabba mallaputta rose up into the air and sitting cross legged in the sky in space entered emerged from the fire property and was totally unbound his body burned and was consumed so that neither ashes nor soot could be discerned then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed the body broke up perception ceased feelings went cold see also the king pasenadi of kosala dined off a tubful of rice those who always dwell in mindfulness observing measure in the food they eat find that their discomfortnow just then prince sudassana was standing behind the king and the king said to him come my dear sudassana learn this verse from the blessed one and recite it to me when you bring me my dinner and i will arrange for you to be paid a daily allowance of a hundred pence very well your majesty said sudassana after that the king made it a rule to eat no more than a quarter of a tubful of rice no friends i do not say this i am is the body consciousness nor that it is other than the body consciousness yet with regard to the five groups of clinging surely not friend then how would he describe it correctly as the scent of the flower would be the correct explanation in the same way friends i do not say this i am is the body consciousness nor that it is other than the body consciousness yet with regard to the five groups of clinging i am comes to me but i do not consider it as this i am though friends an ariyan disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters so as he dwells thus in contemplation of the rise and fall of the five groups of clinging this subtle remnant from among the five groups of clinging this subtle remnant of the i conceit of the i desire this unextirpated lurking tendency to think i am is brought to an end friends it is like a cloth soiled and stained whose owners give it to the washerman he rubs it smooth with salt earth lye or cow dung then rinses it in clean water now though the cloth has been cleaned and thoroughly purified there still hangs about it unremoved the subtle smell of salt earth lye or cow dung the washerman returns it to the owners who put it away carefully in a sweet smelling box then the smell of salt earth lye or cow dung that still clung to it disappears completely in just the same way friends though an ariyan disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters now when this teaching was thus expounded the hearts of some sixty elders on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth in jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery then an thapi ika the householder went to the blessed one and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him householder are gifts still given in your family gifts are still given in my family lord but they are coarse broken rice cooked with bran accompanied by pickle brine householder regardless of whether a gift is coarse or refined if it is given inattentively disrespectfully not with one s own hand as if throwing it away with the view that nothing will come of it wherever the result of that gift comes to fruition one s mind will not incline to the enjoyment of splendid food will not incline to the enjoyment of splendid clothing will not incline to the enjoyment of splendid vehicles will not incline to the enjoyment of the splendid five strings of sensuality and one s sons daughters slaves servants workers will not listen to one will not lend ear will not make their minds attend for the sake of knowledge why is that because that is the result of inattentive actions householder regardless of whether a gift is coarse or refined if it is given attentively respectfully with one s own hand not as if throwing it away with the view that something will come of it wherever the result of that gift comes to fruition one s mind will incline to the enjoyment of splendid food will incline to the enjoyment of splendid clothing will incline to the enjoyment of splendid vehicles will incline to the enjoyment of the splendid five strings of sensuality and one s sons daughters slaves servants workers will listen to one will lend ear will make their minds attend for the sake of knowledge why is that because that is the result of attentive actions once householder there was a brahman named vel ma and this was the nature of the gift the great gift he gave he gave gold trays filled with silver silver trays filled with gold copper trays filled with gems he gave elephants with gold ornaments gold banners covered with nets of gold thread he gave chariots spread with lion skins tiger skins leopard skins saffron colored blankets with gold ornaments gold banners covered with nets of gold thread he gave milk cows with tethers of fine jute and copper milk pails he gave maidens adorned with jeweled earrings he gave couches spread with long fleeced coverlets white wool coverlets embroidered coverlets rugs of kadali deer hide each with a canopy above red cushions on either side he gave lengths of cloth of finest linen of finest cotton of finest silk now householder if the thought should occur to you perhaps it was someone else who at that time was vel ma the brahman who gave that gift that great gift that s not how it should be seen i was vel ma the brahman at that time i gave that gift that great gift but in that gift there was no one worthy of offerings no one purified that gift if one were to feed one person consummate in view that would be more fruitful than the gift the great gift that vel ma the brahman gave if one were to feed one once returner that would be more fruitful than the gift the great gift that vel ma the brahman gave and if in addition to that one were to feed one person consummate in view and to feed people consummate in view if one were to feed one non returner that would be more fruitful than if one were to feed once returners if one were to feed one arahant that would be more fruitful than if one were to feed non returners if one were to feed one private buddha that would be more fruitful than if one were to feed arahants if one were to feed one tathagata a worthy one rightly self awakened that would be more fruitful than if one were to feed private buddhas if one were to feed a community of monks headed by the buddha that would be more fruitful than if one were to feed a tathagata a worthy one rightly self awakened if one were to have a dwelling built and dedicated to the community of the four directions that would be more fruitful than if one were to feed a community of monks headed by the buddha if one with a confident mind were to go to the buddha dhamma sangha for refuge that would be more fruitful than if one were to have a dwelling built and dedicated to the community of the four directions if one with a confident mind were to undertake the training rules refraining from taking life refraining from taking what is not given refraining from illicit sex refraining from lying refraining from distilled fermented drinks that cause heedlessness that would be more fruitful than if one with a confident mind were to go to the buddha dhamma sangha for refuge if one were to develop even just one whiff of a heart of good will that would be more fruitful than if one with a confident mind were to undertake the training rules if one were to develop even for just a finger snap the perception of inconstancy that would be more fruitful than the gift the great gift that vel ma the brahman gave and in addition to that if one were to feed one person people consummate in view and were to feed one once returner once returners and were to feed one non returner non returners and were to feed one arahant arahants and were to feed one private buddha private buddhas and were to feed a tathagata a worthy one rightly self awakened and were to feed a community of monks headed by the buddha and were to have a dwelling built and dedicated to the community of the four directions and with a confident mind were to go to the buddha dhamma sangha for refuge and with a confident mind were to undertake the training rules refraining from taking life refraining from taking what is not given refraining from illicit sex refraining from lying refraining from distilled fermented drinks that cause heedlessness and were to develop even just one whiff of a heart of good will monks there are these two conditions for the arising of wrong view which two the voice of another monks there are these two conditions for the arising of right view which two the voice of another and appropriate attention these are the two conditions for the arising of right view on one occasion the blessed one was staying near rajagaha at the bamboo grove in the squirrels sanctuary then vassakara the brahman the chief minister of magadha went to the blessed one and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one master gotama we declare a person endowed with four qualities to be one of great discernment a great man which four there is the case where he is learned whatever he hears he immediately understands the meaning of the statement this is the meaning of that statement this is the meaning of that statement he is mindful able to remember recollect what was done said a long time ago he is adept in the affairs of the household life diligent endowed with enough ingenuity in their techniques to manage them and get them done master gotama we declare a person endowed with these four qualities to be one of great discernment a great man if you think that i am worthy of agreement master gotama may you agree with me if you think i am worthy of criticism criticize me i neither agree with you brahman nor do i criticize you i declare a person endowed with four qualities to be one of great discernment a great man which four there is the case brahman where he practices for the welfare happiness of many people and has established many people in the noble method i e the rightness of what is admirable the rightness of what is skillful he thinks any thought he wants to think and doesn t think any thought he doesn t want to think he wills any resolve he wants to will and doesn t will any resolve he doesn t want to will he has attained mastery of the mind with regard to the pathways of thought he attains whenever he wants without strain without difficulty the four jhanas that are heightened mental states pleasant abidings in the here now with the ending of mental fermentations he remains in the fermentation free awareness release discernment release having directly known realized them for himself right in the here now i neither agree with you brahman nor do i criticize you i declare a person endowed with these four qualities to be one of great discernment a great man it s amazing master gotama and astounding how well that has been said by master gotama and i hold master gotama to be endowed with these same four qualities master gotama practices for the welfare happiness of many people and has established many people in the noble method i e the rightness of what is admirable the rightness of what is skillful master gotama thinks whatever thought he wants to think and doesn t think any thought he doesn t want to think he wills any resolve he wants to will and doesn t will any resolve he doesn t want to will he has attained mastery of the mind with regard to the pathways of thought master gotama attains whenever he wants without strain without difficulty the four jhanas that are heightened mental states pleasant abidings in the here now master gotama with the ending of mental fermentations remains in the fermentation free awareness release discernment release having directly known realized them for himself right in the here now well brahman you have taken certainly liberties and spoken presumptuous words but still i will respond to you yes brahman i practice for the welfare happiness of many people and have established many people in the noble method i e the rightness of what is admirable the rightness of what is skillful and yes i think whatever thought i want to think and don t think any thought i don t want to think i will any resolve i want to will and don t will any resolve i don t want to will i have attained mastery of the mind with regard to the pathways of thought and yes i attain whenever i want without strain without difficulty the four jhanas that are heightened mental states pleasant abidings in the here now and yes with the ending of mental fermentations i remain in the fermentation free awareness release discernment release having directly known realized them for myself right in the here now he who knowing declared release for all beings from the snare of death welfare for beings human divine the methodical dhamma seeing hearing which many people grow clear calm who is skilled in what is is not the path his task done fermentation free is called one of great discernment bearing his last body awake i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near then a large number of wandering sectarians went to ven anuradha and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies they sat to one side as they were sitting there they said to ven anuradha friend anuradha the tathagata the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment being described is described with one of these four positions the tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death when this was said ven anuradha said to the wandering sectarians friends the tathagata the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment being described is described otherwise than with these four positions the tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death when this was said the wandering sectarians said to ven anuradha this monk is either a newcomer not long gone forth or else an elder who is foolish inexperienced so the wandering sectarians addressing ven anuradha as they would a newcomer or a fool got up from their seats and left then not long after the wandering sectarians had left this thought occurred to ven anuradha if i am questioned again by those wandering sectarians how will i answer in such a way that will i speak in line with what the blessed one has said will not misrepresent the blessed one with what is unfactual will answer in line with the dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the dhamma will have grounds for criticizing me then ven anuradha went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to the blessed one sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one just now i was staying not far from the blessed one in a wilderness hut then a large number of wandering sectarians came and said to me friend anuradha the tathagata the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment being described is described with one of these four positions the tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death when this was said i said to them friends the tathagata the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment being described is described otherwise than with these four positions the tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death when this was said the wandering sectarians said to me this monk is either a newcomer not long gone forth or else an elder who is foolish inexperienced so addressing me as they would a newcomer or a fool they got up from their seats and left then not long after the wandering sectarians had left this thought occurred to me if i am questioned again by those wandering sectarians how will i answer in such a way that will i speak in line with what the blessed one has said will not misrepresent the blessed one with what is unfactual will answer in line with the dhamma and no one whose thinking is in line with the dhamma will have grounds for criticizing me what do you think anuradha is form constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it proper to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord is feeling constant or inconstant inconstant lord is perception constant or inconstant inconstant lord are fabrications constant or inconstant inconstant lord is consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it proper to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord what do you think anuradha do you regard form as the tathagata no lord do you regard feeling as the tathagata no lord do you regard perception as the tathagata no lord do you regard fabrications as the tathagata no lord do you regard consciousness as the tathagata no lord what do you think anuradha do you regard the tathagata as being in form elsewhere than form in feeling elsewhere than feeling in perception elsewhere than perception in fabrications elsewhere than fabrications in consciousness elsewhere than consciousness no lord what do you think do you regard the tathagata as form feeling perception fabrications consciousness no lord do you regard the tathagata as that which is without form without feeling without perception without fabrications without consciousness no lord and so anuradha when you can t pin down the tathagata as a truth or reality even in the present life is it proper for you to declare friends the tathagata the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment being described is described otherwise than with these four positions the tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death no lord very good anuradha very good i have heard that on one occasion householder the ven ananda is staying near vesali at veluvagamaka then dasama the householder from atthakanagara on completing his business at pataliputta went to ven ananda at veluvagamaka near vesali on arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to ven ananda venerable sir is there a single quality declared by the blessed one the one who knows the one who sees worthy rightly self awakened where the unreleased mind of a monk who dwells there heedful ardent resolute becomes released or his unended fermentations go to their total ending or he attains the unexcelled security from the yoke that he had not attained before yes householder there is and what is that one quality venerable sir there is the case householder where a monk withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation he reflects on this and discerns this first jhana is fabricated intended now whatever is fabricated intended is inconstant subject to cessation staying right there he reaches the ending of the mental fermentations or if not then through this very dhamma passion this dhamma delight and from the total wasting away of the first five fetters this householder is a single quality declared by the blessed one the one who knows the one who sees worthy rightly self awakened where the unreleased mind of a monk who dwells there heedful ardent resolute becomes released or his unended fermentations go to their total ending or he attains the unexcelled security from the yoke that he had not attained before similarly with the second third and fourth jhanas this too householder is a single quality declared by the blessed one the one who knows the one who sees worthy rightly self awakened where the unreleased mind of a monk who dwells there heedful ardent resolute becomes released or his unended fermentations go to their total ending or he attains the unexcelled security from the yoke that he had not attained before similarly with awareness release through compassion through appreciation through equanimity this too householder is a single quality declared by the blessed one the one who knows the one who sees worthy rightly self awakened where the unreleased mind of a monk who dwells there heedful ardent resolute becomes released or his unended fermentations go to their total ending or he attains the unexcelled security from the yoke that he had not attained before similarly with the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness and the dimension of nothingness when this was said dasama the householder from atthakanagara said to ven ananda venerable ananda so dasama the householder from atthakanagara having assembled the community of monks from vesali and pataliputta with his own hands served satisfied them with refined staple non staple foods he presented a pair of cloths to each monk and a triple robe to ven ananda and for ven ananda he had a dwelling built worth five hundred kahapanas well brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed by sense desires and does not know as it really is the way of escape from sense desires that have arisen then he cannot know or see as it really is what is to his own profit nor can he know and see what is to the profit of others or of both himself and others then even sacred words he has long studied are not clear to him not to mention those he has not studied imagine brahman a bowl of water mixed with lac turmeric dark green or crimson dye if a man with good eyesight were to look at the reflection of his own face in it he would not know or see it as it really was in the same way brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed by sense desires then he cannot know or see as it really is what is to his own profit to the profit of others to the profit of both then even sacred words he has long studied are not clear to him not to mention those he has not studied again brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed with ill will then he cannot know or see imagine a bowl of water heated on a fire boiling up and bubbling over if a man with good eyesight were to look at the reflection of his own face in it he would not know or see it as it really was again brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed by sloth and torpor then he cannot know or see imagine a bowl of water covered over with slimy moss and water plants if a man with good eyesight were to look at the reflection of his own face in it he would not know or see it as it really was again brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed by worry and flurry then he cannot know or see imagine a bowl of water ruffled by the wind so that the water trembled eddied and rippled if a man with good eyesight were to look at the reflection of his own face in it he would not know or see it as it really was again brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed by doubt and wavering he cannot know or see imagine a bowl of water agitated stirred up muddied put in a dark place if a man with good eyesight were to look at the reflection of his own face in it he would not know or see it as it really was in the same way brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed by doubt and wavering then he cannot know or see as it really is what is to his own profit to the profit of others to the profit of both then even sacred words he has long studied are not clear to him not to mention those he has studied but brahman when a man dwells with his heart not possessed not overwhelmed by sense desires ill will

world the deva spoke this verse who has not tamed all vain conceits the blessed one replied i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near r jagaha at the bamboo grove the squirrels sanctuary and on that occasion in r jagaha there was a leper named suppabuddha a poor miserable wretch of a person and on that occasion the blessed one was sitting surrounded by a large assembly teaching the dhamma suppabuddha the leper saw the large gathering of people from afar and thought to himself without a doubt someone must be distributing staple or non staple food there why don t i go over to that large group of people and maybe there i ll get some staple or non staple food so he went over to the large group of people then he saw the blessed one sitting surrounded by a large assembly teaching the dhamma on seeing this he realized there s no one distributing staple or non staple food there that s gotama the contemplative sitting surrounded teaching the dhamma why don t i listen to the dhamma so he sat down to one side right there thinking i too will listen to the dhamma then the blessed one having encompassed the awareness of the entire assembly with his awareness asked himself now who here is capable of understanding the dhamma he saw suppabuddha the leper sitting in the assembly and on seeing him the thought occurred to him this person here is capable of understanding the dhamma so aiming at suppabuddha the leper he gave a step by step talk i e he proclaimed a talk on generosity on virtue on heaven he declared the drawbacks degradation corruption of sensuality and the rewards of renunciation then when the blessed one knew that suppabuddha the leper s mind was ready malleable free from hindrances elevated clear he then gave the dhamma talk peculiar to awakened ones i e stress origination cessation path and just as a clean cloth free of stains would properly absorb a dye in the same way as suppabuddha the leper was sitting in that very seat the dustless stainless dhamma eye arose within him whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation having seen the dhamma reached the dhamma known the dhamma gained a foothold in the dhamma having crossed over beyond doubt having had no more perplexity having gained fearlessness independence from others with regard to the teacher s message he got up from his seat and went to the blessed one on arrival having bowed down to the blessed one he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one magnificent lord magnificent just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the blessed one through many lines of reasoning made the dhamma clear i go to the blessed one for refuge to the dhamma and to the community of monks may the blessed one remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life then suppabuddha the leper having been instructed urged roused encouraged by the blessed one s dhamma talk delighting in approving of the blessed one s words got up from his seat bowed down to the blessed one and left circling him to the right not long after his departure he was attacked killed by a cow with a young calf then a large number of monks went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they said to the blessed one lord the leper named suppabuddha whom the blessed one instructed urged roused encouraged with a dhamma talk has died what is his destination what is his future state monks suppabuddha the leper was wise he practiced the dhamma in accordance with the dhamma and did not pester me with issues related to the dhamma with the destruction of the first three fetters he is a stream winner not subject to states of deprivation headed for self awakening for sure when this was said one of the monks said to the blessed one lord what was the cause what was the reason why suppabuddha the leper was such a poor miserable wretch of a person once monks in this very r jagaha suppabuddha the leper was the son of a rich money lender while being escorted to a pleasure park he saw tagarasikhin the private buddhathen on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed as one with eyes having energy would treacherous uneven places so a wise one in the world of life should avoid evil deeds i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion ven a ta ko a athen on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed for someone with no root no soil no leaves how creepers who s fit to criticize him the enlightened one freed from bonds even devas praise him even by brahm he s praised i have heard that on one occasion when this was said just that is the pleasure here my friend where there is nothing felt there are these five strings of sensuality which five forms cognizable via the eye agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing sounds cognizable via the ear smells cognizable via the nose tastes cognizable via the tongue tactile sensations cognizable via the body agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing whatever pleasure or joy arises in dependence on these five strings of sensuality that is sensual pleasure now there is the case where a monk quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation if as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with furthermore there is the case where a monk with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance if as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with furthermore there is the case where a monk with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding if as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with furthermore there is the case where a monk with the abandoning of pleasure stress as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain if as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with furthermore there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving infinite space enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space if as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with furthermore there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space perceiving infinite consciousness enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness if as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with furthermore there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness perceiving there is nothing enters remains in the dimension of nothingness if as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with furthermore there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness enters remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non perception if as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with furthermore there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception enters remains in the cessation of perception feeling and having seen that with discernment his mental fermentations are completely ended so by this line of reasoning it may be known how unbinding is pleasant i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near kosamb at kosita s monastery and on that occasion the blessed one lived hemmed in with monks nuns male female lay followers kings royal ministers sectarians their disciples hemmed in he lived unpleasantly and not in ease the thought occurred to him i now live hemmed in by monks nuns male female lay followers kings royal ministers sectarians their disciples hemmed in i live unpleasantly and not in ease what if i were to live alone apart from the crowd so early in the morning the blessed one adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl robes went into kosamb for alms then having gone for alms in kosamb after the meal returning from his alms round he set his own lodgings in order and carrying his bowl robes without telling his attendant without informing the community of monks alone without a companion left on a wandering tour toward palileyyaka after wandering by stages he reached palileyyaka there he stayed in palileyyaka in the protected forest grove at the root of the auspicious sal tree it so happened that a certain bull elephant was living hemmed in by elephants cow elephants calf elephants baby elephants he fed off grass with cut off tips they chewed up his stash of broken off branches he drank disturbed water and when he came up from his bathing place cow elephants went along banging up against his body hemmed in he lived unpleasantly and not in ease the thought occurred to him i now live hemmed in by elephants cow elephants calf elephants baby elephants i feed off grass with cut off tips they chew up my stash of broken off branches i drink disturbed water and when i come up from my bathing place cow elephants go along banging up against my body hemmed in i live unpleasantly and not in ease what if i were to live alone apart from the crowd so the bull elephant leaving the herd went to palileyyaka to the protected forest grove and the root of the auspicious sal tree to where the blessed one was staying there he kept the grass down in the area where the blessed one was staying and brought drinking water and washing water for the blessed one with his trunk then when the blessed one was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to his awareness before i lived hemmed in by monks nuns male female lay followers kings royal ministers sectarians their disciples hemmed in i lived unpleasantly and not in ease but now i live not hemmed in by monks nuns male female lay followers kings royal ministers sectarians their disciples not hemmed in i live pleasantly and in ease and this train of thought appeared to the awareness of the bull elephant before i lived hemmed in by elephants cow elephants calf elephants baby elephants i fed off grass with cut off tips they chewed up my stash of broken off branches i drank disturbed water and when i came up from my bathing place cow elephants went along banging up against my body hemmed in i lived unpleasantly and not in ease but now i live not hemmed in by elephants cow elephants calf elephants baby elephants i feed off grass with uncut tips they don t chew up my stash of broken off branches i drink undisturbed water when i come up from my bathing place cow elephants don t go along banging up against my body not hemmed in i live pleasantly and in ease then the blessed one realizing his own seclusion and knowing the train of thought in the bull elephant s awareness on that occasion exclaimed this harmonizes mind with mind the great one s with the great one s see also dwelling at by large kaccayana this world is supported by takes as its object a polarity that of existence non existence but when one sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment non existence with reference to the world does not occur to one when one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment existence with reference to the world does not occur to one by large kaccayana this world is in bondage to attachments clingings sustenances biases but one such as this does not get involved with or cling to these attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases or obsessions nor is he resolved on my self he has no uncertainty or doubt that just stress when arising is arising stress when passing away is passing away in this his knowledge is independent of others it s to this extent kaccayana that there is right view everything exists now from the remainderless fading cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications from the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness from the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name form from the cessation of name form comes the cessation of the six sense media from the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact from the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling from the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving from the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging sustenance from the cessation of clinging sustenance comes the cessation of becoming from the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth from the cessation of birth then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair all cease such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress suffering this has come to be this has come to be produced by such nutriment that one sees with true wisdom as it really is and having seen with true wisdom as it really is that this has been produced by such nutriment one is on the way towards revulsion from its production by nutriment towards dispassion and cessation by the cessation of nutriment that what has come to be is bound to cease and how o lord is one a comprehender of dhamma produced by such nutriment that one sees with true wisdom as it really is and having seen with true wisdom as it really is that this has been produced by such nutriment then through revulsion from its production by nutriment through dispassion concerning it and the cessation of it one is liberated without any clinging by the cessation of nutriment that what has come to be is bound to cease that one sees with true wisdom as it really is and having seen with true wisdom as it really is that by the cessation of that nutriment what has come to be is bound to cease then through revulsion from what is liable to cease from dispassion concerning it and the cessation of it one is liberated without any clinging thus o lord is one a comprehender of dhamma well spoken saariputta well spoken said the exalted one monks for anyone who says in whatever way a person makes kamma that is how it is experienced there is no living of the holy life there is no opportunity for the right ending of stress but for anyone who says when a person makes kamma to be felt in such such a way that is how its result is experienced there is the living of the holy life there is the opportunity for the right ending of stress there is the case where a trifling evil deed done by a certain individual takes him to hell there is the case where the very same sort of trifling deed done by another individual is experienced in the here now and for the most part barely appears for a moment now a trifling evil deed done by what sort of individual takes him to hell there is the case where a certain individual is undeveloped in contemplating the body undeveloped in virtue undeveloped in mind undeveloped in discernment restricted small hearted dwelling with suffering a trifling evil deed done by this sort of individual takes him to hell

water in the cup it would become salty because of the salt crystal and unfit to drink now suppose that a man were to drop a salt crystal into the no lord why is that there being a great mass of water in the river ganges it would not become salty because of the salt crystal or unfit to drink in the same way there is the case where a trifling evil deed done by one individual the first takes him to hell and there is the case where the very same sort of trifling deed done by the other individual is experienced in the here now and for the most part barely appears for a moment now a trifling evil act done by what sort of individual takes him to hell there is the case where a certain individual is undeveloped in the body now a trifling evil act done by what sort of individual is experienced in

same sort of trifling deed done by the other individual is experienced in the here now and for the most part barely appears for a moment now a trifling evil deed done by what sort of individual takes

in whatever way a person makes kamma that is how it is experienced there is no living of the holy life there is no opportunity for the right ending of stress but for anyone who says when a person makes kamma to be felt in such such a way that is how its result is experienced there is the living of the holy life there is the opportunity for the right ending of stress contents thus have i heard at one time the lord was staying near savatthi at the jeta grove in anathapindika s monastery now when night was passing a certain devataa lighting up the whole jeta grove with her surpassing beauty approached the lord having drawn near and prostrated herself she stood to one side standing there the devata said those living in the forest peaceful and calm of pure life eating but one meal a day how is it they appear so radiant the lord replied they sorrow not for what is past they have no longing for the future the present is sufficient for them hence it is they appear so radiant by having longing for the future by sorrowing over what is past by this fools are withered up as a cut down tender reed i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near then a certain devata in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entire tapoda hot springs approached ven samiddhi on arrival while standing in the air she addressed him with this verse without having enjoyed sensual pleasures you go for alms monk you don t go for alms after having enjoyed having enjoyed monk then the devata coming down to earth said to ven samiddhi you have gone forth while young monk black haired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life without having played with sensual pleasures enjoy human sensuality monk don t drop what is visible here now in pursuit of what s subject to time my friend i m not dropping what s visible here now in pursuit of what s subject to time i m dropping what s subject to time in pursuit of what s visible here now but monk in what way has the blessed one said that sensual pleasures are subject to time of much stress much despair greater drawbacks and how is this dhamma visible here now not subject to time inviting all to come see pertinent to be known by the wise for themselves i m new my friend not long gone forth only recently come to this dhamma discipline i can t explain it in detail but the blessed one worthy rightly self awakened is staying here in rajagaha at tapoda monastery having gone to him ask him this matter as he explains it that s how you should remember it monk it s not easy for us to go to the blessed one as he is surrounded by other devas of great influence but if you go to the blessed one and ask him this matter i will come along to hear the dhamma responding to the devata as you say my friend ven samiddhi went to the blessed one on arrival he bowed down to the blessed one and sat to one side as he was sitting there he told the blessed one his entire conversation with the devata now lord if that devata was telling the truth she is not far from here when this was said the devata said to ven samiddhi ask monk ask i ve gotten through then the blessed one recited this verse to the devata perceiving in terms of signs beings take a stand on signs not fully comprehending signs they come into the bonds of death but fully comprehending signs one doesn t construe a signifier yet nothing exists for him by which one would say to him no thought occurs if you know this spirit then say so i don t understand lord the detailed meaning of the blessed one s brief statement it would be good if the blessed one would speak in such a way that i would understand the detailed meaning of the blessed one s brief statement whoever construes equal superior or inferior by that he d dispute whereas to one unaffected by these three equal superior do not occur if you know this spirit then say so visesi rd has different thanissaro prefers superior the pts dict has distinguished which can mean either thanissaro tells me that superior implies the existence of its opposite anyway so superior and different both point in the same direction jtb i don t understand lord the detailed meaning of the blessed one s brief statement it would be good if the blessed one would speak in such a way that i would understand the detailed meaning of the blessed one s brief statement lord here s how i understand the detailed meaning of the blessed one s brief statement in all the world every world you should do no evil with speech body or mind having abandoned sensual pleasures mindful alert don t consort with suffering stress with what doesn t pertain to the goal then ven samiddhi replied rouse yourself sit up what good is there in sleeping for those afflicted by disease suffering struck by rouse yourself sit up resolutely train yourself to attain peace go beyond this clinging negligence is a taint and so is the greater negligence growing from it by earnestness and understanding withdraw the arrow of sensual passions i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion a large number of boys on the road between s vatth jeta s grove were hitting a snake with a stick then early in the morning the blessed one adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl robes went into s vatth for alms he saw the large number of boys on the road between s vatth jeta s grove hitting the snake with a stick then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed whoever hits with a stick beings desiring ease when he himself is looking for ease will meet with no ease after death whoever doesn t hit with a stick beings desiring ease when he himself is looking for ease will meet with ease after death the ocean the ocean monks says the ignorant worldling but that is not the ocean in the ariyan discipline that is just a great heap of water a great flood of water the human eye monks is the ocean its impulsion is produced by visible forms whoever withstands its buffeting produced by visible forms is said to have crossed over the brahman the teacher declared he who s crossed this monster teeming sea hardly to be crossed for mighty waves wisdom s his i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion ven mah moggall na was sitting not far from the blessed one his legs crossed his body held erect having mindfulness immersed in the body well established within the blessed one saw ven mah moggall na sitting not far away his legs crossed his body held erect having mindfulness immersed in the body well established within then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed with mindfulness immersed in the body well established restrained with regard to the six contact media continually centered a monk can know unbinding for himself see also i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near then the blessed one as soon as he perceived with his awareness the train of thought in ven sona s awareness as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or bend his outstretched arm disappeared from vulture peak mountain appeared in the cool wood right in front of ven sona and sat down on a prepared seat ven sona after bowing down to the blessed one sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him just now as you were meditating in seclusion didn t this train of thought appear to your awareness of the blessed one s disciples who have aroused their persistence i am one but my mind is not released from the fermentations what if i were to disavow the training return to the lower life enjoy wealth make merit yes lord now yes lord and what do you think when the strings of your vina were too taut was your vina in tune playable no lord and what do you think when the strings of your vina were too loose was your vina in tune playable no lord and what do you think when the strings of your vina were neither too taut nor too loose but tuned yes lord in the same way sona over aroused persistence leads to restlessness overly slack persistence leads to laziness thus you should determine the right pitch for your persistence attune yes lord ven sona answered the blessed one then having given this exhortation to ven sona the blessed one as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or bend his outstretched arm disappeared from the cool wood and appeared on vulture peak mountain then on the attainment of arahantship this thought occurred to ven sona what if i were to go to the blessed one and on arrival to declare gnosis in his presence so he then went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one now it may occur to a certain venerable one to think perhaps it is entirely dependent on conviction that this venerable one is dedicated to renunciation but it should not be seen in that way the monk whose fermentations are ended having fulfilled the holy life does not see in himself anything further to do or anything further to add to what he has done it is because of the ending of passion because of his being free of passion that he is dedicated to renunciation it is because of the ending of aversion because of his being free of aversion that he is dedicated to renunciation it is because of the ending of delusion because of his being free of delusion that he is dedicated to renunciation now it may occur to a certain venerable one to think perhaps it is because he desires gain honor fame that this venerable one is dedicated to seclusion perhaps it is because he falls back on attachment to precepts practices as being essential that he is dedicated to non afflictiveness but it should not be seen in that way the monk whose fermentations are ended having fulfilled the holy life does not see in himself anything further to do or anything further to add to what he has done it is because of the ending of passion because of his being free of passion that he is dedicated to non afflictiveness it is because of the ending of aversion because of his being free of aversion that he is dedicated to non afflictiveness it is because of the ending of delusion because of his being free of delusion that he is dedicated to non afflictiveness it is because of the ending of passion because of his being free of passion because of the ending of aversion because of his being free of aversion because of the ending of delusion because of his being free of delusion that he is dedicated to the ending of craving the ending of clinging sustenance non deludedness even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into the visual range of a monk whose mind is thus rightly released his mind is neither overpowered nor even engaged being still having reached imperturbability he focuses on their passing away and even if powerful sounds aromas flavors tactile sensations even if powerful ideas cognizable by the intellect come into the mental range of a monk whose mind is thus rightly released his mind is neither overpowered nor even engaged being still having reached imperturbability he focuses on their passing away when one s awareness is dedicated to renunciation seclusion non afflictiveness the ending of clinging the ending of craving non deludedness seeing the arising of the sense media the mind is rightly released for that monk rightly released his heart at peace there s nothing to be done nothing to add to what s done as a single mass of rock isn t moved by the wind even so all forms flavors sounds aromas contacts ideas desirable not have no effect on one who is such the mind still totally released focuses on their passing away in recent years more and more westerners have come into contact with theravada buddhist monks and many have become curious about the rules governing the monks life this introduction is meant to help satisfy that curiosity by giving a brief explanation of the rationale behind the rules and their enforcement and by providing summaries of the rules classed according to topic anyone interested in more information on the rules and their interpretation may look into the book readers may also wish to refer to monks there are these five faculties which five the pleasure faculty the pain faculty the happiness faculty the distress faculty the equanimity faculty in dependence on a contact to be experienced as pleasure the pleasure faculty arises being eased one discerns i am eased with the cessation of that very contact to be experienced as pleasure one discerns what was experienced as coming from that the pleasure faculty arising in dependence on a contact to be experienced as pleasure ceases grows still in dependence on a contact to be experienced as pain the pain faculty arises being pained one discerns i am pained with the cessation of that very contact to be experienced as pain one discerns what was experienced as coming from that the pain faculty arising in dependence on a contact to be experienced as pain ceases grows still in dependence on a contact to be experienced as happiness the happiness faculty arises being happy one discerns i am happy with the cessation of that very contact to be experienced as happiness one discerns what was experienced as coming from that the happiness faculty arising in dependence on a contact to be experienced as happiness ceases grows still in dependence on a contact to be experienced as distress the distress faculty arises being distressed one discerns i am distressed with the cessation of that very contact to be experienced as distress one discerns what was experienced as coming from that the distress faculty arising in dependence on a contact to be experienced as distress ceases grows still in dependence on a contact to be experienced as equanimity the equanimity faculty arises being equanimous one discerns i am equanimous with the cessation of that very contact to be experienced as equanimity one discerns what was experienced as coming from that the equanimity faculty arising in dependence on a contact to be experienced as equanimity ceases grows still just as when from the conjunction combining of two fire sticks heat is generated fire produced while from the separation laying down of those fire sticks the heat coming from them ceases grows still in the same way in dependence on a contact to be experienced as pleasure the pleasure faculty arises in dependence on a contact to be experienced as pain the pain faculty arises in dependence on a contact to be experienced as happiness the happiness faculty arises in dependence on a contact to be experienced as distress the distress faculty arises in dependence on a contact to be experienced as equanimity the equanimity faculty arises being equanimous one discerns i am equanimous with the cessation of that very contact to be experienced as equanimity one discerns what was experienced as coming from that the equanimity faculty arising in dependence on a contact to be experienced as equanimity ceases grows still i have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling among the then the devata inhabiting the forest thicket feeling sympathy for the monk desiring his benefit desiring to bring him to his senses approached him and addressed him with this verse from inappropriate attention you re being chewed by your thoughts relinquishing what s inappropriate contemplate appropriately keeping your mind on the teacher the dhamma the sangha your virtues you will arrive at joy rapture pleasure without doubt then saturated with joy you will put an end to suffering stress the monk chastened by the devata came to his senses on one occasion the blessed one was staying near very well then headman i will question you on this matter answer as you see fit what do you think there is the case where a man is one who takes life steals indulges in illicit sex is a liar one who speaks divisive speech harsh speech idle chatter is greedy bears thoughts of ill will holds to wrong views then a great crowd of people gathering congregating would pray praise circumambulate with their hands palm to palm over the heart saying may this man at the break up of the body after death reappear in a good destination the heavenly world what do you think would that man because of the prayers praise circumambulation of that great crowd of people at the break up of the body after death reappear in a good destination the heavenly world no lord no lord so it is with any man who takes life steals indulges in illicit sex is a liar one who speaks divisive speech harsh speech idle chatter is greedy bears thoughts of ill will holds to wrong views even though a great crowd of people gathering congregating would pray praise circumambulate with their hands palm to palm over the heart saying may this man at the break up of the body after death reappear in a good destination the heavenly world still at the break up of the body after death he would reappear in destitution a bad destination the lower realms hell now what do you think there is the case where a man is one who refrains from taking life from stealing from indulging in illicit sex he refrains from lying from speaking divisive speech from harsh speech from idle chatter he is not greedy bears no thoughts of ill will holds to right view then a great crowd of people gathering congregating would pray praise circumambulate with their hands palm to palm over the heart saying may this man at the break up of the body after death reappear in destitution a bad destination the lower realms hell what do you think would that man because of the prayers praise circumambulation of that great crowd of people at the break up of the body after death reappear in destitution a bad destination the lower realms hell no lord no lord so it is with any man who refrains from taking life from stealing from indulging in illicit sex refrains from lying from speaking divisive speech from harsh speech from idle chatter is not greedy bears no thoughts of ill will holds to right view even though a great crowd of people gathering congregating would pray praise circumambulate with their hands palm to palm over the heart saying may this man at the break up of the body after death reappear in a destitution a bad destination the lower realms hell still at the break up of the body after death he would reappear in a good destination the heavenly world when this was said asibandhakaputta the headman said to the blessed one i have heard that on one occasion

for many years with nine openings nine un lanced heads whatever would ooze out from it would be an uncleanliness oozing out a stench oozing out a disgust oozing out whatever would be discharged from it would be an uncleanliness discharging a stench discharging a disgust discharging a boil monks is another word for this body composed of the four properties born of mother father fed on rice porridge subject to inconstancy rubbing massaging breaking up disintegrating it has nine openings nine un lanced heads whatever would ooze out from it would be an uncleanliness oozing out a stench oozing out a disgust oozing out whatever would be discharged from it would be an uncleanliness discharging a stench discharging a disgust discharging for that reason you should become disenchanted with this body monks i don t speak of the wiping out of intentional acts that have been done accumulated without their results having been experienced either in the here now or in a further state hereafter nor do i speak of the act of putting an end to suffering and stress without having experienced the results of intentional acts that have been done accumulated that disciple of the noble ones thus devoid of covetousness devoid of ill will unbewildered alert mindful keeps pervading the first direction what do you think monks if that youth from childhood were to develop the awareness release through good will would he do any evil action no lord not doing any evil action would he touch suffering no lord for when one does no evil action from where would he touch suffering this awareness release through good will should be developed whether one is a woman or a man neither a woman nor a man can go taking this body along death monks is but a gap of a thought away one who practices this awareness release discerns whatever evil action has been done by this body born of action that will all be experienced here in this life it will not come to be hereafter thus developed the awareness release through good will leads to non returning for the monk who has gained gnosis here and has penetrated to no higher release that disciple of the noble ones thus devoid of covetousness devoid of

was limited undeveloped but now this mind of mine is immeasurable well developed and whatever action that was done in a measurable way does not remain there does not linger there what do you think monks if that youth from childhood were to develop the awareness release through equanimity would he do any evil action no lord not doing any evil action would he touch suffering no lord for when one does no evil action from where would he touch suffering this awareness release through equanimity should be developed whether one is a woman or a man neither a woman nor a man can go taking this body

forward by himself moving back by himself say there is no self doer there is no other doer superb venerable gotama superb venerable gotama venerable gotama has made the dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been turned upside down revealing what had been concealed showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark those who have eyes see forms just so the venerable gotama has illuminated the dhamma in various ways i go to venerable gotama as refuge and to the dhamma and to the assembly of monks from this day for as long as i am endowed with breath let venerable gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge on one occasion the blessed one was staying near yes friend we advocate the abandoning of passion the

this is the path this is the way to the abandoning of that passion aversion delusion it is an auspicious path my friend ananda it is an auspicious way to the abandoning of that passion aversion delusion enough for the sake of heedfulness on one occasion the blessed one was staying near as you say lord the monks responded then the blessed one together with a large number of monks went to inspiration peak one of the monks saw the huge drop off from inspiration peak and on seeing it said to the blessed one wow what a huge drop off what a really huge drop off there is monk a drop off more huge frightening than this and which drop off lord is more huge frightening than this any brahmans or contemplatives who do not know as it actually is present that this is stress who do not know as it actually is present that this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress they revel in but as for any brahmans or contemplatives who do know as it actually is present that this is stress who know as it actually is present that this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress they don t revel in therefore monks your duty is the contemplation this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress your duty is the contemplation this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress he who once lived in negligence and then is negligent no more he s the one who brightens this world like the moon released from a cloud who follows up with wholesome deeds unwholesome deeds he may have done he s the one who brightens this world like the moon released from a cloud indeed that youthful bhikkhu who pours himself into the buddha s teaching he s the one who brightens this world like the moon released from a cloud i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one on a wandering tour among the the brahman householders of icchanangala heard it said gotama the contemplative the son of the sakyans having gone forth from the sakyan clan on a wandering tour among the kosalans with a large community of monks has arrived at icchanangala and is staying in the icchanangala forest grove and of that master gotama this fine reputation has spread he is indeed a blessed one worthy rightly self awakened consummate in knowledge conduct well gone a knower of the cosmos an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed teacher of human divine beings awakened blessed he has made known having realized it through direct knowledge this world with its devas maras brahmas its generations with their contemplatives brahmans their rulers common people has explained the dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end has expounded the holy life both in its particulars in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure it is good to see such a worthy one so the brahman householders of icchanangala when the night was gone taking many staple non staple foods went to the gate house of the icchanangala forest grove on arrival they stood there making a loud racket a great racket now at that time lord those are the brahman householders of icchanangala standing at the gate house to the icchanangala forest grove having brought many staple non staple foods for the sake of the blessed one the community of monks lord let the blessed one acquiesce to their offerings now let the one well gone acquiesce now now is the time for the blessed one s acquiescence lord now is the time for the blessed one s acquiescence lord wherever the blessed one will go now the brahmans of the towns countryside will be so inclined just as when the rain devas send rain in fat drops the waters flow with the incline in the same way wherever the blessed one will go now the brahmans of the towns countryside will be so inclined why is that because such is the blessed one s virtue discernment may i have nothing to do with honor nagita and honor nothing to do with me whoever cannot obtain at will without difficulty without trouble as i do the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of self awakening let him consent to this slimy excrement pleasure this torpor pleasure this pleasure of gains offerings fame when one eats drinks chews savors there is excrement urine that is one s reward when one when one is committed to the theme of the unattractive one takes a stance in the loathsomeness of the theme of beauty that is one s reward when one remains focused on the inconstancy of the six media of sensory contact one takes a stance in the loathsomeness of contact that is one s reward when one remains focused on the arising passing away of the five clinging aggregates one takes a stance in the loathsomeness of clinging that is one s reward once the blessed one was dwelling at savatthi in anathapindika s park at that time the venerable sariputta was at nalaka village in the magadha country and was sick suffering gravely ill the novice cunda was his attendant and the venerable sariputta passed away finally through that very illness then the novice cunda took the almsbowl and robes of the venerable sariputta and went to savatthi to the jeta grove anathapindika s park there he betook himself to the venerable ananda and having saluted him seated himself at one side thus seated he spoke to the venerable ananda saying venerable sir the venerable sariputta has had his final passing away these are his bowl and robes on this matter cunda we ought to see the blessed one let us go friend cunda and meet the master having met him we shall acquaint the blessed one with that fact yes venerable sir said the novice cunda they went to see the blessed one and having arrived there and saluted the master they seated themselves at one side then the venerable ananda addressed the blessed one o lord the novice cunda has told me this the venerable sariputta has had his final passing away these are his bowl and robes then o lord my own body became weak as a creeper everything around became dim and things were no longer clear to me when i heard about the final passing away of the venerable sariputta how is this ananda when sariputta had his final passing away did he take from you your portion of virtue or your portion of concentration or your portion of the knowledge and vision of deliverance not so lord when the venerable sariputta had his final passing away he did not take my portion of virtue concentration wisdom deliverance or my portion of the knowledge and vision of deliverance but o lord the venerable sariputta has been to me a mentor teacher and instructor one who rouses inspires and gladdens untiring in preaching dhamma a helper of his fellow monks and we remember how vitalizing enjoyable and helpful his dhamma instruction was have i not taught you aforetime ananda that it is the nature of all things near and dear to us that we must suffer separation from them and be severed from them of that which is born come to being put together and so is subject to dissolution how should it be said that it should not depart that indeed is not possible it is ananda as though from a mighty hardwood tree a large branch should break off so has sariputta now had his final passing away from this great and sound community of bhikkhus indeed ananda of that which is born come to being put together and so is subject to dissolution how should it be said that it should not depart this indeed is not possible therefore ananda be ye an island unto yourself a refuge unto yourself seeking no external refuge with the teaching as your island the teaching your refuge seeking no other refuge then the blessed one said excellent sariputta excellent when a disciple of the noble ones enters remains in seclusion rapture there are five possibilities that do not exist at that time the pain distress dependent on sensuality do not exist at that time the pleasure joy dependent on sensuality do not exist at that time the pain distress dependent on what is unskillful do not exist at that time the pleasure joy dependent on what is unskillful do not exist at that time the pain distress dependent on what is skillful do not exist at that time when a disciple of the noble ones enters remains in seclusion rapture these five possibilities do not exist at that time the buddha addressed the monks the buddha said i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near i crossed over the flood without pushing forward without staying in place but how dear sir did you cross over the flood without pushing forward without staying in place when i pushed forward i was whirled about when i stayed in place i sank and so i crossed over the flood without pushing forward without staying in place that is what the devata said the teacher approved realizing that the teacher has approved of me she bowed down to him circumambulated him keeping him to her right and then vanished right there the devata whatever spirits have gathered here on the earth in the sky may you all be happy listen intently to what i say thus spirits you should all be attentive show kindness to the human race day night they give offerings so being heedful protect them whatever wealth here or beyond whatever exquisite treasure in the heavens does not for us equal the tathagata this too is an exquisite treasure in the buddha by this truth may there be well being the exquisite deathless ending dispassion discovered by the sakyan sage in concentration there is nothing to equal that dhamma this too is an exquisite treasure in the dhamma by this truth may there be well being what the excellent awakened one extolled as pure and called the concentration of unmediated knowing no equal to that concentration can be found this too is an exquisite treasure in the dhamma by this truth may there be well being the eight persons like a dhaniya the cattleman the buddha dhaniya the buddha dhaniya the buddha dhaniya the buddha dhaniya the buddha dhaniya the buddha mara the buddha thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living in the deer park at isipatana the resort of seers near varanasi benares then he addressed the group of five monks monks these two extremes ought not to be practiced by one who has gone forth from the household life what are the two there is addiction to indulgence of sense pleasures which is low coarse the way of ordinary people unworthy and unprofitable and there is addiction to self mortification which is painful unworthy and unprofitable avoiding both these extremes the tathagata the perfect one the noble truth of suffering the noble truth of the origin cause of suffering is this it is this craving thirst which produces re becoming rebirth accompanied by passionate greed and finding fresh delight now here and now there namely craving for sense pleasure craving for existence and craving for non existence self annihilation the noble truth of the cessation of suffering is this it is the complete cessation of that very craving giving it up relinquishing it liberating oneself from it and detaching oneself from it the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering is this it is the noble eightfold path and nothing else namely right understanding right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration this is the noble truth of suffering such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before this suffering as a noble truth should be fully realized such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before this suffering as a noble truth has been fully realized such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before this is the noble truth of the origin cause of suffering such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in

the blessed one when this discourse was thus expounded there arose in the venerable konda a the passion free stainless vision of truth now when the blessed one set in motion the wheel of truth the bhummattha devas the earth deities proclaimed the matchless wheel of truth that cannot be set in motion by recluse brahmana deva mara brahma or any one in the world is set in motion by the blessed one in the deer park at isipatana near varanasi hearing these words of the earth deities all the catummaharajika devas proclaimed the matchless wheel of truth that cannot be set in motion by recluse brahmana deva mara brahma or any one in the world is set in motion by the blessed one in the deer park at isipatana near varanasi these words were heard in the upper deva realms and from catummaharajika it was proclaimed in tavatimsa yama tusita nimmanarati paranimmita vasavatti and the brahmas of brahma parisajja brahma purohita maha brahma parittabha appamanabha abhassara parittasubha appamana subha subhakinna vehapphala aviha atappa sudassa sudassi and in akanittha the matchless wheel of truth that cannot be set in motion by recluse brahmana deva mara brahma or any one in the world is set in motion by the blessed one in the deer park at isipatana near varanasi thus at that very moment at that instant the cry that the wheel of truth is set in motion spread as far as brahma realm the system of ten thousand worlds trembled and quaked and shook a boundless sublime radiance surpassing the effulgence power of devas appeared in the world then the blessed one uttered this paean of joy verily konda a has realized verily konda a has realized the four noble truths thus it was that the venerable konda a received the name a a knonda a konda a who realizes let him admonish instruct thus i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living at benares in the deer park at isipatana the resort of seers there he addressed the bhikkhus of the group of five bhikkhus venerable sir they replied the blessed one said this bhikkhus form is not self were form self then this form would not lead to affliction and one could have it of form let my form be thus let my form be not thus and since form is not self so it leads to affliction and none can have it of form let my form be thus let my form be not thus bhikkhus feeling is not self bhikkhus perception is not self bhikkhus determinations are not self bhikkhus consciousness is not self were consciousness self then this consciousness would not lead to affliction and one could have it of consciousness let my consciousness be thus let my consciousness be not thus and since consciousness is not self so it leads to affliction and none can have it of consciousness let my consciousness be thus let my consciousness be not thus bhikkhus how do you conceive it is form permanent or impermanent impermanent venerable sir now is what is impermanent painful or pleasant painful venerable sir now is what is impermanent what is painful since subject to change fit to be regarded thus this is mine this is i this is my self no venerable sir is feeling permanent or impermanent is perception permanent or impermanent are determinations permanent or impermanent is consciousness permanent or impermanent impermanent venerable sir now is what is impermanent pleasant or painful painful venerable sir now is what is impermanent what is painful since subject to change fit to be regarded thus this is mine this is i this is my self no venerable sir so bhikkhus any kind of form whatever whether past future or presently arisen whether gross or subtle whether in oneself or external whether inferior or superior whether far or near must with right understanding how it is be regarded thus this is not mine this is not i this is not myself any kind of feeling whatever any kind of perception whatever any kind of determination whatever any kind of consciousness whatever whether past future or presently arisen whether gross or subtle whether in oneself or external whether inferior or superior whether far or near must with right understanding how it is be regarded thus this is not mine this is not i this is not my self bhikkhus when a noble follower who has heard the truth sees thus he finds estrangement in form he finds estrangement in feeling he finds estrangement in perception he finds estrangement in determinations he finds estrangement in consciousness when he finds estrangement passion fades out with the fading of passion he is liberated when liberated there is knowledge that he is liberated he understands birth is exhausted the holy life has been lived out what can be done is done of this there is no more beyond that is what the blessed one said the bhikkhus were glad and they approved his words now during this utterance the hearts of the bhikkhus of the group of five were liberated from taints through clinging no more jiva my daughter you cry in the woods come to your senses ubbiri all named jiva have been burned in that charnel ground for which of them do you grieve pulling out completely out the arrow so hard to see embedded in my heart he expelled from me overcome with grief the

burden bearer taking up the burden is suffering in the world putting down the burden is bliss having put down the heavy burden without taking up another burden pulling out craving along with its root one is without hunger fully extinguished i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one on a wandering tour among the so the kalamas of kesaputta went to the blessed one on arrival some of them bowed down to him and sat to one side some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies sat to one side some of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palm to palm over their hearts some of them sat to one side having announced their name clan some of them sat to one side in silence as they sat there the kalamas of kesaputta said to the blessed one lord there are some brahmans contemplatives who come to kesaputta they expound glorify their own doctrines but as for the doctrines of others they deprecate them revile them show contempt for them disparage them and then other brahmans contemplatives come to kesaputta they expound glorify their own doctrines but as for the doctrines of others they deprecate them revile them show contempt for them disparage them they leave us absolutely uncertain in doubt which of these venerable brahmans contemplatives are speaking the truth and which ones are lying of course you are uncertain kalamas of course you are in doubt when there are reasons for doubt uncertainty is born so in this case kalamas don t go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by logical conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought this contemplative is our teacher when you know for yourselves that these qualities are unskillful these qualities are blameworthy these qualities are criticized by the wise these qualities when adopted carried out lead to harm to suffering then you should abandon them for harm lord and this greedy person overcome by greed his mind possessed by greed kills living beings takes what is not given goes after another person s wife tells lies and induces others to do likewise all of which is for long term harm suffering yes lord now what do you think kalamas when aversion arises in a person does it arise for welfare or for harm for harm lord and this aversive person overcome by aversion his mind possessed by aversion kills living beings takes what is not given goes after another person s wife tells lies and induces others to do likewise all of which is for long term harm suffering yes lord now what do you think kalamas when delusion arises in a person does it arise for welfare or for harm for harm lord and this deluded person overcome by delusion his mind possessed by delusion kills living beings takes what is not given goes after another person s wife tells lies and induces others to do likewise all of which is for long term harm suffering yes lord so what do you think kalamas are these qualities skillful or unskillful unskillful lord blameworthy or blameless blameworthy lord criticized by the wise or praised by the wise criticized by the wise lord when adopted carried out do they lead to harm to suffering or not when adopted carried out they lead to harm to suffering that is how it appears to us so as i said kalamas don t go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by logical conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought this contemplative is our teacher when you know for yourselves that these qualities are unskillful these qualities are blameworthy these qualities are criticized by the wise these qualities when adopted carried out lead to harm to suffering then you should abandon them thus was it said and in reference to this was it said now kalamas don t go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by logical conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought this contemplative is our teacher when you know for yourselves that these qualities are skillful these qualities are blameless these qualities are praised by the wise these qualities when adopted carried out lead to welfare to happiness then you should enter remain in them what do you think kalamas when lack of greed arises in a person does it arise for welfare or for harm for welfare lord and this ungreedy person not overcome by greed his mind not possessed by greed doesn t kill living beings take what is not given go after another person s wife tell lies or induce others to do likewise all of which is for long term welfare happiness yes lord what do you think kalamas when lack of aversion arises in a person does it arise for welfare or for harm for welfare lord and this unaversive person not overcome by aversion his mind not possessed by aversion doesn t kill living beings take what is not given go after another person s wife tell lies or induce others to do likewise all of which is for long term welfare happiness yes lord what do you think kalamas when lack of delusion arises in a person does it arise for welfare or for harm for welfare lord and this undeluded person not overcome by delusion his mind not possessed by delusion doesn t kill living beings take what is not given go after another person s wife tell lies or induce others to do likewise all of which is for long term welfare happiness yes lord so what do you think kalamas are these qualities skillful or unskillful skillful lord blameworthy or blameless blameless lord criticized by the wise or praised by the wise praised by the wise lord when adopted carried out do they lead to welfare to happiness or not when adopted carried out they lead to welfare to happiness that is how it appears to us so as i said kalamas don t go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by logical conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought this contemplative is our teacher when you know for yourselves that these qualities are skillful these qualities are blameless these qualities are praised by the wise these qualities when adopted carried out lead to welfare to happiness then you should enter remain in them thus was it said and in reference to this was it said he

wrongly done then here in the present life i look after myself with ease free from hostility free from ill will free from trouble this is the second assurance he acquires if evil is done through acting still i have willed no evil for anyone having done no evil action from where will suffering touch me this is the third assurance he acquires but if no evil is done through acting then i can assume myself pure in both respects this is the fourth assurance he acquires one who is a disciple of the noble ones his mind thus free from hostility free from ill will undefiled pure acquires these four assurances in the here now so it is blessed one so it is o one well gone one who is a disciple of the noble ones his mind thus free from hostility free from ill will undefiled pure acquires four assurances in the here now if there is a world after death if there is the fruit of actions rightly wrongly done then this is the basis by which with the break up of the body after death i will

is the fourth assurance he acquires one who is a disciple of the noble ones his mind thus free from hostility free from ill will undefiled pure acquires these four assurances in the here now it is not by that which is low thus it was heard by me at one time the blessed one was living in the deer park of isipatana near benares there indeed the blessed one addressed the group of five monks form o monks is not self if form were self then form would not lead to affliction and it should obtain regarding form may my form be thus may my form not be thus and indeed o monks since form is not self therefore form leads to affliction and it does not obtain regarding form may my form be thus may my form not be thus feeling o monks is not self if feeling were self then feeling would not lead to affliction and it should obtain regarding feeling may my feeling be thus may my feeling not be thus and indeed o monks since feeling is not self therefore feeling leads to affliction and it does not obtain regarding feeling may my feeling be thus may my feeling not be thus perception o monks is not self if perception were self then perception would not lead to affliction and it should obtain regarding perception may my perception be thus may my perception not be thus and indeed o monks since perception is not self therefore perception leads to affliction and it does not obtain regarding perception may my perception be thus may my perception not be thus mental formations o monks are not self if mental formations were self then mental formations would not lead to affliction and it should obtain regarding mental formations may my perception be thus may my mental formations not be thus and indeed o monks since mental formations are not self therefore mental formations lead to affliction and it does not obtain regarding mental formations may my mental formations be thus may my mental formations not be thus consciousness o monks is not self if consciousness were self then consciousness would not lead to affliction and it should obtain regarding consciousness may my consciousness be thus may my consciousness not be thus and indeed o monks since consciousness is not self therefore consciousness leads to affliction and it does not obtain regarding consciousness may my consciousness be thus may my consciousness not be thus what do you think of this o monks is form permanent or impermanent impermanent o lord now that which is impermanent is it unsatisfactory or satisfactory unsatisfactory o lord now that which is impermanent unsatisfactory subject to change is it proper to regard that as this is mine this i am this is my self indeed not that o lord what do you think of this o monks is feeling permanent or impermanent impermanent o lord now that which is impermanent is it unsatisfactory or satisfactory unsatisfactory o lord now that which is impermanent unsatisfactory subject to change is it proper to regard that as this is mine this i am this is my self indeed not that o lord what do you think of this o monks is perception permanent or impermanent impermanent o lord now what is impermanent is it unsatisfactory or satisfactory unsatisfactory o lord now that which is impermanent unsatisfactory subject to change is it proper to regard that as this is mine this i am this is my self indeed not that o lord what do you think of this o monks are mental formations permanent or impermanent impermanent o lord now those that are impermanent are they unsatisfactory or satisfactory unsatisfactory o lord now those that are impermanent unsatisfactory subject to change is it proper to regard them as they are mine this i am this is my self indeed not that o lord now what do you think of this o monks is consciousness permanent or impermanent impermanent o lord now what is impermanent is that unsatisfactory or satisfactory unsatisfactory o lord now what is impermanent unsatisfactory subject to change is it proper to regard it as this is mine this i am this is my self indeed not that o lord therefore surely o monks whatever form past future or present internal or external coarse or fine low or lofty far or near all that form must be regarded with proper wisdom according to reality thus this is not mine this i am not this is not my self therefore surely o monks whatever feeling past future or present internal or external coarse or fine low or lofty far or near all that feeling must be regarded with proper wisdom according to reality thus this is not mine this i am not this is not my self therefore surely o monks whatever

coarse or fine low or lofty far or near all that consciousness must be regarded with proper wisdom according to reality thus this is not mine this i am not this is not my self o monks the well instructed noble disciple seeing thus gets wearied of form gets wearied of feeling gets wearied of perception gets wearied of mental formations gets wearied of consciousness being wearied he becomes passion free in his freedom from passion he is emancipated being emancipated there is the knowledge that he is emancipated he knows birth is exhausted lived is the holy life what had to be done is done there is nothing more of this becoming this the blessed one said pleased the group of five monks were delighted with the exposition of the blessed one moreover as this exposition was being spoken the minds of the group of five monks were freed of defilements without attachment indeed at that time there were six arahants in the world dwelling at as you say lord the monks replied the blessed one said now what is dependent co arising from birth as a requisite condition comes aging death whether or not there is the arising of tathagatas this property stands this regularity of the dhamma this orderliness of the dhamma this this that conditionality the tathagata directly awakens to that breaks through to that directly awakening breaking through to that he declares it teaches it describes it sets it forth he reveals it explains it makes it plain says look from birth as a requisite condition comes aging death from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth from clinging sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming from craving as a requisite condition comes clinging sustenance from feeling as a requisite condition comes craving from contact as a requisite condition comes feeling from from name form as a requisite condition come the six sense media from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name form from fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications whether or not there is the arising of tathagatas this property stands this regularity of the dhamma this orderliness of the dhamma this this that conditionality the tathagata directly awakens to that breaks through to that directly awakening breaking through to that he declares it teaches it describes it sets it forth he reveals it explains it makes it plain says look from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications what s there in this way is a reality not an unreality not other than what it seems conditioned by this that this is called dependent co arising and what are dependently co arisen phenomena aging death are dependently co arisen phenomena inconstant compounded dependently co arisen subject to ending subject to passing away subject to fading subject to cessation birth is a dependently co arisen phenomenon becoming is a dependently co arisen phenomenon clinging sustenance is a dependently co arisen phenomenon craving is a dependently co arisen phenomenon feeling is a dependently co arisen phenomenon contact is a dependently co arisen phenomenon the six sense media are dependently co arisen phenomena name form is a dependently co arisen phenomenon consciousness is a dependently co arisen phenomenon fabrications are dependently co arisen phenomena ignorance is a dependently co arisen phenomenon inconstant compounded dependently co arisen subject to ending subject to passing away subject to fading subject to cessation these are called dependently co arisen phenomena when a disciple of the noble ones has seen well with right discernment this dependent co arising these dependently co arisen phenomena as they have come to be it is not possible that he would run after the past thinking was i in the past was i not in the past what was i in the past how was i in the past having been what what was i in the past or that he would run after the future thinking shall i be in the future shall i not be in the future what shall i be in the future how shall i be in the future having been what what shall i be in the future or that he would be inwardly perplexed about the immediate present thinking am i am i not what am i how am i where has this being come from where is it bound such a thing is not possible why is that because the disciple of the noble ones has seen well with right discernment this dependent co arising these dependently co arisen phenomena as they have come to be on one occasion the blessed one was staying near yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said it s through direct knowledge that i teach the dhamma not without direct knowledge it s with a cause that i teach the dhamma not without a cause it s with marvels that i teach the dhamma not without marvels that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words and while this explanation was being given the ten thousand fold cosmos quaked conditions of a nation s welfare i have heard lord that this is so so long ananda as this is the case the growth of the vajjis is to be expected not their decline what have you heard ananda do the vajjis assemble and disperse peacefully and attend to their affairs in concord i have heard lord that they do so long ananda as this is the case the growth of the vajjis is to be expected not their decline what have you heard ananda do the vajjis neither enact new decrees nor abolish existing ones but proceed in accordance with their ancient constitutions i have heard lord that they do so long ananda as this is the case the growth of the vajjis is to be expected not their decline what have you heard ananda do the vajjis show respect honor esteem and veneration towards their elders and think it worthwhile to listen to them i have heard lord that they do so long ananda as this is the case the growth of the vajjis is to be expected not their decline what have you heard ananda do the vajjis refrain from abducting women and maidens of good families and from detaining them i have heard lord that they refrain from doing so so long ananda as this is the case the growth of the vajjis is to be expected not their decline what have you heard ananda do the vajjis show respect honor esteem and veneration towards their shrines both those within the city and those outside it and do not deprive them of the due offerings as given and made to them formerly i have heard lord that they do venerate their shrines and that they do not deprive them of their offerings so long ananda as this is the case the growth of the vajjis is to be expected not their decline what have you heard ananda do the vajjis duly protect and guard the arahats so that those who have not come to the realm yet might do so and those who have already come might live there in peace i have heard lord that they do so long ananda as this is the case the growth of the vajjis is to be expected not their decline thereupon the brahman vassakara spoke thus to the blessed one if the vajjis venerable gotama were endowed with only one or another of these conditions leading to welfare their growth would have to be expected not their decline what then of all the seven no harm indeed can be done to the vajjis in battle by magadha s king ajatasattu except through treachery or discord well then venerable gotama we will take our leave for we have much to perform much work to do do as now seems fit to you brahman and the brahman vassakara the chief minister of magadha approving of the blessed one s words and delighted by them rose from his seat and departed welfare of the bhikkhus very well lord and the venerable ananda did as he was requested and informed the blessed one the community of bhikkhus is assembled lord now let the blessed one do as he wishes thereupon the blessed one rose from his seat went up to the hall of audience took his appointed seat there and addressed the bhikkhus thus seven conditions leading to welfare i shall set forth bhikkhus listen and pay heed to what i shall say so be it lord the growth of the bhikkhus is to be expected not their decline bhikkhus so long as they assemble frequently and in large numbers meet and disperse peacefully and attend to the affairs of the sangha in concord so long as they appoint no new rules and do not abolish the existing ones but proceed in accordance with the code of training vinaya laid down so long as they show respect honor esteem and veneration towards the elder bhikkhus those of long standing long gone forth the fathers and leaders of the sangha and think it worthwhile to listen to them so long as they do not come under the power of the craving that leads to fresh becoming so long as they cherish the forest depths for their dwellings so long as they establish themselves in mindfulness so that virtuous brethren of the order who have not come yet might do so and those already come might live in peace so long bhikkhus as these seven conditions leading to welfare endure among the bhikkhus and the bhikkhus are known for it their growth is to be expected not their decline so be it lord the growth of the bhikkhus is to be expected not their decline bhikkhus so long as they do not delight in are not pleased with and are not fond of activities talk sleep and company so long as they do not harbor do not come under the spell of evil desires have no bad friends associates or companions and so long as they do not stop halfway on account of some trifling achievement so long bhikkhus as these seven conditions leading to welfare endure among the bhikkhus and the bhikkhus are known for it their growth is to be expected not their decline so be it lord the growth of the bhikkhus is to be expected not their decline bhikkhus so

long bhikkhus as these seven conditions leading to welfare endure among the bhikkhus and the bhikkhus are known for it their growth is to be expected not their decline so be it lord the growth of the bhikkhus is to be expected not their decline bhikkhus so long as they attend on each other with loving kindness in deed word and thought both openly and in private so long as in respect of what they receive as due offerings even the contents of their alms bowls they do not make use of them without sharing them with virtuous members of the community so long as in company with their brethren they train themselves openly and in private in the rules of conduct which are complete and perfect spotless and pure liberating praised by the wise uninfluenced by mundane concerns and favorable to concentration of mind and in company with their brethren preserve openly and in private the insight that is noble and liberating and leads one who acts upon it to the utter destruction of suffering so long bhikkhus as these six conditions leading to welfare endure among the bhikkhus and the bhikkhus are known for it their growth is to be expected not their decline counsel to the bhikkhus such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdom so be it lord and the blessed one took up his abode at ambalatthika together with a large community of bhikkhus such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdom great becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom so be it lord and the blessed one took up his abode at nalanda together with a large community of bhikkhus and came to stay in the mango grove of sariputta s lion s roar this faith lord i have in the blessed one that there has not been there will not be nor is there now another recluse or brahman more exalted in enlightenment than the blessed one lofty indeed is this speech of yours sariputta and lordly a bold utterance a veritable sounding of the lion s roar but how is this sariputta those arahants fully enlightened ones of the past do you have direct personal knowledge of all those blessed ones as to their virtue their meditation not so lord then how is this sariputta those arahants fully enlightened ones of the future do you have direct personal knowledge of all those blessed ones as to their virtue their meditation their wisdom their abiding and their emancipation not so lord then how is this sariputta of me who am at present the arahant the fully enlightened one do you have direct personal knowledge as to my virtue my meditation my wisdom my abiding and my emancipation not so lord then it is clear sariputta that you have no such direct personal knowledge of the arahats the fully enlightened ones of the past the future and the present how then dare you set forth a speech so lofty and lordly an utterance so bold a veritable sounding of the lion s roar saying this faith lord i have in the blessed one that there has not been there will not be nor is there now another recluse or brahman more exalted in enlightenment than the blessed one for lord all the blessed ones arahants fully enlightened ones of the past had abandoned the five hindrances and lord all the blessed ones arahants fully enlightened ones of the future will abandon the five hindrances the mental defilements that weaken wisdom will well establish their minds in the four foundations of mindfulness will duly cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment and will be fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme enlightenment and the blessed one too lord being at present the arahant the fully enlightened one has abandoned the five hindrances the mental defilements that weaken wisdom has well established his mind in the four foundations of mindfulness has duly cultivated the seven factors of enlightenment and is fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme enlightenment such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdom great becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom come ananda let us go to so be it lord and the blessed one took up his abode at pataligama together with a large community of bhikkhus the fruits of an immoral and a moral life so be it lord and the devotees of pataligama rose from their seats respectfully saluted the blessed one and keeping their right sides towards him departed and the blessed one soon after their departure retired into privacy sunidha and vassakara lord the chief ministers of magadha are building a fortress at pataligama in defence against the vajjis thereupon the blessed one got ready in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe he went together with the community of bhikkhus to the abode of sunidha and vassakara where he took the seat prepared for him and sunidha and vassakara themselves attended on the community of bhikkhus headed by the buddha and served them with choice food hard and soft when the blessed one had finished his meal and had removed his hand from the bowl they took low seats and sat down at one side wherever he may dwell the prudent man ministers to the chaste and virtuous and having to these worthy ones made gifts he shares his merits with the local devas and so revered they honor him in turn are gracious to him even as a mother is towards her own her only son and he who thus enjoys the devas grace and is by them beloved good fortune sees after this the blessed one rose from his seat and departed crossing the ganges they who have bridged the ocean vast leaving the lowlands far behind while others still their frail rafts bind are saved by wisdom unsurpassed those who dwelling on views dispute saying only this is true do they all incur blame or also earn praise there the praise it s such a little thing not at all appeasing he all mogharaja the buddha i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was

kamma as their arbitrator kamma is what creates distinctions among beings in terms of coarseness refinement when this was said subha the student todeyya s son said to the blessed one i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near for us lord the teachings have the blessed one as their root their guide their arbitrator it would be good if the blessed one himself would explicate the meaning of this statement having heard it from the blessed one the monks will remember it in that case monks listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said if wanderers who are members of other sects should ask you what friend are the prerequisites for the development of the wings to self awakening you should answer furthermore the monk is virtuous he dwells restrained in accordance with the patimokkha consummate in his behavior sphere of activity he trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faults this is the second prerequisite for the development of the wings to self awakening furthermore he gets to hear at will easily without difficulty talk that is truly sobering conducive to the opening of awareness i e talk on modesty on contentment on seclusion on non entanglement on arousing persistence on virtue on concentration on discernment on release and on the knowledge vision of release this is the third prerequisite for the development of the wings to self awakening furthermore he keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and for taking on skillful mental qualities he is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities this is the fourth prerequisite for the development of the wings to self awakening furthermore he is discerning endowed with the discernment of arising passing away noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress this is the fifth prerequisite for the development of the wings to self awakening when a monk has admirable friends admirable companions admirable comrades it is to be expected that he will get to hear at will easily without difficulty talk that is truly sobering and conducive to the opening of awareness i e talk on modesty on contentment on seclusion on non entanglement on arousing persistence on virtue on concentration on discernment on release and on the knowledge vision of release when a monk has admirable friends admirable companions admirable comrades it is to be expected that he will keep his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and for taking on skillful mental qualities steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities when a monk has admirable friends admirable companions admirable comrades it is to be expected that he will be discerning endowed with discernment of arising passing away noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress and furthermore monks when the monk is established in these five qualities there are four additional qualities he should develop he should develop contemplation of the unattractive so as to abandon lust he should develop good will so as to abandon ill will he should develop mindfulness of in out breathing so as to cut off distractive thinking he should develop the perception of inconstancy so as to uproot the conceit i am for a monk perceiving inconstancy the perception of not self is made firm one perceiving not self attains the uprooting of the conceit i am unbinding in the here now endowed with five qualities a monk pursuing mindfulness of breathing will in no long time penetrate the unprovoked release which five he is a person who imposes only a little on others one of few duties projects easy to support easily contented with the requisites of life he is a person who eats only a little food committed to not indulging his stomach he is a person of only a little sloth committed to wakefulness he gets to hear at will easily without difficulty talk that is truly sobering conducive to the opening of awareness talk on modesty contentment seclusion non entanglement arousing persistence virtue concentration discernment release and the knowledge vision of release he reflects on the mind as it is released endowed with these five qualities a monk pursuing mindfulness of breathing will in no long time penetrate the unprovoked thus it has been heard by me on one occasion the blessed one was dwelling at also at that time where the blessed one was there venerable bhaddiya the dwarf approached close behind many monks the blessed one saw venerable bhaddiya the dwarf even from afar coming close behind many monks of bad complexion of bad appearance dwarfish of such a form as to be despised by most of the monks monks do you see that monk even from afar coming close behind many monks of bad complexion of bad appearance dwarfish of such a form as to be despised by most of the monks just so venerable sir monks that monk is of great power of great eminence there is no well gained attainment that has not already been attained by that monk for that benefit for which sons of good lineage rightly go forth from home into homelessness that ultimate conclusion of the holy life even in this very life by himself having seen with his own eyes the higher knowledge and having attained he abides and then having understood the meaning of that in that moment he breathed forth this utterance with faultless part adorned in white the one way chariot rolls on see it coming undisturbed with flow cut off unbound when the tathagata worthy rightly self awakened was still just an unawakened bodhisatta when the tathagata worthy rightly self awakened was still just an unawakened bodhisatta this great earth was his great bed furthermore when the tathagata worthy rightly self awakened was still just an unawakened bodhisatta a woody vine growing out of his navel stood reaching to the sky when the tathagata worthy rightly self awakened was still just an unawakened bodhisatta this was the second great dream that appeared to him furthermore when the tathagata worthy rightly self awakened was still just an unawakened bodhisatta white worms with black heads crawling up from his feet covered him as far as his knees when the tathagata worthy rightly self awakened was still just an unawakened bodhisatta this was the third great dream that appeared to him furthermore when the tathagata worthy rightly self awakened was still just an unawakened bodhisatta four different colored birds coming from the four directions fell at his feet and turned entirely white when the tathagata worthy rightly self awakened was still just an unawakened bodhisatta this was the fourth great dream that appeared to him furthermore when the tathagata worthy rightly self awakened was still just an unawakened bodhisatta he walked back forth on top of a giant mountain of excrement but was not soiled by the excrement when the tathagata worthy rightly self awakened was still just an unawakened bodhisatta this was the fifth great dream that appeared to him now when the tathagata worthy rightly self awakened was still just an unawakened bodhisatta and this great earth was his great bed the himalayas king of mountains was his pillow his left hand rested in the eastern sea his right hand in the western sea and both feet in the southern sea this first great dream appeared to let him know that he would awaken to the unexcelled right self awakening when the tathagata worthy rightly self awakened was still just an unawakened bodhisatta and a woody vine growing out of his navel stood reaching to the sky this second great dream appeared to let him know that when he had awakened to the noble eightfold path he would proclaim it well as far as there are human celestial beings when the tathagata worthy rightly self awakened was still just an unawakened bodhisatta and white worms with black heads crawling up from his feet covered him as far as his knees this third great dream appeared to let him know that many white clothed householders would go for life long refuge to the tathagata when the tathagata worthy rightly self awakened was still just an unawakened bodhisatta and four different colored birds coming from the four directions fell at his feet and turned entirely white this fourth great dream appeared to let him know that people from the four castes brahmans noble warriors merchants and laborers having gone forth from the home life into homelessness in the dhamma vinaya taught by the tathagata would realize unexcelled release when the tathagata worthy rightly self awakened was still just an unawakened bodhisatta and he walked back forth on top of a giant mountain of excrement but was not soiled by the excrement this fifth great dream appeared to let him know that the tathagata would receive gifts of robes alms food lodgings medicinal requisites to cure the sick but he would use them unattached to them uninfatuated guiltless seeing the drawbacks of attachment to them and discerning the escape from them when the tathagata worthy rightly self awakened was still just an unawakened bodhisatta these five great dreams appeared to him these four o monks are distortions of perception distortions of thought distortions of view sensing no change in the changing sensing pleasure in suffering assuming self where there s no self sensing the un lovely as lovely gone astray with wrong views beings mis perceive with distorted minds bound in the bondage of mara those people are far from safety they re beings that go on flowing going again from death to birth but when in the world of darkness buddhas arise to make things bright they present this profound teaching which brings suffering to an end when those with wisdom have heard this they recuperate their right mind they see change in what is changing suffering where there s suffering non self in what is without self they see the un lovely as such by this acceptance of right view they overcome all suffering monks there are these four courses of action which four there is the course of action that is unpleasant to do and that when done leads to what is unprofitable there is the course of action that is unpleasant to do but that when done leads to what is profitable there is the course of action that is pleasant to do but that when done leads to what is unprofitable there is the course of action that is pleasant to do and that when done leads to what is profitable now as for the course of action that is unpleasant to do and that when done leads to what is unprofitable one considers it as not worth doing for both reasons because the course of action is unpleasant to do one considers it as not worth doing and because the course of action when done leads to what is unprofitable one considers it as not worth doing thus one considers it as not worth doing for both reasons as for the course of action that is unpleasant to do but that when done leads to what is profitable it is in light of this course of action that one may be known in terms of manly stamina manly persistence manly effort as a fool or a wise person for a fool doesn t reflect even though this course of action is unpleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is profitable so he doesn t do it and thus the non doing of that course of action leads to what is unprofitable for him but a wise person reflects even though this course of action is unpleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is profitable so he does it and thus the doing of that course of action leads to what is profitable for him as for the course of action that is pleasant to do but that when done leads to what is unprofitable it is in light of this course of action that one may be known in terms of manly stamina manly persistence manly effort as a fool or a wise person for a fool doesn t reflect even though this course of action is pleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is unprofitable so he does it and thus the doing of that course of action leads to what is unprofitable for him but a wise person reflects even though this course of action is pleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is unprofitable so he doesn t do it and thus the non doing of that course of action leads to what is profitable for him as for the course of action that is pleasant to do and that when done leads to what is profitable one considers it as worth doing for both reasons because the course of action is pleasant to do one considers it as worth doing and because the course of action when done leads to what is profitable one considers it as worth doing thus one considers it as worth doing for both reasons these are the four courses of action once the blessed one dwelt at vesali in the great forest at the gabled house in the evening after the blessed one had risen from his seclusion he went to the sick room and sat down on a prepared seat being seated he addressed the monks as follows o monks mindfully and clearly comprehending should a monk spend his time this is my injunction to you and how o monks is a monk mindful he dwells practicing body contemplation on the body ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the world he dwells practicing feeling contemplation on feelings ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the world he dwells practicing mind contemplation on the mind having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the world he dwells practicing mind object contemplation on mind objects having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the world so monks is a monk mindful and how o monks is a monk clearly comprehending he applies clear comprehension in going forward and going back in looking straight on and in looking elsewhere in bending and in stretching his limbs in wearing the robes and carrying the alms bowl in eating drinking chewing and savoring in obeying the calls of nature in walking standing sitting falling asleep waking speaking and being silent in all that he applies clear comprehension so monks is a monk clearly comprehending if a monk is thus mindful and clearly comprehending ardent earnest and resolute and a pleasant feeling arises in him he knows now a pleasant feeling has arisen in me it is conditioned not unconditioned conditioned by what even by this body it is conditioned in regard to both body and the pleasant feeling he dwells contemplating impermanence dwells contemplating evanescence dwells contemplating detachment dwells contemplating cessation dwells contemplating relinquishment and in him who thus dwells the underlying tendency to lust in regard to body and pleasant feeling vanishes if a painful feeling arises in him he knows now a painful feeling has arisen in me it is conditioned not unconditioned conditioned by what even by this body it is conditioned and this body indeed is impermanent compounded dependently arisen but if this painful feeling that has arisen is conditioned by the body which is impermanent compounded and dependently arisen how could such a painful feeling be permanent in regard to both the body and the painful feeling he dwells contemplating impermanence dwells contemplating evanescence dwells contemplating detachment dwells contemplating cessation dwells contemplating relinquishment and in him who thus dwells the underlying tendency to resistance in regard to the body and painful feeling vanishes if a neutral feeling arises in him he knows now a neutral feeling has arisen in me it is conditioned not unconditioned conditioned by what even by this body it is conditioned and this body indeed is impermanent compounded dependently arisen but if this neutral feeling that has arisen is conditioned by the body which is impermanent compounded and dependently arisen how could such a neutral feeling be permanent in regard to both the body and the neutral feeling he dwells contemplating impermanence dwells contemplating evanescence dwells contemplating detachment dwells contemplating cessation dwells contemplating relinquishment and in him who thus dwells the underlying tendency to ignorance in regard to body and neutral feeling vanishes if he experiences a pleasant feeling he knows it as impermanent he knows it is not clung to he knows it is not relished if he experiences a painful feeling a neutral feeling he knows it as impermanent he knows it is not clung to he knows it is not relished if he experiences a pleasant feeling he feels it as one unfettered by it if he experiences a painful feeling he feels it as one unfettered by it if he experiences a neutral feeling he feels it as one unfettered by it when having painful feelings endangering the body he knows i have a painful feeling endangering the body when having painful feelings endangering life he knows i have a painful feeling endangering life and he knows after the dissolution of the body when life ends all these feelings which are unrelished will come to final rest even here it is like a lamp that burns by strength of oil and wick and if oil and wick come to an end the flame is extinguished through lack of nourishment similarly this monk knows after the dissolution of the body when life ends all these feelings which are unrelished will come to final rest even here monks kassapa therefore monks you should train yourselves thus we will be content with whatever robe alms lodging medicines we may get we will enjoy the use of these things without clinging or foolish attachment not committing any offense aware of the danger and wisely avoiding it monks i will exhort you by the example of kassapa or one like kassapa so exhorted you should practice to gain the goal on one occasion it s not the case kotthita my friend that aging death are self made that they are other made that they are both self made other made or that without self making or other making they arise spontaneously however from birth as a requisite condition comes aging death now tell me friend sariputta is birth is becoming is clinging sustenance is craving is feeling is contact are the six sense media self made or other made or both self made other made or without self making or other making do they arise spontaneously it s not the case kotthita my friend that the six sense media are self made that they are other made that they are both self made other made or that without self making or other making they arise spontaneously however from name form as a requisite condition come the six sense media now tell me friend sariputta is name form self made or other made or both self made other made or without self making or other making does it arise spontaneously it s not the case kotthita my friend that name form is self made that it is other made that it is both self made other made or that without self making or other making it arises spontaneously however from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name form now tell me friend sariputta is consciousness self made or other made or both self made other made or without self making or other making does it arise spontaneously it s not the case kotthita my friend that consciousness is self made that it is other made that it is both self made other made or that without self making or other making it arises spontaneously however from name form as a requisite condition comes consciousness just now friend sariputta i understood your statement as it s not the case kotthita my friend that name form is self made that it is other made that it is both self made other made or that without self making or other making it arises spontaneously however from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name form but then i understood your statement as it s not the case kotthita my friend that consciousness is self made that it is other made that it is both self made other made or that without self making or other making it arises spontaneously however from name form as a requisite condition comes consciousness now how is the meaning of these statements to be understood very well then kotthita my friend i will give you an analogy for there are cases where it is through the use of an analogy that intelligent people can understand the meaning of what is being said if one were to pull away one of those sheaves of reeds the other would fall if one were to pull away the other the first one would fall in the same way from the cessation of name form comes the cessation of consciousness from the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name form from the cessation of name form comes the cessation of the six sense media from the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact from the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling from the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving from the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging sustenance from the cessation of clinging sustenance comes the cessation of becoming from the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth from the cessation of birth then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair all cease such is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering stress it s amazing friend sariputta it s astounding friend sariputta how well that was said by ven sariputta and i rejoice in ven sariputta s good statements with regard to these topics if a monk teaches the dhamma for the sake of disenchantment dispassion cessation with regard to birth he deserves to be called a monk who is a speaker of dhamma if he practices for the sake of disenchantment dispassion cessation with regard to birth he deserves to be called a monk who practices the dhamma in accordance with the dhamma if through disenchantment dispassion cessation and lack of clinging sustenance with regard to birth he is released then he deserves to be called a monk who has attained unbinding in the here now similarly with becoming clinging sustenance craving feeling contact the six sense media name form and consciousness if a monk teaches the dhamma for the sake of disenchantment dispassion cessation with regard to fabrications he deserves to be called a monk who is a speaker of dhamma if he practices for the sake of disenchantment dispassion cessation with regard to fabrications he deserves to be called a monk who practices the dhamma in accordance with the dhamma if through disenchantment dispassion cessation and lack of clinging sustenance with regard to fabrications he is released then he deserves to be called a monk who has attained unbinding in the here now if a monk teaches the dhamma for the sake of disenchantment dispassion cessation with regard to ignorance he deserves to be called a monk who is a speaker of dhamma if he practices for the sake of disenchantment dispassion cessation with regard to ignorance he deserves to be called a monk who practices the dhamma in accordance with the dhamma if through disenchantment dispassion cessation and lack of clinging sustenance with regard to ignorance he is released then he deserves to be called a monk who has attained unbinding in the here now there are forms monks cognizable via the eye agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing if a monk relishes them welcomes them remains fastened to them he is said to be a monk fettered to forms cognizable by the eye he has gone over to there are sounds cognizable via the ear there are aromas cognizable via the nose there are flavors cognizable via the tongue there are tactile sensations cognizable via the body there are ideas cognizable via the intellect agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing if a monk relishes them welcomes them remains fastened to them he is said to be a monk fettered to ideas cognizable by the intellect he has gone over to mara s camp he has come under mara s power the evil one can do with him as he wills now there are forms cognizable via the eye agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing if a monk does not relish them welcome them or remain fastened to them he is said to be a monk freed from forms cognizable by the eye he has not gone over to mara s camp he has not come under mara s power the evil one cannot do with him as

one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion ven sa g maji had arrived in s vatth to see the blessed one his former wife heard master sa g maji they say has arrived in s vatth taking her small child she went to jeta s grove on that occasion ven sa g maji was sitting at the root of a tree for the day s abiding his former wife went to him and on arrival said to him look after me contemplative a woman with a little son when this was said ven sa g maji remained silent a second time a third time his former wife said to him look after me contemplative a woman with a little son a third time ven sa g maji remained silent then his former wife taking the baby and leaving him in front of ven sa g maji went away saying that s your son contemplative look after him then ven sa g maji neither looked at the child nor spoke to him his wife after going not far away was looking back and saw ven sa g maji neither looking at the child nor speaking to him on seeing this the thought occurred to her the contemplative doesn t even care about his son returning from there and taking the child she left the blessed one with his divine eye purified and surpassing the human saw ven sa g maji s former wife misbehaving in that way then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed at her coming he didn t delight at her leaving he didn t grieve a victor in battle freed from the tie see also who seeks to promote his welfare having glimpsed the state of perfect peace should be able honest and upright gentle in speech meek and not proud contented he ought to be easy to support not over busy and simple in living tranquil his senses let him be prudent and not brazen nor fawning on families also he must refrain from any action that gives the wise reason to reprove him then let him cultivate the thought may all be well and secure may all beings be happy whatever living creatures there be without exception weak or strong long huge or middle sized or short minute or bulky whether visible or invisible and those living far or near the born and those seeking birth may all beings be happy let none deceive or decry his fellow anywhere let none wish others harm in resentment or in hate just as with her own life a mother shields from hurt her own son her only child let all embracing thoughts for all beings be yours cultivate an all embracing mind of love for all throughout the universe in all its height depth and breadth love that is untroubled and beyond hatred or enmity as you stand walk sit or lie so long as you are awake pursue this awareness with your might it is deemed the divine state here holding no more to wrong beliefs with virtue and vision of the ultimate and having overcome all sensual desire never in a womb is one born again there is the case of the sick person who regardless of whether he does or does not receive amenable food regardless of whether he does or does not receive amenable medicine regardless of whether he does or does not receive proper nursing will not recover from that illness there is the case of the sick person who regardless of whether he does or does not receive amenable food regardless of whether he does or does not receive amenable medicine regardless of whether he does or does not receive proper nursing will recover from that illness there is the case of the sick person who will recover from that illness if he receives amenable food amenable medicine proper nursing but not if he doesn t now it is because of the sick person who will recover from that illness if he receives amenable food amenable medicine proper nursing but not if he doesn t that food for the sick has been allowed medicine for the sick has been allowed nursing for the sick has been allowed and it is because there is this sort of sick person that the other sorts of sick persons are to be nursed as well these are the three types of sick people to be found existing in the world in the same way there is the case of the person who regardless of whether he does or doesn t get to see the tathagata regardless of whether he does or doesn t get to hear the dhamma discipline proclaimed by the tathagata will not alight on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities there is the case of the person who regardless of whether he does or doesn t get to see the tathagata regardless of whether he does or doesn t get to hear the dhamma discipline proclaimed by the tathagata will alight on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities there is the case of the person who will alight on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities if he gets to see the tathagata and gets to hear the dhamma discipline proclaimed by the tathagata but not if he doesn t now it is because of the person who will alight on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities if he gets to see the tathagata and gets to hear the dhamma discipline proclaimed by the tathagata but not if he doesn t that the teaching of the dhamma has been allowed and it is because there is this sort of person that the other sorts of persons are to be taught the dhamma as well on the chance that they may actually turn out to need and benefit from the teaching these are the three types of people like the three types of sick people to be found existing in the world i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at and this monks is the noble truth of the origination of stress the craving that makes for further becoming accompanied by passion delight relishing now here now there i e craving for sensual pleasure craving for becoming craving for non becoming and this monks is the noble truth of the cessation of stress the remainderless fading cessation renunciation relinquishment release letting go of that very craving and this monks is the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress precisely this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration vision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before this is the noble truth of stress vision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before this noble truth of stress is to be comprehended vision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before this noble truth of stress has been comprehended vision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before this is the noble truth of the

leading to the cessation of stress this noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress is to be developed this noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress has been developed and monks as long as this my three round twelve permutation knowledge vision concerning these four noble truths as they have come to be was not pure i did not claim to have directly awakened to the right self awakening unexcelled in the cosmos with its deities maras brahmas with its contemplatives brahmans its royalty commonfolk but as soon as this my three round twelve permutation knowledge vision concerning these four noble truths as they have come to be was truly pure then i did claim to have directly awakened to the right self awakening unexcelled in the cosmos with its deities maras brahmas with its contemplatives brahmans its royalty commonfolk knowledge vision arose in me unprovoked is my release this is the last birth there is now no further becoming that is what the blessed one said gratified the group of five monks delighted at his words and while this explanation was being given and when the blessed one had set the wheel of dhamma in motion the earth devas cried out at varanasi in the game refuge at isipatana the blessed one has set in motion the unexcelled wheel of dhamma that cannot be stopped by brahman or contemplative deva so in that moment that instant the cry shot right up to the brahma worlds and this ten thousand fold cosmos shivered quivered quaked while a great measureless radiance appeared in the cosmos surpassing the effulgence of the devas then the blessed one exclaimed so you really know konda a so you really know and that is how ven konda a acquired the name a a konda a konda a who knows i have heard that on one occasion now at that time then in the early morning ven ananda having put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe went into rajagaha for alms the thought occurred to him it s too early to go for alms in rajagaha what if i were to go to the brahman so ven ananda sat down on the seat made ready moggallana the guardsman taking a lower seat sat to one side no brahman there isn t any one monk endowed in each every way with the qualities with which the blessed one worthy rightly self awakened was endowed for the blessed one was the arouser of the unarisen path the begetter of the unbegotten path the expounder of the unexpounded path the knower of the path the expert with regard to the path adept at the path and now his disciples follow the path and become endowed with it after him and then ven ananda s discussion with moggallana the guardsman was interrupted in mid course for the brahman just now brahman moggallana the guardsman said to me master ananda is there any one monk endowed in each every way with the qualities with which master gotama worthy rightly self awakened was endowed and when this was said i said to him no brahman there isn t any one monk endowed in each every way with the qualities with which the blessed one worthy rightly self awakened was endowed for the blessed one was the arouser of the unarisen path the begetter of the unbegotten path the expounder of the unexpounded path the knower of the path the expert with regard to the path adept at the path and now his disciples follow the path and become endowed with it after him this was my discussion with the brahman moggallana the guardsman that was interrupted in mid course when you arrived master ananda is there any one monk appointed by master gotama with the words he will be your arbitrator after i am gone to whom you now turn no brahman there isn t any one monk appointed by the blessed one the one who knows the one who sees worthy rightly self awakened with the words he will be your arbitrator after i am gone to whom we now turn then is there any one monk authorized by the sangha and appointed by a large body of elder monks with the words he will be our arbitrator after the blessed one is gone to whom you now turn no brahman there isn t any one monk authorized by the sangha and appointed by a large body of elder monks with the words he will be our arbitrator after the blessed one is gone to whom we now turn being thus without an arbitrator master ananda what is the reason for your concord it s not the case brahman that we re without an arbitrator we have an arbitrator the dhamma is our arbitrator when asked master ananda is there any one monk appointed by master gotama with the words he will be your arbitrator after i am gone to whom you now turn you said no brahman there isn t any one monk appointed by the blessed one to whom we now turn when asked then is there any one monk authorized by the sangha to whom you now turn you said no brahman there isn t any one monk authorized by the sangha to whom we now turn when asked being thus without an arbitrator master ananda what is the reason for your concord you said it s not the case brahman that we re without an arbitrator we have an arbitrator the dhamma is our arbitrator now how is the meaning of what you have said to be understood brahman there is a training rule laid down by the blessed one the one who knows the one who sees worthy rightly self awakened a patimokkha that has been codified on the uposatha day all of us who live dependent on a single township gather together in one place having gathered together we invite the one to whom it falls to recite the patimokkha if while he is reciting a monk remembers an offense or transgression we deal with him in accordance with the dhamma in accordance with what has been instructed is there master ananda any one monk you now honor respect revere venerate on whom honoring respecting you live in dependence yes brahman there is a monk we now honor respect revere venerate on whom honoring respecting we live in dependence when asked master ananda is there any one monk appointed by master gotama with the words he will be your arbitrator after i am gone to whom you now turn you said no brahman there isn t any one monk appointed by the blessed one to whom we now turn when asked then is there any one monk authorized by the sangha to whom you now turn you said no brahman there isn t any one monk authorized by the sangha to whom we now turn when asked is there master ananda any one monk you now honor respect revere venerate on whom honoring respecting you live in dependence you said yes brahman there is a monk we now honor respect revere venerate on whom honoring respecting we live in dependence now how is the meaning of what you have said to be understood brahman there are there is the case where a monk is virtuous he dwells restrained in accordance with the patimokkha consummate in his behavior sphere of activity he trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faults he has heard much has retained what he has heard has stored what he has heard whatever teachings are admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end that in their meaning expression proclaim the holy life entirely perfect pure those he has listened to often retained discussed accumulated examined with his mind and well penetrated in terms of his views he is content with robes alms food lodgings medicinal requisites for curing the sick he attains whenever he wants without

if it were dry land sitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged bird with his hand he touches strokes even the sun moon so mighty powerful he exercises influence with his body even as far as the brahma worlds he hears by means of the divine ear element purified surpassing the human both kinds of sounds divine human whether near or far he knows the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with his own awareness he discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passion he discerns a mind with aversion as

expansion recollecting there i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose there there too i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose here thus he remembers his manifold past lives in their modes details he sees by means of the divine eye purified surpassing the human beings passing away and re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior superior beautiful ugly fortunate unfortunate in accordance with their kamma these beings who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell but these beings who were endowed with good conduct of body speech mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views with the break up of

discerns how they are inferior superior beautiful ugly fortunate unfortunate in accordance with their kamma through the ending of the mental fermentations he remains in the fermentation free awareness release discernment release having known made them manifest for himself right in the here now these brahman are the ten inspiring qualities expounded by the blessed one the one who knows the one who sees worthy rightly self awakened in whoever among us these ten qualities are found we now honor respect revere venerate him honoring respecting him we live in dependence on him when this was said the brahman vassakara the magadhan administrator turned to general upananda and said what do you think general do these venerable ones honor what should be honored respect what should be respected revere what should be revered venerate what should be venerated of course they honor what should be honored respect what should be respected revere what should be revered venerate what should be venerated for if they did not honor respect revere or venerate a person like this then what sort of person would they honor respect revere venerate on what sort of person honor respecting would they live in dependence then the brahman vassakara the magadhan administrator said to ven ananda but where are you staying now master ananda i am now staying at the bamboo grove brahman i trust master ananda that the bamboo grove is delightful quiet free of noise with an air of isolation remote from human beings appropriate for retreat certainly brahman the bamboo grove is delightful quiet free of noise with an air of isolation remote from human beings appropriate for retreat because of guardians protectors like yourself certainly master ananda the bamboo grove is delightful quiet free of noise with an air of isolation remote from human beings appropriate for retreat because of venerable ones who are endowed with mental absorption jhana who make mental absorption their habit you venerable ones are both endowed with mental absorption make mental absorption your habit once ven ananda master gotama was staying near he dwells with his awareness overcome by ill will he dwells with his awareness overcome by sloth drowsiness he dwells with his awareness overcome by restlessness anxiety he dwells with his awareness overcome by uncertainty seized with uncertainty he does not discern the escape as it actually is present from uncertainty once it has arisen making that uncertainty the focal point he absorbs himself with it besorbs resorbs supersorbs himself with it this is the sort of mental absorption that the blessed one did not praise and what sort of mental absorption did he praise there is the case where a monk quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress he enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain this is the sort of mental absorption that the blessed one praised it would seem ven ananda that master gotama criticized the mental absorption that deserves criticism and praised that which deserves praise well now master ananda i must be going many are my duties many the things i must do then do brahman what you think it is now time to do so the brahman vassakara the magadhan administrator delighting rejoicing in what ven ananda had said got up from his seat left then not long after he had left moggallana the guardsman said to ven ananda master ananda you still haven t answered what i asked you didn t i just tell you brahman there isn t any one monk endowed in each every way with the qualities with which the blessed one worthy rightly self awakened was endowed for the blessed one was the arouser of the unarisen path the begetter of the unbegotten path the expounder of the unexpounded path the knower of the path the expert with regard to the path adept at the path and now his disciples follow the path and become endowed with it after him live with a protector monks and not without a protector he suffers one who lives without a protector and these ten are qualities creating a protector which ten there is the case where a monk is virtuous he dwells restrained in accordance with the patimokkha consummate in his behavior sphere of activity he trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faults and the fact that he is virtuous seeing danger in the slightest faults is a quality creating a protector then again the monk has heard much has retained what he has heard has stored what he has heard whatever teachings are admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end that in their meaning expression proclaim the holy life that is entirely complete pure those he has listened to often retained discussed accumulated examined with his mind well penetrated in terms of his views and the fact that he has heard much well penetrated in terms of his views is a quality creating a protector then again the monk has admirable friends admirable companions admirable comrades and the fact that he has admirable friends admirable companions admirable comrades is a quality creating a protector then again the monk is easy to speak to endowed with qualities that make him easy to speak to patient respectful to instruction and the fact that he is easy to speak to respectful to instruction is a quality creating a protector then again the monk is adept at the various affairs involving his fellows in the holy life is vigorous quick witted in the techniques involved in them is up to doing them or arranging to get them done and the fact that he is adept at doing them or arranging to get them done is a quality creating a protector then again the monk is one who desires the dhamma endearing in his conversation greatly rejoicing in the higher dhamma higher discipline and the fact that he is one who desires the dhamma endearing in his conversation greatly rejoicing in the higher dhamma higher discipline is a quality creating a protector then again the monk keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful qualities and for taking on skillful qualities he is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualities and the fact that he keeps his persistence aroused not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualities is a quality creating a protector then again the monk is content with any old robe cloth at all any old alms food any old lodging any old medicinal requisites for curing sickness at all and the fact that he is content with any old robe cloth at all any old alms food any old lodging any old medicinal requisites for curing sickness at all is a quality creating a protector then again the monk is mindful highly meticulous remembering able to call to mind even things that were done said long ago and the fact that he is mindful highly meticulous remembering able to call to mind even things that were done said long ago is a quality creating a protector then again the monk is discerning endowed with discernment of arising passing away noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress and the fact that the monk is discerning endowed with discernment of arising passing away noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress is a quality creating a protector live with a protector monks and not without a protector he suffers one who lives without a protector these are the ten qualities creating a protector at should consciousness when standing stand attached to feeling supported by feeling as its object landing on feeling watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase proliferation should consciousness when standing stand attached to perception supported by perception as its object landing on perception watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase proliferation should consciousness when standing stand attached to fabrications supported by fabrications as its object landing on fabrications watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase proliferation were someone to say i will describe a coming a going a passing away an arising a growth an increase or a proliferation of consciousness apart from form from feeling from perception from fabrications that would be impossible if a monk abandons passion for the property of form if a monk abandons passion for the property of feeling if a monk abandons passion for the property of perception if a monk abandons passion for the property of fabrications if a monk abandons passion for the property of consciousness then owing to the abandonment of passion the support is cut off and there is no landing of consciousness consciousness thus not having landed not increasing not concocting is released owing to its release it is steady owing to its steadiness it is contented owing to its contentment it is not agitated not agitated he the monk is totally unbound right within he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near then he went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him householder your faculties are not those of one who is steady in his own mind there is an aberration in your faculties lord how could there not be an aberration in my faculties my dear beloved little son my only child has died because of his death i have no desire to work or to eat i keep going to the cemetery and crying out where have you gone my only little child where have you gone my only little child that s the way it is householder that s the way it is for sorrow lamentation pain distress despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear but lord who would ever think that sorrow lamentation pain distress despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear happiness joy are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear so the householder not delighting in the blessed one s words rejecting the blessed one s words got up from his seat and left now at that time a large number of gamblers were playing dice not far from the blessed one so the householder went to them and on arrival said to them just now venerable sirs i went to gotama the contemplative and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as i was sitting there gotama the contemplative said to me householder your faculties are not those of one who is steady in his own mind there is an aberration in your faculties when this was said i said to him lord how could there not be an aberration in my faculties my dear beloved little son my only child has died because of his death i have no desire to work or to eat i keep going to the cemetery and crying out where have you gone my only little child where have you gone my only little child that s the way it is householder that s the way it is for sorrow lamentation pain distress despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear but lord who would ever think that sorrow lamentation pain distress despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear happiness joy are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear so not delighting in the words of gotama the contemplative rejecting them i got up from my seat and left that s the way it is householder said the gamblers that s the way it is happiness joy are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear so the householder left thinking i agree with the gamblers eventually word of this conversation made its way into the king s inner chambers then if that was said by the blessed one great king then that s the way it is no matter what gotama the contemplative says mallika endorses it if that was said by the blessed one great king then that s the way it is just as no matter what his teacher says a pupil endorses it that s the way it is teacher that s the way it is in the same way no matter what gotama the contemplative says mallika endorses it if that was said by the blessed one great king then that s the way it is go away mallika out of my sight then queen mallika called for the brahman yes madam the brahman nalijangha responded to queen mallika going to the blessed one on arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with the blessed one after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one master gotama queen mallika shows reverence with her head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness affliction are carefree strong living in comfort and she says further lord did the blessed one say that sorrow lamentation pain distress despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear that s the way it is brahman that s the way it is sorrow lamentation pain distress despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear and it s through this sequence of events that it may be understood how sorrow lamentation pain distress despair are born from one who is dear come springing from one who is dear once in this same savatthi there was a woman whose mother died owing to her mother s death she went mad out of her mind and wandering from street to street crossroads to crossroads would say have you seen my mother have you seen my mother it s through this sequence of events that it may be understood how sorrow lamentation pain

householder which three there is the case where a farming householder quickly gets his field well plowed well harrowed having quickly gotten his field well plowed well harrowed he quickly plants the seed having quickly planted the seed he quickly lets in the water then lets it out these are the three urgent duties of a farming householder now that farming householder does not have the power or might to say may my crops spring up today may the grains appear tomorrow and may they ripen the next day but when the time has come the farming householder s crops spring up the grains appear and they ripen in the same way there are these three urgent duties of a monk which three the undertaking of heightened virtue the undertaking of heightened mind the undertaking of heightened discernment these are the three urgent duties of a monk now that monk does not have the power or might to say may my mind be released from fermentations through lack of clinging sustenance today or tomorrow or the next day but when the time has come his mind is released from fermentations through lack of clinging sustenance thus monks you should train yourselves strong will be our desire for the undertaking of heightened virtue strong will be our desire for the undertaking of heightened mind strong will be our desire for the undertaking of heightened discernment that s how you should train yourselves whatever beings non humans are assembled here terrestrial or celestial may they all have peace of mind and may they listen attentively to these words o beings listen closely may you all radiate loving kindness to those human beings who by day and night bring offerings to you offer merit to you wherefore protect them with diligence whatever treasure there be either here or in the world beyond whatever precious jewel there be in the heavenly worlds there is nought comparable to the tathagata the perfect one this precious jewel is the buddha that cessation that detachment that deathlessness nibbana supreme the calm and collected sakyan sage the buddha had realized there is nought comparable to this nibbana dhamma this precious jewel is the dhamma the supreme buddha extolled a path of purity the noble eightfold path calling it the path which unfailingly brings concentration there is nought comparable to this concentration this precious jewel is the dhamma by this asseveration of the truth may there be happiness the eight persons extolled by virtuous men constitute four pairs they are the disciples of the buddha and are worthy of offerings gifts given to them yield rich

attained arahantship encountering the deathless they enjoy the peace of nibbana freely obtained as a post deep planted in the earth stands unshaken by the winds from the four quarters so too i declare is the righteous man who comprehends with wisdom the noble truths this precious jewel is the sangha by this asseveration of the truth may there be happiness those who realized the noble truths well taught by him who is profound in wisdom the buddha even though they may be exceedingly heedless they will not take an eighth existence in the realm of sense spheres with his gaining of insight he abandons three states of mind namely self illusion doubt and indulgence in meaningless rites and rituals should there be any he is also fully freed from the four states of woe and therefore incapable of committing the six major wrongdoings any evil action he may still do by deed word or thought he is incapable of concealing it since it has been proclaimed that such concealing is impossible for one who has seen the path of nibbana as the woodland groves though in the early heat of the summer month are crowned with blossoming flowers even so is the sublime dhamma leading to the calm of nibbana which is taught by the buddha for the highest good this precious jewel is the buddha by this asseveration of the truth may there be happiness the peerless excellent one the buddha the knower of

may there be happiness i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near r jagaha at the bamboo grove the squirrels sanctuary and on that occasion two factions in r jagaha were infatuated with a certain courtesan their minds enthralled arguing quarreling disputing they attacked one another with fists attacked one another with clods of dirt attacked one another with sticks attacked one another with knives so that they fell into death or death like pain then in the early morning a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and carrying their bowls robes went into s vatth for alms having gone for alms in s vatth after the meal returning from their alms round they went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they said to the blessed one at present two factions in r jagaha are infatuated with a certain courtesan their minds enthralled arguing quarreling disputing they attack one another with fists attack one another with clods of dirt attack one another with sticks attack one another with knives so that they fall into death or death like pain then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed what s been attained what s to be attained are both strewn with dust by one who trains in line with the afflicted any precept practice life whose essence is training and the holy life whose essence is service this is one extreme any who say there s no harm in sensual desires this the second extreme both of these extremes cause the growth of cemeteries and cemeteries cause views to grow not directly knowing these two extremes some fall short some run too far stricken by sharp wind like pains you monk living in the forest grove harsh with limited range for alms what what will you do suffusing my body with abundant rapture joy enduring what s harsh i ll stay in the grove developing the frames of reference strengths faculties the factors for awakening i ll stay in the grove reflecting on those who are resolute their persistence aroused constantly firm in their effort united in concord i ll stay in the grove recollecting the one self awakened self tamed centered untiring both day night i ll stay in the grove i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion the blessed one was instructing urging rousing encouraging the monks with dhamma talk concerned with unbinding the monks receptive attentive focusing their entire awareness lending ear listened to the dhamma then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed there is that dimension monks where there is neither earth nor water nor fire nor wind neither dimension of the infinitude of space nor dimension of the infinitude of consciousness nor dimension of nothingness nor dimension of neither perception nor non perception neither this world nor the next world nor sun nor moon and there i say there is neither coming nor going nor staying neither passing away nor arising unestablished see also alternate translation this was said by the lord bhikkhus there are these three elements of escape what three the escape from sensual desires that is renunciation the escape from form that is the formless and the escape from whatever has come to be from whatever is conditioned and dependently arisen that is cessation these bhikkhus are the three elements of escape having known the escape from sensual desires and the overcoming of forms one whose energy is always ardent reaches the stilling of all formations such a bhikkhu who sees rightly is thereby well released accomplished in knowledge at peace that sage has overcome all bonds then the blessed one said to as you say lord ven ananda responded to the blessed one responding as you say lord ven ananda prepared a bed between the twin sal trees with its head to the north then the blessed one lay down on his right side in the lion s sleeping posture with one foot on top of the other mindful alert now at that time the twin sal trees were in full bloom even though it was not the time for flowering they showered strewed sprinkled on the tathagata s body in homage to him heavenly coral tree blossoms fell from the sky showering strewing sprinkling the tathagata s body in homage to him heavenly sandalwood powder fell from the sky showering strewing sprinkling the tathagata s body in homage to him heavenly music was playing in the sky in homage to the tathagata heavenly songs were sung in the sky in homage to the tathagata then the blessed one said to ven ananda ananda the twin sal trees are in full bloom even though it s not the flowering season they shower strew sprinkle on the tathagata s body in homage to him heavenly coral tree blossoms are falling from the sky heavenly sandalwood powder is falling from the sky heavenly music is playing in the sky heavenly songs are sung in the sky in homage to the tathagata but it is not to this extent that a tathagata is worshipped honored respected venerated or paid homage to rather the monk nun male lay follower or female lay follower who keeps practicing the dhamma in accordance with the dhamma who keeps practicing masterfully who lives in accordance with the dhamma that is the person who worships honors respects venerates pays homage to the tathagata with the highest homage so you should train yourselves we will keep practicing the dhamma in accordance with the dhamma we will keep practicing masterfully we will live in accordance with the dhamma now at that time then ven ananda said to the blessed one for a long time now this ven upavana has been an attendant to the blessed one staying near him and traveling with him but now in his final hour he dismisses him saying go away monk don t stand in front of me now what is the reason what is the cause why the blessed one dismisses him saying go away monk don t stand in front of me ananda most of the devatas from ten world systems have gathered in order to see the tathagata for twelve leagues all around upavattana the mallans sal grove near kusinara there is not the space even of the tip of a horse tail hair that is not occupied by eminent devatas the devatas ananda are complaining we have come a long distance to see the tathagata but lord what is the state of the devatas the blessed one is referring to ananda there are devatas who perceive space to be earth tearing at their hair they are weeping uplifting their arms they are weeping as if their feet were cut out from under them in the past lord the monks in all directions after ending the rains retreat came to see the tathagata thus we got to see attend to the monks who inspire the heart but now after the blessed one is gone we won t get to see or attend to the monks who inspire the heart lord what course should we follow with regard to womenfolk not seeing ananda but when there is seeing lord what course should be followed not addressing ananda but when we are addressed what course should be followed mindfulness should be established ananda and lord what course should we follow with regard to the tathagata s body you are not to be concerned about the tathagata s funeral please ananda strive for the true goal be committed to the true goal dwell heedful ardent resolute for the sake of the true goal there are wise nobles brahmans householders who are highly confident in the tathagata they will conduct the tathagata s funeral but lord what course should be followed with regard to the tathagata s body the course they follow with regard to the body of a wheel turning monarch ananda is the course that should be followed with regard to the body of the tathagata and what lord is the course they follow with regard to the body of a wheel turning monarch ananda they wrap the body of a wheel turning monarch in new linen cloth having wrapped it in new linen cloth they wrap it in teased cotton wool having wrapped it in teased cotton wool they wrap it in new linen cloth having done this times they place the body in an iron oil vat cover it with an iron lid make a pyre composed totally of perfumed substances and cremate the body then they build a burial mound for the wheel turning monarch at a great four way intersection that is the course that they follow with regard to the body of a wheel turning monarch the course they follow with regard to the body of a wheel turning monarch ananda is the course that should be followed with regard to the body of the tathagata a burial mound for the tathagata is to be built at a great four way intersection and those who offer a garland a scent or a perfume powder there or bow down there or brighten their minds there that will be for their long term welfare happiness and for what reason is a tathagata worthy rightly self awakened worthy of a burial mound at the thought this is the burial mound of a tathagata worthy rightly self awakened many people will brighten their minds having brightened their minds there then on the break up of the body after death they will reappear in a good destination the heavenly world it is for this reason that a tathagata worthy rightly self awakened is worthy of a burial mound and for what reason is a private buddha worthy of a burial mound at the thought this is the burial mound of a private buddha many people will brighten their minds having brightened their minds there then on the break up of the body after death they will reappear in a good destination the heavenly world and for what reason is a disciple of a tathagata worthy of a burial mound at the thought this is the burial mound of a disciple of a tathagata many people will brighten their minds having brightened their minds there then on the break up of the body after death they will reappear in a good destination the heavenly world and for what reason is a wheel turning monarch worthy of a burial mound at the thought this is the burial mound of a wheel turning monarch many people will brighten their minds having brightened their minds there then on the break up of the body after death they will reappear in a good destination the heavenly world it is for this reason that a wheel turning monarch is worthy of a burial mound these are the four who are worthy of a burial mound then ven ananda going into a nearby building stood leaning against the door jamb weeping here i am still in training with work left to do and the total unbinding of my teacher is about to occur the teacher who has had such sympathy for me then the blessed one said to the monks monks where is ananda lord ven ananda having gone into that building stands leaning against the door jamb weeping here i am still in training with work left to do and the total unbinding of my teacher is about to occur the teacher who has had such sympathy for me then the blessed one told a certain monk come monk in my name call ananda saying the teacher calls you my friend as you say lord the monk answered and having gone to ven ananda on arrival he said the teacher calls you my friend as you say my friend ven ananda replied then he went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him enough ananda don t grieve don t lament haven t i already taught you the state of growing different with regard to all things dear appealing the state of becoming separate the state of becoming otherwise what else is there to expect it s impossible that one could forbid anything born existent fabricated subject to disintegration from disintegrating for a long time ananda you have waited on the tathagata with physical acts of good will helpful happy whole hearted without limit with verbal acts of good will with mental acts of good will helpful happy whole hearted without limit you are one who has made merit commit yourself to exertion and soon you will be without mental fermentations then the blessed one addressed the monks monks those who in the past were worthy ones rightly self awakened had foremost attendants just as i have had ananda those who in the future will be worthy ones rightly self awakened will have foremost attendants just as i have had ananda ananda is wise he knows this is the time to approach to see the tathagata this is the time for monks this the time for nuns this the time for male lay followers this the time for female lay followers this the time for kings their ministers this the time for sectarians this the time for the followers of sectarians when this was said ven ananda said to the blessed one lord may the blessed one not be totally unbound in this little town this dusty town this branch township there are other great cities don t say that ananda don t say that this little town this dusty town this branch township in the past ananda a king named now ananda go into kusinara and announce to the kusinara mallans tonight vasitthas in the last watch of the night the total unbinding of the tathagata will occur come out vasitthas come out vasitthas don t later regret that the tathagata s total unbinding occurred within the borders of our very own town but we didn t get to see him in his final hour responding as you say lord ven ananda put on his robe and carrying his bowl outer robe went unaccompanied into kusinara then the mallans together with their sons daughters wives shocked saddened their minds overflowing with sorrow went to ven ananda at upavattana the mallans sal grove near kusinara the thought occurred to ven ananda if i let the mallans pay reverence to the blessed one one by one the night will be over before they have finished paying reverence what if i were to have them pay reverence to the blessed one arranging them family by family announcing lord the mallan named so so together with his children wives servants retainers bows down with his head at the blessed one s feet in this way ven ananda got the mallans to pay reverence to the blessed one within the first watch of the night now at that time so he went to upavattana the mallans sal grove and on arrival said to ven ananda i have heard the elder wanderers teachers of teachers saying that only once in a long long time do tathagatas worthy ones rightly self awakened appear in the world tonight in the last watch of the night the total unbinding of gotama the contemplative will occur now there is a doubt that has arisen in me but i have faith that he could teach me the dhamma in such a way that i might abandon that doubt it would be good ven ananda if you would let me see him when this was said ven ananda said to him enough friend subhadda don t bother the blessed one the blessed one is tired for a second time for a third time subhadda the wanderer said to ven ananda it would be good ven ananda if you would let me see him for a third time ven ananda said to him enough friend subhadda don t bother the blessed one the blessed one is tired now the blessed one heard the exchange between ven ananda subhadda the wanderer and so he said to ven ananda enough ananda don t stand in his way let him see the tathagata whatever he asks me will all be for the sake of knowledge and not to be bothersome and whatever i answer when asked he will quickly understand so ven ananda said to subhadda the wanderer go ahead friend subhadda the blessed one gives you his leave enough subhadda put this question aside i will teach you the dhamma listen and pay close attention i will speak at age twenty nine i went forth seeking what might be skillful and since my going forth more than fifty years have passed outside of the realm of methodical dhamma there is no contemplative and no contemplative of the second third fourth order other teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplatives and if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of arahants then subhadda the wanderer said anyone subhadda who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires the going forth admission in this doctrine discipline must first undergo probation for four months if at the end of four months the monks feel so moved they give him the going forth admit him to the monk s state but i know distinctions among individuals in this matter lord if that is so i am willing to undergo probation for four years if at the end of four years the monks feel so moved let them give me the going forth admit me to the monk s state yes lord ananda answered then subhadda said to ven ananda it is a gain for you ananda a great gain that you have been anointed here in the teacher s presence with the pupil s anointing at present the monks address one another as friend but after i am gone they are not to address one another that way the more senior monks are to address the newer monks by their name or clan or as friend the newer monks are to address the more senior monks as venerable or sir after i am gone the sangha if it wants may abolish the lesser minor training rules after i am gone the monk what lord is the brahma penalty channa may say what he wants ananda but he is not to be spoken to instructed or admonished by the monks then the blessed one addressed the monks if even a single monk has any doubt or perplexity concerning the buddha dhamma or sangha the path or the practice ask don t later regret that the teacher was face to face with us but we didn t bring ourselves to cross question him in his presence when this was said the monks were silent a second time the blessed one said if even a single monk has any doubt or perplexity concerning the buddha dhamma or sangha the path or the practice ask don t later regret that the teacher was face to face with us but we didn t bring ourselves to cross question him in his presence a second time the monks were silent a third time the blessed one said if even a single monk has any doubt or perplexity concerning the buddha dhamma or sangha the path or the practice ask don t later regret that the teacher was face to face with us but we didn t bring ourselves to cross question him in his presence a third time the monks were silent then the blessed one addressed the monks now if it s out of respect for the teacher that you don t ask let a friend inform a friend when this was said the monks were silent then ven ananda said to the blessed one it s amazing lord it s marvelous i m confident that in this community of monks there is not even a single monk who has any doubt or perplexity concerning the buddha dhamma or sangha the path or the practice you ananda speak out of confidence while there is knowledge in the tathagata that in this community of monks there is not even a single monk who has any doubt or perplexity concerning the buddha dhamma or sangha the path or the practice of these monks the most backward is a stream winner not destined for the planes of deprivation headed to self awakening for sure then the blessed one entered the first jhana emerging from that he entered the second jhana emerging from that he entered the third the fourth jhana the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor non perception emerging from that he entered the cessation of perception feeling then ven ananda said to no friend ananda the blessed one isn t totally unbound he has entered the cessation of perception feeling then the blessed one emerging from the cessation of perception feeling entered the dimension of neither perception nor non perception emerging from that he entered the dimension of nothingness the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of the infinitude of space the fourth jhana the third the second the first jhana emerging from the first jhana he entered the second the third the fourth jhana emerging from the fourth jhana he immediately was totally unbound when the blessed one was totally unbound simultaneously with the total unbinding there was a great earthquake awesome hair raising and the drums of the devas sounded when the blessed one was totally unbound simultaneously with the total unbinding all beings all in the world will cast off the bodily heap in the world where a teacher like this without peer in the world the tathagata with strength attained the rightly self awakened one has been totally unbound when the blessed one was totally unbound simultaneously with the total unbinding how inconstant are compounded things their nature to arise pass away they disband as they are arising their total stilling is bliss when the blessed one was totally unbound simultaneously with the total unbinding ven anuruddha uttered this verse he had no in out breathing the one who was such the firm minded one imperturbable bent on peace the sage completing his span with heart unbowed he endured the pain like a flame s unbinding was the liberation of awareness when the blessed one was totally unbound simultaneously with the total unbinding ven ananda uttered this verse it was awe inspiring it was hair raising when displaying the foremost accomplishment in all things the rightly self awakened one was totally unbound when the blessed one was totally unbound simultaneously with the total unbinding some of the monks present who were not without passion wept uplifting their arms as if their feet were cut out from under them they fell down and rolled back forth crying all too soon is the blessed one totally unbound all too soon is the one well gone totally unbound all too soon the one with eyes has disappeared from the world but those monks who were free from passion acquiesced mindful alert fabrications are inconstant what else is there to expect then ven anuruddha addressed the monks enough friends don t grieve don t lament hasn t the blessed one already taught the state of growing different with regard to all things dear appealing the state of becoming separate the state of becoming otherwise what else is there to expect it s impossible that one could forbid anything born existent fabricated subject to disintegration from disintegrating the devatas friends are complaining ananda but ven anuruddha what is the state of the devatas the blessed one is referring to friend ananda there are devatas who perceive space to be earth tearing at their hair they are weeping uplifting their arms they are weeping as if their feet were cut out from under them they fall down and roll back forth crying all too soon is the blessed one totally unbound all too soon is the one well gone totally unbound all too soon the one with eyes has disappeared from the world then there are devatas who perceive earth to be earth tearing at their hair they are weeping uplifting their arms they are weeping as if their feet were cut out from under them they fall down and roll back forth crying all too soon is the blessed one totally unbound all too soon is the one well gone totally unbound all too soon the one with eyes has disappeared from the world but those devatas who are free from passion acquiesce mindful alert fabrications are inconstant what else is there to expect then ven anuruddha ven ananda spent the remainder of the night in dhamma talk then ven anuruddha said to ven ananda go friend ananda entering kusinara announce to the kusinara mallans the blessed one vasitthas is totally unbound now is the time for you to do as you see fit responding as you say sir ven ananda in the early morning put on his robe and carrying his bowl outer robe went unaccompanied into kusinara now at that time the kusinara mallans had met for some business in their assembly hall ven ananda went to the assembly hall and on arrival announced to them the blessed one vasitthas is totally unbound now is the time for you to do as you see fit when they heard ven ananda the mallans together with their sons daughters wives were shocked saddened their minds overflowing with sorrow some of them wept tearing at their hair they wept uplifting their arms as if their feet were cut out from under them they fell down and rolled back forth crying all too soon is the blessed one totally unbound all too soon is the one well gone totally unbound all too soon the one with eyes has disappeared from the world then the kusinara mallans ordered their men in that case i say gather scents garlands all the musical instruments in kusinara then taking scents garlands all the musical instruments in kusinara along with lengths of cloth the kusinara mallans went to the blessed one s body in upavattana the mallans sal grove near kusinara on arrival they spent the entire day in worshipping honoring respecting venerating the blessed one s body with dances songs music garlands scents in making cloth canopies and arranging floral wreaths then the thought occurred to them it s too late today to cremate the blessed one s body we ll cremate the blessed one s body tomorrow and so they spent the second day the third day the fourth day the fifth day the sixth day in worshipping honoring respecting venerating the blessed one s body with dances songs music garlands scents in making cloth canopies and arranging floral wreaths then on the seventh day the thought occurred to them worshipping honoring respecting venerating to the blessed one s body with dances songs music garlands scents let s carry it to the south around the outside of the town and cremate it to the south of the town then eight leading mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking we ll lift up the blessed one s body were unable to lift it so the kusinara mallans asked ven anuruddha what is the reason ven anuruddha what is the cause why these eight leading mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking we ll lift up the blessed one s body are unable to lift it your intention vasitthas is one thing the devas intention is another but what ven anuruddha is the devas intention your intention vasitthas is worshipping honoring respecting venerating the blessed one s body with dances songs music garlands scents let s carry it to the south around the outside of the town and cremate it to the south of the town the devas intention is worshipping honoring respecting venerating the blessed one s body with heavenly dances songs music garlands scents let s carry it to the north of the town enter the town through the north gate carry it through the middle of the town and out the east gate to the mallans memorial called then let it be venerable sir in line with the devas intention now at that time kusinara even to its rubbish heaps cesspools was strewn knee deep in coral tree flowers so the devas the kusinara mallans worshipping honoring respecting venerating the blessed one s body with heavenly human dances songs music garlands scents carried it to the north of the town entered the town through the north gate carried it through the middle of the town and out the east gate to the mallans memorial called makuta bandhana there they set it down then the kusinara mallans said to ven ananda venerable sir what course should we follow with regard to the tathagata s body the course they follow with regard to the body of a wheel turning monarch vasitthas is the course that should be followed with regard to the body of the tathagata and what venerable sir is the course they follow with regard to the body of a wheel turning monarch vasitthas they wrap the body of a wheel turning monarch in new linen cloth having wrapped it in new linen cloth they wrap it in teased cotton wool having wrapped it in teased cotton wool they wrap it in new linen cloth having done this times they place the body in an iron oil vat cover it with an iron lid make a pyre composed totally of perfumed substances and cremate the body then they build a burial mound for the wheel turning monarch at a great four way intersection that is the course that they follow with regard to the body of a wheel turning monarch the course they follow with regard to the body of a wheel turning monarch vasitthas is the course that should be followed with regard to the body of the tathagata a burial mound for the tathagata is to be built at a great four way intersection and those who offer a garland a scent or a perfume powder there or bow down there or brighten their minds there that will be for their long term welfare happiness so the kusinara mallans ordered their men in that case i say gather the mallans teased cotton wool then they wrapped the blessed one s body in new linen cloth having wrapped it in new linen cloth they wrapped it in teased cotton wool having wrapped it in teased cotton wool they wrapped it in new linen cloth having done this times they placed the body in an iron oil vat covered it with an iron lid made a pyre composed totally of perfumed substances and set the body on the pyre now at that time yes friend i know him seven days ago gotama the contemplative was totally unbound that s how i got this coral tree flower with that some of the monks present who were not without passion wept uplifting their arms as if their feet were cut out from under them they fell down and rolled back forth crying all too soon is the blessed one totally unbound all too soon is the one well gone totally unbound all too soon the one with eyes has disappeared from the world but those monks who were free from passion acquiesced mindful alert fabrications are inconstant what else is there to expect now at that time a monk named then ven maha kassapa addressed the monks enough friends don t grieve don t lament hasn t the blessed one already taught the state of growing different with regard to all things dear appealing the state of becoming separate the state of becoming otherwise what else is there to expect it s impossible that one could forbid anything born existent fabricated subject to disintegration from disintegrating then four leading mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking we ll ignite the blessed one s pyre were unable to ignite it so the kusinara mallans asked ven anuruddha what is the reason ven anuruddha what is the cause why these four leading mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking we ll ignite the blessed one s pyre are unable to ignite it your intention vasitthas is one thing the devas intention is another but what ven anuruddha is the devas intention the devas intention vasitthas is this ven maha kassapa is traveling on the highway from pava to kusinara with a large community of monks approximately monks in all the blessed one s pyre will not catch fire until ven maha kassapa has worshipped the blessed one s feet with his head then let it be venerable sir in line with the devas intention when the blessed one s body was consumed a cascade of water fell from the sky extinguishing the blessed one s pyre water shot up from a sal tree as well extinguishing the blessed one s pyre the kusinara mallans with all kinds of scented water extinguished the blessed one s pyre then for seven days they kept the bone relics in their assembly hall setting them round with a lattice of spears surrounded by ramparts of bows worshipping honoring respecting venerating them with dances songs music garlands scents then the the the the brahman of the pava mallans heard the blessed one they say has been totally unbound in kusinara so they sent an envoy to the kusinara mallans the blessed one was a noble warrior we too are noble warriors we deserve a share of the blessed one s bone relics we too will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for them when this was said the kusinara mallans said to the groups factions the blessed one was totally unbound within the borders of our own town we will not give up a share of the blessed one s bone relics when this was said listen good sirs to a word from me our awakened one taught forbearance it s not good that there should be combat over the relics of the highest one let s unite in concord on friendly terms and make eight shares let there be burial mounds in the various directions many people made confident in the one with eyes in that case brahman you yourself divide the blessed one s bone relics into eight equal shares responding as you say good sirs to the groups factions dona the brahman divided the blessed one s bone relics into eight equal shares and then said to the groups factions good sirs give me this urn i will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for the urn they gave him the urn then the there is no remaining share of the blessed one s bone relics they have been divided take the embers from here they took the embers from there then king ajatasattu vedehiputta of magadha built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the blessed one s relics in rajagaha the licchavis of vesali built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the blessed one s relics in vesali the sakyans of kapilavattu built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the blessed one s relics in kapilavattu the buliyans of allakappa built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the blessed one s relics in allakappa the koliyans of ramagama built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the blessed one s relics in ramagama the brahman of vettha island built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the blessed one s relics on vettha island the pava mallans built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the blessed one s relics in pava the kusinara mallans built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the blessed one s relics in kusinara dona the brahman built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the urn the moriyans of pipphalivana built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the embers in pipphalivana thus there were eight burial mounds for the bone relics a ninth for the urn and a tenth for the embers that is how it was in the past eight portions were the relics of the one with vision the highest the foremost of men seven honored in jambudipa and one in ramagama honored by kings of the nagas one tooth the devas of the thirty three worship one is honored in gandharapura one in the realm of the king of kalinga another is honored by kings of the nagas these with their splendor their excellent gifts embellish this wealth bearing earth thus the relics of the one with vision are honored by those honored by those who are honored he is worshiped by deva kings naga kings human kings and likewise is worshiped by the most excellent people so pay homage to him with hands palm to palm over the heart for the awakened are rarely encountered in the course of one hundred eons then ven upali went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one it would be good lord if the blessed one would teach me the dhamma in brief such that having heard the dhamma from the blessed one i might dwell alone secluded heedful ardent resolute upali the qualities of which you may know these qualities do not lead to utter disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to self awakening nor to unbinding you may categorically hold this is not the dhamma this is not the vinaya this is not the teacher s instruction as for the qualities of which you may know these qualities lead to utter disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to self awakening to unbinding you may categorically hold this is the dhamma this is the vinaya this is the teacher s instruction monks this recitation of more than training rules comes every fortnight in reference to which sons of good families desiring the goal train themselves there is the case where a monk is wholly accomplished in virtue moderately accomplished in concentration and moderately accomplished in discernment with reference to the lesser and minor training rules he falls into offenses and rehabilitates himself why is that because i have not declared that to be a disqualification in these circumstances but as for the training rules that are basic to the holy life and proper to the holy life he is one of permanent virtue one of steadfast virtue having undertaken them he trains in reference to the training rules with the wasting away of the first three fetters he is a stream winner never again destined for states of woe certain headed for self awakening there is the case where a monk is wholly accomplished in virtue moderately accomplished in concentration and moderately accomplished in discernment with reference to the lesser and minor training rules he falls into offenses and rehabilitates himself why is that because i have not declared that to be a disqualification in these circumstances but as for the training rules that are basic to the holy life and proper to the holy life he is one of permanent virtue one of steadfast virtue having undertaken them he trains in reference to the training rules with the wasting away of the first three fetters and with the attenuation of passion aversion delusion he is a once returner who on returning only once more to this world will put an end to stress there is the case where a monk is wholly accomplished in virtue wholly accomplished in concentration and moderately accomplished in discernment with reference to the lesser and minor training rules he falls into offenses and rehabilitates himself why is that because i have not declared that to be a disqualification in these circumstances but as for the training rules that are basic to the holy life and proper to the holy life he is one of permanent virtue one of steadfast virtue having undertaken them he trains in reference to the training rules with the wasting away of the five lower fetters he is due to be spontaneously reborn in the pure abodes there to be totally unbound destined never again to return from that world there is the case where a monk is wholly accomplished in virtue wholly accomplished in concentration wholly accomplished in discernment with reference to the lesser and minor training rules he falls into offenses and rehabilitates himself why is that because i have not declared that to be a disqualification in these circumstances but as for the training rules that are basic to the holy life and proper to the holy life he is one of permanent virtue one of steadfast virtue having undertaken them he trains in reference to the training rules with the ending of effluents he dwells in the effluent free awareness release and discernment release having directly known and realized them for himself right in the here and now those who are partially accomplished attain a part those who are wholly accomplished the whole the training rules i tell you are not in vain i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near so the brahmans went to the brahman student assalayana and said to him master assalayana this gotama the contemplative prescribes purity for the four castes come and dispute with him on this statement when this was said the brahman student assalayana said to the brahmans sirs gotama the contemplative is one who speaks dhamma and those who speak dhamma are hard to dispute with i can t dispute with him on this statement a second time a third time the brahmans said to the brahman student assalayana master assalayana this gotama the contemplative prescribes purity for the four castes come and dispute with him on this statement for you have lived the life of a wanderer don t be defeated without being defeated in battle when this was said the brahman student assalayana said to the brahmans apparently sirs i don t get leave from you to avoid the matter by saying gotama the contemplative is one who speaks dhamma and those who speak dhamma are hard to dispute with i can t dispute with him on this statement but at your bidding i will go then the brahman student assalayana went with a large group of brahmans to the blessed one and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one master gotama the brahmans say brahmans are the superior caste any other caste is inferior only brahmans are the fair caste any other caste is dark only brahmans are pure not non brahmans only brahmans are the sons offspring of brahma born of his mouth born of brahma created by brahma heirs of brahma what does master gotama have to say with regard to that but assalayana the brahmans brahman women are plainly seen having their periods becoming pregnant giving birth and nursing their children and yet the brahmans being born through the birth canal say brahmans are the superior caste any other caste is inferior only brahmans are the fair caste any other caste is dark only brahmans are pure not non brahmans only brahmans are the sons offspring of brahma born of his mouth born of brahma created by brahma heirs of brahma even though master gotama says that still the brahmans think brahmans are the superior caste the sons offspring of brahma born of his mouth born of brahma created by brahma heirs of brahma what do you think assalayana have you heard that in yana kamboja and other outlying countries there are only two castes masters slaves and that having been a master one can become a slave and that having been a slave one can become a master yes master gotama so what strength is there assalayana what assurance when the brahmans say brahmans are the superior caste the sons offspring of brahma born of his mouth born of brahma created by brahma heirs of brahma even though master gotama says that still the brahmans think brahmans are the superior caste the sons offspring of brahma born of his mouth born of brahma created by brahma heirs of brahma what do you think assalayana is it only a noble warrior who taking life stealing engaging in sexual misconduct telling lies speaking divisively speaking harshly engaging in idle chatter greedy bearing thoughts of ill will and holding wrong views on the break up of the body after death reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell and not a brahman is it only a merchant is it only a worker who taking life stealing engaging in sexual misconduct telling lies speaking divisively speaking harshly engaging in idle chatter greedy bearing thoughts of ill will and holding wrong views on the break up of the body after death reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell and not a brahman no master gotama even a noble warrior even a brahman even a merchant even a worker members of all four castes if they take life steal engage in sexual misconduct tell lies speak divisively speak harshly engage in idle chatter are greedy bear thoughts of ill will hold wrong views on the break up of the body after death reappear in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell so what strength is there assalayana what assurance when the brahmans say brahmans are the superior caste the sons offspring of brahma born of his mouth born of brahma created by brahma heirs of brahma even though master gotama says that still the brahmans think brahmans are the superior caste the sons offspring of brahma born of his mouth born of brahma created by brahma heirs of brahma what do you think assalayana is it only a brahman who refraining from taking life from stealing from sexual misconduct from telling lies from speaking divisive speech from harsh speech from idle chatter not greedy bearing no thoughts of ill will holding to right view on the break up of the body after death reappears in the good destination the heavenly world and not a noble warrior not a merchant not a worker no master gotama even a noble warrior even a

gotama says that still the brahmans think brahmans are the superior caste the sons offspring of brahma born of his mouth born of brahma created by brahma heirs of brahma what do you think assalayana is it only a brahman who is capable of developing in any direction a heart of good will free from animosity free from ill will and not a noble warrior not a merchant not a worker no master gotama even a noble warrior even a brahman even a merchant even a worker members of all four castes are capable of developing in any direction a heart of good will free from animosity free from ill will so what strength is there assalayana what assurance when the brahmans say brahmans are the superior caste the sons offspring of brahma born of his mouth born of brahma created by brahma heirs of brahma even though master gotama says that still the brahmans think brahmans are the superior caste the sons offspring of brahma born of his mouth born of brahma created by brahma heirs of brahma what do you think assalayana is it only a brahman who is capable of taking a loofah bath powder going to a river and scrubbing off dust dirt and not a noble warrior not a merchant not a worker no master gotama even a noble warrior even a brahman even a merchant even a worker members of all four castes are capable of taking a loofah bath powder going to a river and scrubbing off dust dirt so what strength is

offspring of brahma born of his mouth born of brahma created by brahma heirs of brahma what do you think assalayana no master gotama the fire made by those born from a noble warrior clan a brahman clan or a royal clan would have flame color radiance able to do whatever a fire might be needed to do and the fire made by those born from an outcast clan a trapper clan a wicker workers clan a cartwrights clan or a scavengers clan would have flame color radiance able to do whatever a fire might be needed to do for all fire has flame color radiance and is able to do whatever a fire might be needed to do so what strength is there assalayana what assurance when the brahmans say brahmans are the superior caste only brahmans are pure not non brahmans only brahmans are the sons offspring of

brahmans only brahmans are the sons offspring of brahma born of his mouth born of brahma created by brahma heirs of brahma what do you think assalayana there is the case where a noble warrior youth might cohabit with a brahman maiden and from their cohabitation a son would be born would the son born from the noble warrior youth and brahman maiden be like the father and like the mother should it be called a noble warrior a brahman yes master gotama what do you think assalayana there is the case where a brahman youth might cohabit with a noble warrior maiden and from their cohabitation a son would be born would the son born from the brahman youth and noble warrior maiden be like the father and like the mother should it be called a noble warrior a brahman yes master gotama what do you think assalayana there is the case where a mare might mate with a donkey and from their mating a foal would be born would the foal born from the mare the donkey be like the father and like the mother should it be called a horse a donkey master gotama from the mixed breeding it would be a mule here i see that it the mixed breeding makes a difference but there in the other two cases i don t see that it makes a difference what do you think assalayana there is the case where there might be two brahman student brothers born of the same mother one learned initiated the other not learned uninitiated which of the two would the brahmans serve first at a funeral feast a milk rice offering a sacrifice or a feast for guests the brahman student who was learned initiated master gotama for what great fruit would there be for what is given to one who is not learned uninitiated what do you think assalayana there is the case where there might be two brahman student brothers born of the same mother one learned initiated but unvirtuous of evil character the other not learned uninitiated but virtuous of fine character which of the two would the brahmans serve first at a funeral feast a milk rice offering a sacrifice or a feast for guests the brahman student who was not learned uninitiated but virtuous of fine character master gotama for what great fruit would there be for what is given to one who is unvirtuous of evil character first assalayana you went by birth then having gone by birth you went by mantras then having gone by mantras putting them both aside you have come around to the purity of the four castes that i prescribe when this was said the brahman student assalayana sat silent abashed his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for words then the blessed one seeing that the brahman student assalayana was sitting silent abashed his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for words said to him once assalayana this evil viewpoint arose in the seven brahman seers as they were consulting together in leaf huts in the wilderness brahmans are the superior caste any other caste is inferior only brahmans are the fair caste any other caste is dark only brahmans are pure not non brahmans only brahmans are the sons offspring of brahma born of his mouth born of brahma created by brahma heirs of brahma then the seer then the seven brahman seers said to the seer devala the dark now who is this walking back forth in the courtyard of the seven brahman seers like a village lout saying well now where have these masters the brahman seers gone well now where have these masters the brahman seers gone let s curse him so the seven brahman seers cursed the seer devala the dark be ashes dribble spit masters your asceticism is not in vain and your holy life not fruitless please masters abandon your hatred toward me we abandon our hatred toward you master who are you have you heard of the seer devala the dark yes master i am he then the seven brahman seers approached him to bow down to him and he said to them i have heard that this evil viewpoint has arisen in the seven brahman seers as they are consulting together in leaf huts in the wilderness brahmans are the superior caste any other caste is inferior only brahmans are the sons offspring of brahma born of his mouth born of brahma created by brahma heirs of brahma that is so master but do you know masters if the mother who bore you went only with a brahman and not with a non brahman no master and do you know if the mothers of the mother who bore you back seven generations of mothers went only with brahmans and not with non brahmans no master and do you know if the father who sired you went only with a brahman woman and not with a non brahman woman no master and do you know if the fathers of the father who bore you back seven generations of fathers went only with brahman women and not with non brahman women no master do you know how there is the descent of an embryo yes master we know how there is the descent of an embryo there is the case where the mother father have come together the mother is fertile and a but do you know for sure whether the gandhabba is a noble warrior a brahman a merchant or a worker no master that being the case do you know who you are that being the case master we don t know who we are now assalayana when those seven brahman seers couldn t defend their own birth statement when interrogated pressed rebuked by the seer devala the dark how can you now defend your own birth statement when interrogated pressed rebuked by me you their lineage holder but not the equal of punna their ladle holder when this was said the brahman student assalayana said to the blessed one at he assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or feeling as in the self or the self as in feeling he assumes perception to be the self or the self as possessing perception or perception as in the self or the self as in perception he assumes mental fabrications to be the self or the self as possessing fabrications or fabrications as in the self or the self as in fabrications he assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness thus both this assumption the understanding i am occur to him and so it is with reference to the understanding i am that there is the appearance of the five faculties eye ear nose tongue body the senses of vision hearing smell taste touch now there is the intellect there are ideas mental qualities there is the property of ignorance to an uninstructed run of the mill person touched by experience born of the contact of ignorance there occur the thoughts i am i am thus i shall be i shall not be i shall be possessed of form i shall be formless i shall be percipient conscious i shall be non percipient or i shall be neither percipient nor non percipient the five faculties monks continue as they were and with regard to them the well instructed disciple of the noble ones abandons ignorance and gives rise to clear knowing owing to the fading of ignorance and the arising of clear knowing the thoughts i am i am this i shall be i shall not be i shall be possessed of form i shall be formless i shall be percipient conscious i shall be non percipient and i shall be neither percipient nor non percipient do not occur to him at even though this wish may occur to a monk who dwells without devoting himself to development o that my mind might be released from effluents through lack of clinging still his mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clinging why is that from lack of developing it should be said lack of developing what the four frames of reference the four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for awakening the noble eightfold path even though this wish may not occur to a monk who dwells devoting himself to development o that my mind might be released from effluents through lack of clinging still his mind is released from the effluents through lack of clinging why is that from developing it should be said developing what the four frames of reference the four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for awakening the noble eightfold path suppose a hen has eight ten or twelve eggs that she covers rightly warms rightly incubates rightly even though this wish may not occur to her o that my chicks might break through the egg shells with their spiked claws or beaks and hatch out safely still it is possible that the chicks will break through the egg shells with their spiked claws or beaks and hatch out safely why is that because the hen has covered them warmed them incubated them rightly in the same way even though this wish may not occur to a monk who dwells devoting himself to development o that my mind might be released from effluents through lack of clinging still his mind is released from the effluents through lack of clinging why is that from developing it should be said developing what the four frames of reference the four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for awakening the noble eightfold path monks these five future dangers are just enough when considered for a monk living in the wilderness heedful ardent and resolute to live for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized which five there is the case where a monk living in the wilderness reminds himself of this i am now living alone in the wilderness while i am living alone in the wilderness a snake might bite me a scorpion might sting me a centipede might bite me that would be how my death would come about that would be an obstruction for me so let me make an effort for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized this is the first future danger that is just enough when considered for a monk living in the wilderness heedful ardent and resolute to live for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized furthermore the monk living in the wilderness reminds himself of this i am now living alone in the wilderness while i am living alone in the wilderness stumbling i might fall my food digested might trouble me my bile might be provoked my phlegm piercing wind forces in the body might be provoked that would be how my death would come about that would be an obstruction for me so let me make an effort for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized this is the second future danger that is just enough when considered for a monk living in the wilderness heedful ardent and resolute to live for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized furthermore the monk living in the wilderness reminds himself of this i am now living alone in the wilderness while i am living alone in the wilderness i might meet up with vicious beasts a lion or a tiger or a leopard or a bear or a hyena they might take my life that would be how my death would come about that would be an obstruction for me so let me make an effort for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized this is the third future danger that is just enough when considered for a monk living in the wilderness heedful ardent and resolute to live for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized furthermore the monk living in the wilderness reminds himself of this i am now living alone in the wilderness while i am living alone in the wilderness i might meet up with youths on their way to committing a crime or on their way back they might take my life that would be how my death would come about that would be an obstruction for me so let me make an effort for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized this is the fourth future danger that is just enough when considered for a monk living in the wilderness heedful ardent and resolute to live for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized furthermore the monk living in the wilderness reminds himself of this i am now living alone in the wilderness and in the wilderness are vicious non human beings spirits they might take my life that would be how my death would come about that would be an obstruction for me so let me make an effort for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized this is the fifth future danger that is just enough when considered for a monk living in the wilderness heedful ardent and resolute to live for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized these are the five future dangers that are just enough when considered for a monk living in the wilderness heedful ardent and resolute to live for the attaining of the as yet unattained the reaching of the as yet unreached the realization of the as yet unrealized what should be done by one skillful in good so as to gain the state of peace is this let him be able and upright and straight easy to speak to gentle and not proud contented too supported easily with few tasks and living very lightly his faculties serene prudent and modest unswayed by the emotions of the clans and let him never do the slightest thing that other wise men might hold blamable and let him think in safety and in bliss may creatures all be of a blissful heart whatever breathing beings there may be no matter whether they are frail or firm with none excepted be they long or big or middle sized or be they short or small or thick as well as those seen or unseen or whether they are dwelling far or near existing or yet seeking to exist may creatures all be of a blissful heart let no one work another one s undoing or even slight him at all anywhere and never let them wish each other ill through provocation or resentful thought and just as might a mother with her life protect the son that was her only child so let him then for every living thing maintain unbounded consciousness in being and let him too with love for all the world maintain unbounded consciousness in being above below and all round in between untroubled with no enemy or foe and while he stands or walks or while he sits or while he lies down free from drowsiness let him resolve upon this mindfulness this is divine abiding here they say but when he has no trafficking with views is virtuous and has perfected seeing and purges greed for sensual desires he surely comes no more to any womb for us lord all things have the blessed one as their root their guide their refuge it would be well lord if the meaning of these words were to be made clear by the blessed one there is such a criterion monks whereby a monk could affirm the attainment of enlightenment what is that method in this monks a monk seeing an object with the eye recognizes within himself the presence of lust hatred or delusion knowing lust hatred or delusion is present in me or he recognizes the absence of these things knowing there is no lust hatred or delusion present in me now monks as regards that recognition of the presence or absence of these things within him are these matters to be perceived by faith by persuasion by inclination by rational speculation by delight in views and theories no indeed lord are not these matters to be perceived by the eye of wisdom indeed lord then monks this is the criterion whereby a monk apart from faith apart from persuasion apart from inclination apart from rational speculation apart from delight in views and theories could affirm the attainment of enlightenment birth is destroyed the holy life has been accomplished what was to be done is done there is no further living in this world life personhood pleasure and pain this is all that s bound together in a single mental event a moment that quickly takes place even the spirits who endure for eighty four thousand aeons even these do not live the same for any two moments of mind what ceases for one who is dead or for one who s still standing here are all just the same aggregates gone never to connect again the states which are vanishing now and those which will vanish some day have characteristics no different than those which have vanished before with no production there s no birth with becoming present one lives when grasped with the highest meaning the world is dead when the mind stops there s no hoarding what has vanished no piling up for the future those who have been born are standing like a seed upon a needle the vanishing of all these states that have become is not welcome though dissolving phenomena stand uncombined from primordial time from the unseen states come and go glimpsed only as they re passing by like lightning flashing in the sky they arise and then pass away whatever is not yours let go of it your letting go of it will be for your long term happiness benefit and what is not yours the eye is not yours let go of it your letting go of it will be for your long term happiness benefit forms are not yours eye consciousness is not yours eye contact is not yours whatever arises in dependence on eye contact experienced either as pleasure as pain or as neither pleasure nor pain that too is not yours let go of

your long term happiness benefit no lord why is that because those things are not our self nor do they pertain to our self in the same way monks the eye is not yours let go of it your letting go of it will be for your long term happiness benefit the ear the nose the tongue the body the intellect is not yours let go of it your letting go of it will be for your long term happiness benefit whatever arises in dependence on intellect contact experienced either as pleasure as pain or as neither pleasure nor pain that too is not yours let go of it your letting go of it will be for your long term happiness benefit on one occasion the blessed one was staying near savatthi in jeta s grove anathapindika s monastery and at that time ven khema and ven sumana were staying near savatthi in the blind man s grove then ven khema and ven sumana went to the blessed one and on arrival have bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there ven khema said to the blessed one when a monk is an arahant with his fermentations ended one who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and is released through right gnosis the thought doesn t occur to him that there is someone better than me or there is someone equal to me or there is someone worse than me that is what ven khema said and the teacher approved sensing that the teacher approves of me ven khema got up from his seat bowed down to the blessed one circled him keeping him on his right and left then ven sumana not long after ven khema had left said to the blessed one when a monk is an arahant with his fermentations ended one who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and is released through right gnosis the thought doesn t occur to him that there is no one better than me or there is no one equal to me or there is no one worse than me that is what ven sumana said and the teacher approved sensing that the teacher approves of me ven sumana got up from his seat bowed down to the blessed one circled him keeping him on his right and left then the blessed one not long after ven khema ven sumana had left said to the monks monks this is how clansmen declare gnosis the meaning of gnosis is stated but without mention of self yet there are some worthless people who declare gnosis as if in jest they will fall into trouble afterward not as higher lower nor equal do they refer to themselves with birth ended the holy life fulfilled they go about totally freed from fetters at savatthi there are o monks four nutriments edible food coarse and fine how o monks should the nutriment edible food be considered suppose a couple husband and wife have set out on a journey through the desert carrying only limited provisions they have with them their only son dearly beloved by them now while these two traveled through the desert their limited stock of provisions ran out and came to an end but there was still a stretch of desert not yet crossed then the two thought our small stock of provisions has run out it has come to an end and there is still a stretch of desert that is not yet crossed should we not kill our only son so dearly beloved prepare dried and roasted meat and eating our son s flesh we may cross in that way the remaining part of the desert lest all three of us perish and these two husband and wife killed their only son so dearly beloved by them prepared dried and roasted meat and eating their son s flesh crossed in that way the remaining part of the desert and while eating their son s flesh they were beating their breast and crying where are you our only and beloved son where are you our only and beloved son what do you think o monks will they eat the food for the pleasure of it for enjoyment for comeliness sake for the body s embellishment certainly not o lord will they not rather eat the food merely for the sake of crossing the desert so it is o lord in the same manner i say o monks should edible food be considered if o monks the nutriment edible food is comprehended the lust for the five sense objects is thereby comprehended and if lust for the five sense objects is comprehended there is no fetter enchained by which a noble disciple might come to this world again and how o monks should the nutriment sense impression be considered suppose o monks there is a skinned cow that stands close to a wall then the creatures living in the wall will nibble at the cow and if the skinned cow stands near a tree then the creatures living in the tree will nibble at it if it stands in the water the creatures living in the water will nibble at it if it stands in the open air the creatures living in the air will nibble at it wherever that skinned cow stands the creatures living there will nibble at it in that manner i say o monks should the nutriment sense impression be considered if the nutriment sense impression is comprehended the three kinds of feeling and how o monks should the nutriment volitional thought be considered suppose o monks there is a pit of glowing embers filled to cover a man s height with embers glowing without flames and smoke now a man comes that way who loves life and does not wish to die who wishes for happiness and detests suffering then two strong men would seize both his arms and drag him to the pit of glowing embers then o monks far away from it would recoil that man s will far away from it his longing far away his inclination and why because the man knows if i fall into that pit of glowing embers i shall meet death or deadly pain in that manner i say o monks should the nutriment volitional thought be considered if the nutriment volitional thought is comprehended the three kinds of craving and how o monks should the nutriment consciousness be considered suppose o monks people have seized a criminal a robber and brought him before the king saying this is a criminal a robber o majesty mete out to him the punishment you think fit then the king would tell them go and in the morning strike this man with a hundred spears and they strike him in the morning with a hundred spears at noon the king would ask his men how is that man he is still alive your majesty then go and strike him again at noontime with a hundred spears so they did and in the evening the king asks them again how is that man he is still alive then go and in the evening strike him again with a hundred spears and so they did what do you think o monks will that man struck with three hundred spears during a day suffer pain and torment owing to that even if he were to be struck only by a single spear he would suffer pain and torment owing to that how much more if he is being struck by three hundred spears in that manner i say o monks should the nutriment consciousness be considered if the nutriment consciousness is comprehended mind and matter are thereby comprehended and if mind and body are comprehended there is i say no further work left to do for the noble disciple at savatthi then early in the morning sela the nun put on her robes and taking her bowl outer robe went into savatthi for alms when she had gone for alms in savatthi and had returned from her alms round after her meal she went to the grove of the blind to spend the day having gone deep into the grove of the blind she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day s abiding then mara the evil one wanting to arouse fear horripilation terror in her wanting to make her fall away from concentration approached her addressed her in verse by whom was this doll created where is the doll s maker where has the doll originated where does it cease then the thought occurred to sela the nun now who has recited this verse a human being or a non human one then it occurred to her this is mara the evil one who has recited this verse wanting to arouse fear horripilation terror in me wanting to make me fall away from concentration then having understood that this is mara the evil one she replied to him in verses this doll isn t self made nor is this misery made by another then mara the evil one sad dejected at realizing sela the nun knows me vanished right there i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at yes lord the monks replied the blessed one said when a monk is intent on the heightened mind there are five themes he should attend to at the appropriate times which five there is the case where evil unskillful thoughts imbued with desire aversion or delusion arise in a monk while he is referring to and attending to a particular theme he should attend to another theme apart from that one connected with what is skillful when he is attending to this other theme apart from that one connected with what is skillful then those evil unskillful thoughts imbued with desire aversion or delusion are abandoned and subside with their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it just as a skilled carpenter or his apprentice would use a small peg to knock out drive out and pull out a large one in the same way if evil unskillful thoughts imbued with desire aversion or delusion arise in a monk while he is referring to and attending to a particular theme he should attend to another theme apart from that one connected with what is skillful when he is attending to this other theme apart from that one connected with what is skillful then those evil unskillful thoughts imbued with desire aversion or delusion are abandoned and subside with their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it if evil unskillful thoughts imbued with desire aversion or delusion still arise in the monk while he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts he should pay no mind and pay no attention to those thoughts as he is paying no mind and paying no attention to them those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside with their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it just as a man with good eyes not wanting to see forms that had come into range would close his eyes or look away in the same way if evil unskillful thoughts imbued with desire aversion or delusion still arise in the monk while he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts he should pay no mind and pay no attention to those thoughts as he is paying no mind and paying no attention to them those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside with their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it if evil unskillful thoughts imbued with desire aversion or delusion still arise in the monk while he is paying no mind and paying no attention to those thoughts he should attend to the relaxing of thought fabrication with regard to those thoughts as he is attending to the relaxing of thought fabrication with regard to those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside with their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it just as the thought would occur to a man walking quickly why am i walking quickly why don t i walk slowly so he walks slowly the thought occurs to him why am i walking slowly why don t i stand so he stands the thought occurs to him why am i standing why don t i sit down so he sits down the thought occurs to him why am i sitting why don t i lie down so he lies down in this way giving up the grosser posture he takes up the more refined one in the same way if evil unskillful thoughts imbued with desire aversion or delusion still arise in the monk while he is paying no mind and paying no attention to those thoughts he should attend to the relaxing of thought fabrication with regard to those thoughts as he is attending to the relaxing of thought fabrication with regard to those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside with their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it if evil unskillful thoughts imbued with desire aversion or delusion still arise in the monk while he is attending to the relaxing of thought fabrication with regard to those thoughts then with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth he should beat down constrain and crush his mind with his awareness as with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth he is beating down constraining and crushing his mind with his awareness those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside with their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it just as a strong man seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the shoulders would beat him down constrain and crush him in the same way if evil unskillful thoughts imbued with desire aversion or delusion still arise in the monk while he is attending to the relaxing of thought fabrication with regard to those thoughts then with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth he should beat down constrain and crush his mind with his awareness as with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth he is beating down constraining and crushing his mind with his awareness those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside with their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it now when a monk attending to another theme scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts paying no mind and paying no attention to those thoughts attending to the relaxing of thought fabrication with regard to those thoughts beating down constraining and crushing his mind with his awareness steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it and concentrates it he is then called a monk with mastery over the ways of thought sequences he thinks whatever thought he wants to and doesn t think whatever thought he doesn t he has severed craving thrown off the fetters and through the right penetration of conceit has made an end of suffering and stress that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words monks these six are conditions that are conducive to amiability that engender feelings of endearment engender feelings of respect leading to a sense of fellowship a lack of disputes harmony a state of unity which six there is the case where a monk is set on bodily acts of good will with regard to his fellows in the holy life to their faces behind their backs this is a condition that is conducive to amiability that engenders feelings of endearment engenders feelings of respect leading to a sense of fellowship a lack of disputes harmony a state of unity furthermore the monk is set on verbal acts of good will with regard to his fellows in the holy life to their faces behind their backs this is a condition that is conducive to amiability that engenders feelings of endearment engenders feelings of respect leading to a sense of fellowship a lack of disputes harmony a state of unity furthermore the monk is set on mental acts of good will with regard to his fellows in the holy life to their faces behind their backs this is a condition that is conducive to amiability that engenders feelings of endearment engenders feelings of respect leading to a sense of fellowship a lack of disputes harmony a state of unity furthermore whatever righteous gains the monk may obtain in a righteous way even if only the alms in his bowl he does not consume them alone he consumes them after sharing them in common with his virtuous fellows in the holy life this is a condition that is conducive to amiability that engenders feelings of endearment engenders feelings of respect leading to a sense of fellowship a lack of disputes harmony a state of unity furthermore with reference to the virtues that are untorn unbroken unspotted unsplattered liberating praised by the wise untarnished leading to concentration the monk dwells with his virtue in tune with that of his fellows in the holy life to their faces behind their backs this is a condition that is conducive to amiability that engenders feelings of endearment engenders feelings of respect leading to a sense of fellowship a lack of disputes harmony a state of unity furthermore with reference to views that are noble leading outward that lead those who act in accordance with them to the right ending of suffering stress the monk dwells with his views in tune with those of his fellows in the holy life to their faces behind their backs this is a condition that is conducive to amiability that engenders feelings of endearment engenders feelings of respect leading to a sense of fellowship a lack of disputes harmony a state of unity these are the six conditions that are conducive to amiability that engender feelings of endearment engender feelings of respect leading to a sense of fellowship a lack of disputes harmony a state of unity seeing the dhamma now the venerable vakkali saw the blessed one coming from a distance and tried to get up then the blessed one said to the venerable vakkali enough vakkali do not try to get up are you feeling better vakkali are you bearing up are your pains getting better and not worse are there signs that they are getting better and not worse no lord i do not feel better i am not bearing up i have severe pains and they are getting worse not better there is no sign of improvement only of worsening have you any doubts vakkali have you any cause for regret indeed lord i have many doubts i have much cause for regret have you nothing to reproach yourself about as regards morals no lord i have nothing to reproach myself about as regards morals well then vakkali if you have nothing to reproach yourself about as regards morals you must have some worry or scruple that is troubling you for a long time lord i have wanted to come and set eyes on the blessed one but i had not the strength in this body to come and see the blessed one enough vakkali what is there to see in this vile body he who sees dhamma vakkali sees me he who sees me sees dhamma truly seeing dhamma one sees me seeing me one sees dhamma on one occasion it can doesn t eye consciousness arise in dependence on the eye forms yes friend and if the cause reason for the arising of eye consciousness were to cease totally everywhere totally in every way without remainder would eye consciousness be discerned no friend it s in this way friend that consciousness has been pointed out revealed and announced by the blessed one with these words for this reason consciousness is not self doesn t ear consciousness arise in dependence on the ear sounds doesn t nose consciousness arise in dependence on the nose aromas doesn t tongue consciousness arise in dependence on the tongue flavors doesn t body consciousness arise in dependence on the body tactile sensations doesn t intellect consciousness arise in dependence on the intellect ideas yes friend and if the cause reason for the arising of intellect consciousness were to cease totally everywhere totally in every way without remainder would intellect consciousness be discerned no friend it s in this way friend that consciousness has been pointed out revealed and announced by the blessed one with these words for this reason consciousness is not self in the same way a monk assumes neither a self nor anything pertaining to a self in the six spheres of sensory contact assuming in this way he doesn t cling to anything in the world not clinging he is not agitated unagitated he is totally unbound right within he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world once yes lord well then moggallana whatever perception you have in mind when drowsiness descends on you don t attend to that perception don t pursue it it s possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness but if by doing this you don t shake off your drowsiness then recall to your awareness the dhamma as you have heard memorized it re examine it ponder it over in your mind it s possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness but if by doing this you don t shake off your drowsiness then repeat aloud in detail the dhamma as you have heard memorized it it s possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness but if by doing this you don t shake off your drowsiness then pull both your earlobes and rub your limbs with your hands it s possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness but if by doing this you don t shake off your drowsiness then get up from your seat and after washing your eyes out with water look around in all directions and upward to the major stars constellations it s possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness but if by doing this you don t shake off your drowsiness then attend to the perception of light resolve on the perception of daytime dwelling by night as by day and by day as by night by means of an awareness thus open unhampered develop a brightened mind it s possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness but if by doing this you don t shake off your drowsiness then percipient of what lies in front behind set a distance to meditate walking back forth your senses inwardly immersed your mind not straying outwards it s possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness but if by doing this you don t shake off your drowsiness then reclining on your right side take up the lion s posture one foot placed on top of the other mindful alert with your mind set on getting up as soon as you wake up get up quickly with the thought i won t stay indulging in the pleasure of lying down the pleasure of reclining the pleasure of drowsiness that is how you should train yourself furthermore moggallana should you train yourself i will not visit families with my pride furthermore moggallana should you train yourself i will speak no confrontational speech that is how you should train yourself when there is confrontational speech a lot of discussion can be expected when there is a lot of discussion there is restlessness one who is restless becomes unrestrained unrestrained his mind is far from concentration it s not the case moggallana that i praise association of every sort but it s not the case that i dispraise association of every sort i don t praise association with householders and renunciates but as for dwelling places that are free from noise free from sound their atmosphere devoid of people appropriately secluded for resting undisturbed by human beings i praise association with dwelling places of this sort when this was said ven moggallana said to the blessed one briefly lord in what respect is a monk released through the ending of craving utterly complete utterly free from bonds a follower of the utterly holy life utterly consummate foremost among human heavenly beings there is the case moggallana where a monk has heard all phenomena are unworthy of attachment having heard that all phenomena are unworthy of attachment he fully knows all things fully knowing all things he fully comprehends all things fully comprehending all things then whatever feeling he experiences pleasure pain neither pleasure nor pain he remains focused on inconstancy focused on dispassion focused on cessation focused on relinquishing with regard to that feeling as he remains focused on inconstancy focused on dispassion focused on cessation focused on relinquishing with regard to that feeling he is unsustained by it is in this respect moggallana that a monk in brief is released through the ending of craving utterly complete utterly free from bonds a follower of the utterly holy life utterly consummate foremost among human heavenly beings monks when a monk becomes entirely dispassionate towards one thing when his lust for it entirely fades away when he is entirely liberated from it when he sees the complete ending of it then he is one who after fully comprehending the goal makes an end of suffering here and now what one thing all beings subsist by nutriment when a monk becomes entirely dispassionate towards this one thing nutriment when his lust for it entirely fades away when he is entirely liberated from it and when he sees the complete ending of it then o monks he is one who after fully comprehending the goal makes an end of suffering here and now at one time the buddha was living in magadha just below the hills near a brahman village called ekanala at that time the brahman kasibharadvaja had yoked together a number of plows for it was planting time the buddha arose in the morning and having dressed and taken up his bowl he went up to where the brahman kasibharadvaja was working at that time the farmer was feeding his workers so the buddha went up to where that feeding was taking place and stood to one side seeing the buddha standing for alms the brahman kasibharadvaja said this to him i recluse plow and sow and only after having plowed and sown do i eat you too should plow and sow and only after having plowed and sown should you eat i do indeed plow and sow brahman replied the buddha and only after having plowed and sown do i eat but gotama we do not see your yoke and plow nor your plowshare oxen or goad and yet you say you plow and sow and eat only after having plowed and sown and then the brahman kasibharadvaja addressed the buddha with this verse so you claim to be a farmer but we do not see you plowing tell me since you re asked of plowing so i ll know what you call plowing then the brahman kasibharadvaja filled a large bronze bowl with food and offered it to the buddha please eat gotama sir this food you are indeed a farmer surely you plow the plowing that yields the crop of deathlessness the buddha replies thisdwelling at just as if a great mass of fire of ten twenty thirty or forty cartloads of timber were burning into which a man simply would i departed i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at then the blessed one early in the morning put on his robes and carrying his bowl outer robe went into savatthi for alms having gone for alms in savatthi after the meal returning from his alms round he said to ven rahula fetch your sitting cloth rahula we will go to the grove of the blind to spend the day responding as you say lord to the blessed one ven rahula carrying his sitting cloth followed behind the blessed one now at that time many thousands of devas were following behind the blessed one thinking today the blessed one will lead ven rahula further to the ending of the mental fermentations then the blessed one having plunged into the grove of the blind sat down on a seat made ready at the foot of a tree ven rahula having bowed down to the blessed one sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him what do you think rahula is the eye constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord what do you think are forms constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord what do you think is consciousness at the eye constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord what do you think is contact at the eye constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord what do you think whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye as a mode of feeling a mode of perception a mode of fabrication or a mode of consciousness inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord what do you think rahula is the ear constant or inconstant inconstant lord what do you think rahula is the nose constant or inconstant inconstant lord what do you think rahula is the tongue constant or inconstant inconstant lord what do you think rahula is the body constant or inconstant inconstant lord what do you think rahula is the intellect constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord what do you think are ideas constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord what do you think is consciousness at the intellect constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord what do you think is contact at the intellect constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord what do you think whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect as a mode of feeling a mode of perception a mode of fabrication or a mode of consciousness is it constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord seeing thus rahula the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with the eye disenchanted with forms disenchanted with consciousness at the eye disenchanted with contact at the eye and whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye as a mode of feeling a mode of perception a mode of fabrication or a mode of consciousness with that too he grows disenchanted he grows disenchanted with the ear he grows disenchanted with the nose he grows disenchanted with the tongue he grows disenchanted with the body he grows disenchanted with the intellect disenchanted with ideas disenchanted with consciousness at the intellect disenchanted with contact at the intellect and whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect as a mode of feeling a mode of perception a mode of fabrication or a mode of consciousness with that too he grows disenchanted disenchanted he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is fully released with full release there is the knowledge fully released he discerns that birth is depleted the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world and when monks the ariyan disciple understands as they really are the arising and the passing away the attractiveness and the danger and the deliverance from the five groups of clinging he is called an ariyan disciple who is a stream winner not liable to states of woe monks i will teach you a one

and that for what has come into being there is aging death therefore with the total ending fading away cessation letting go relinquishment of craving the tathagata has totally awakened to the unexcelled right self awakening i tell you he directly knows water as water the all as the all he directly knows unbinding as unbinding directly knowing unbinding as unbinding he does not conceive

cessation letting go relinquishment of craving the tathagata has totally awakened to the unexcelled right self awakening i tell you that is what the blessed one said displeased the monks did not delight in the blessed one s words now what do you think anuraadha is the body permanent or impermanent impermanent lord well then anuraadha do you equate the tathaagata with his body no indeed lord do you consider he has no body feelings perceptions mental formations consciousness no indeed lord then anuraadha since in this very life the tathaagata is not to be regarded as really and truly existing is it proper for you to declare of him friends he who is a tathaagata can be described otherwise than in these four ways no indeed lord good good anuraadha as before so now i proclaim just suffering and the ceasing of suffering i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the excellent mahanama excellent it is fitting for clansmen like you to approach the tathagata and ask for those of us living by means of various dwelling places for the mind by means of which dwelling place should we live one who is aroused to practice is one of conviction not without conviction one aroused to practice is one with persistence aroused not lazy one aroused to practice is one of established mindfulness not muddled mindfulness one aroused to practice is centered in concentration not uncentered one aroused to practice is discerning not undiscerning established in these five qualities you should further develop six qualities of one who does this mahanama it is said among those who are out of tune the disciple of the noble ones dwells in tune among those who are malicious he dwells without malice having attained the stream of dhamma he develops the recollection of the buddha of one who does this mahanama it is said among those who are out of tune the disciple of the noble ones dwells in tune among those who are malicious he dwells without malice having attained the stream of dhamma he develops the recollection of the dhamma of one who does this mahanama it is said among those who are out of tune the disciple of the noble ones dwells in tune among those who are malicious he dwells without malice having attained the stream of dhamma he develops the recollection of the sangha of one who does this mahanama it is said among those who are out of tune the disciple of the noble ones dwells in tune among those who are malicious he dwells without malice having attained the stream of dhamma he develops the recollection of virtue of one who does this mahanama it is said among those who are out of tune the disciple of the noble ones dwells in tune among those who are malicious he dwells without malice having attained the stream of dhamma he develops the recollection of generosity of one who does this mahanama it is said among those who are out of tune the disciple of the noble ones dwells in tune among those who are malicious he dwells without malice having attained the stream of dhamma he develops the recollection of the devas with what virtue what behavior nurturing what actions would a person become rightly based and attain the ultimate goal one should be respectful of one s superiors for a lay person there are these five rewards of conviction which five when the truly good people in the world show compassion they will first show compassion to people of conviction and not to people without conviction when visiting they first visit people of conviction and not people without conviction when accepting gifts they will first accept those from people with conviction and not from people without conviction when teaching the dhamma they will first teach those with conviction and not those without conviction a person of conviction on the break up of the body after death will arise in a good destination the heavenly world for a lay person these are the five rewards of conviction a massive tree whose branches carry fruits leaves with trunks roots an abundance of fruits there the birds find rest in that delightful sphere they make their home those seeking shade come to the shade those seeking fruit find fruit to eat so with the person consummate in virtue conviction humble sensitive gentle delightful mild to him come those without effluent free from passion free from aversion free from delusion the field of merit for the world they teach him the dhamma that dispels all stress and when he understands he is freed from effluents totally unbound staying at savatthi monks suppose there were four strong archers well trained practiced drilled standing in the four directions and a man were to come along saying i will catch bring down the arrows let fly by these four strong archers well trained practiced drilled before they have fallen to the ground what do you think would that be enough to call him a swift man endowed with the foremost speed even if he were to catch bring down the arrows let fly by one archer well trained practiced drilled before they fell to the ground lord that would be enough to call him a swift man endowed with the foremost speed to say nothing of four such archers faster than the speed of that man monks is the speed of the sun moon faster than the speed of that man faster than the speed of the sun moon is the speed of the devas who rush ahead of the sun moon faster than the speed of that man faster than the speed of the sun moon faster than the speed of the devas who rush ahead of the sun moon the force of one s life span comes to an end thus you should train yourselves we will live heedfully that s how you should train yourselves dwelling at the buddha to say the one who acts is the same one who experiences is one extreme the brahman then master gotama is the one who acts someone other than the one who experiences the buddha to say the one who acts is someone other than the one who experiences is the second extreme avoiding both of these extremes the tathagata teaches the dhamma by means of the middle from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications from fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name form from name form as a requisite condition come the six sense media from the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact from contact as a requisite condition comes feeling from feeling as a requisite condition comes craving from craving as a requisite condition comes clinging sustenance from clinging sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth from birth as a requisite condition then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair come into play such is the origination of this entire mass of stress suffering now from the remainderless fading cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications from the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness from the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name form from the cessation of name form comes the cessation of the six sense media from the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact from the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling from the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving from the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging sustenance from the cessation of clinging sustenance comes the cessation of becoming from the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth from the cessation of birth then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair all cease such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress suffering when this was said the brahman said to the blessed one at savatthi as he was sitting to one side king pasenadi kosala said to the blessed one just now lord as i was sitting in judgment i saw that even affluent nobles affluent brahmans affluent householders rich with great wealth property with vast amounts of gold silver vast amounts of valuables commodities vast amounts of wealth grain tell deliberate lies with sensual pleasures as the cause sensual pleasures as the reason simply for the sake of sensual pleasures then the thought occured to me i ve had enough of this judging let some other fine fellow be known for his judgments that s the way it is great king that s the way it is even affluent nobles affluent brahmans affluent householders tell deliberate lies with sensual pleasures as the cause sensual pleasures as the reason simply for the sake of sensual pleasures that will lead to their long term harm pain that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further impassioned with sensual possessions greedy dazed by sensual pleasures they don t awaken to the fact that they ve gone too far like fish into a trap set out afterwards it s bitter for them evil for them the result now what is the faculty of conviction there is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones has conviction is convinced of the tathagata s awakening indeed the blessed one is worthy and rightly self awakened consummate in knowledge conduct well gone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the teacher of divine human beings awakened blessed this is called the faculty of conviction and what is the faculty of persistence there is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities he is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities he generates desire endeavors arouses persistence upholds exerts his intent for the sake of the non arising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the sake of the abandoning of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen and for the maintenance non confusion increase plenitude development culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen this is called the faculty of persistence and what is the faculty of concentration there is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones making it his object to let go attains concentration attains singleness of mind quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress he enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain this is called the faculty of concentration and what is the faculty of discernment there is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones is discerning endowed with discernment of arising passing away noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress he discerns as it has come to be this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress this is called the faculty of discernment these are the five faculties the world in general kaccaayana inclines to two views to existence the world in general kaccaayana grasps after systems and is imprisoned by dogmas everything exists todeyya the buddha todeyya the buddha thus have i heard at one time the blessed one was staying at raajagaha in the tapodaa park now the venerable samiddhi as dawn approached arose and went to the hot springs having had no sport monk seeking alms then the she deva came down to earth and said to samiddhi you are young bhikkhu to have left the world black haired with the bloom of youth in your youthful prime you do not enjoy the pleasures of the senses get your fill bhikkhu of human pleasures don t reject the present moment to pursue what time will bring i friend do not reject the present moment to pursue what time will bring i reject what time will bring to pursue the present moment time s pleasures friend as the blessed one has said are fraught with pain fraught with tribulation leading to greater danger this dhamma is here present out of time inviting inspection leading onward to be realized by the wise each for himself in what way bhikkhu has the blessed one said that time s pleasures are fraught with pain fraught with tribulation and leading to greater danger in what way is this dhamma here present out of time inviting inspection leading onward to be realized by the wise each for himself i friend am fresh having not long left the world a newcomer i am not able to explain in detail this dhamma and discipline but the blessed one the arahant the fully self enlightened one is staying at raajagaha in the tapodaa park go to the blessed one and ask him about the matter then bear in the mind the explanation he gives to you it is not easy for us bhikkhu to approach the blessed one he is surrounded by other devas of great power if you bhikkhu will approach the blessed one and ask him about the matter then perhaps we can come to hear the teaching very well friend the venerable samiddhi replied to her and he went to the blessed one made his obeisance and sat down to one side if lord that deva was telling the truth she is right here not far away when he had said this the deva said to the venerable samiddhi ask him bhikkhu ask him i ve managed to get here then the blessed one addressed the deva in verse those who go by names who go by concepts making their abode in names and concepts failing to discern the naming process these are subject to the reign of death he who has discerned the naming process does not suppose that one who names exists no such case exists for him in truth whereby one could say he s this or that lord i do not fully grasp the meaning of what your blessedness has expressed in brief it would be well for me lord if your blessedness would explain in full what has been expressed in brief that i may know its meaning lord neither do i full grasp the meaning of this which your blessedness has expressed in brief it would be well for me lord if your blessedness would explain in full what has been explained in brief that i may know its meaning lord the meaning of what your blessedness has expressed in brief i understand in full like this one should do no evil by one s speech not anywhere by body or in thought leave desires be mindful and aware thus avoiding pain that s purposeless samiddhi replied at savatthi monks eye consciousness is inconstant changeable alterable ear consciousness nose consciousness tongue consciousness body consciousness intellect consciousness is inconstant changeable alterable one who has conviction belief that these phenomena are this way is called a faith follower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the run of the mill he is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry shades he is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry one who after pondering with a modicum of discernment has accepted that these phenomena are this way is called a dhamma follower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the run of the mill he is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry shades he is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry one who knows and sees that these phenomena are this way is called a stream enterer steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for self awakening i have heard that on one occasion when the blessed one was newly self awakened he was staying at then the thought occurred to him it would be for the sake of perfecting an unperfected aggregate of virtue that i would dwell in dependence on another brahman or contemplative honoring and respecting him however in this world with its devas it would be for the sake of perfecting an unperfected aggregate of concentration that i would dwell in dependence on another brahman or contemplative honoring and respecting him however in this world with its devas maras brahmas in this generation with its brahmans and contemplatives its royalty and common folk i do not see another brahman or contemplative more consummate in concentration than i on whom i could dwell in dependence honoring and respecting him it would be for the sake of perfecting an unperfected aggregate of discernment that i would dwell in dependence on another brahman or contemplative honoring and respecting him however in this world with its devas maras brahmas in this generation with its brahmans and contemplatives its royalty and common folk i do not see another brahman or contemplative more consummate in discernment than i on whom i could dwell in dependence honoring and respecting him it would be for the sake of perfecting an unperfected aggregate of release that i would dwell in dependence on another brahman or contemplative honoring and respecting him however in this world with its devas maras brahmas in this generation with its brahmans and contemplatives its royalty and common folk i do not see another brahman or contemplative more consummate in release than i on whom i could dwell in dependence honoring and respecting him it would be for the sake of perfecting an unperfected aggregate of knowledge and vision of release that i would dwell in dependence on another brahman or contemplative honoring and respecting him however in this world with its devas maras brahmas in this generation with its brahmans and contemplatives its royalty and common folk i do not see another brahman or contemplative more consummate in knowledge and vision of release than i on whom i could dwell in dependence honoring and respecting him what if i were to dwell in dependence on this very dhamma to which i have fully awakened honoring and respecting it then having known with his own awareness the line of thinking in the blessed one s awareness that is what brahma sahampati said having said that he further said this past buddhas future buddhas he who is the buddha now removing the sorrow of many all have dwelt will dwell he dwells revering the true dhamma this for buddhas is a natural law therefore one who desires his own good aspiring for greatness should respect the true dhamma recollecting the buddhas teaching fear is born from arming oneself just see how many people fight i ll tell you about the dreadful fear that caused me to shake all over seeing creatures flopping around like fish in water too shallow so hostile to one another seeing this i became afraid this world completely lacks essence it trembles in all directions i longed to find myself a place unscathed but i could not see it seeing people locked in conflict i became completely distraught but then i discerned here a thorn hard to see lodged deep in the heart it s only when pierced by this thorn that one runs in all directions so if that thorn is taken out one does not run and settles down who here has crossed over desires the world s bond so hard to get past he does not grieve she does not mourn his stream is cut she s all unbound what went before let go of that all that s to come have none of it don t hold on to what s in between and you ll wander fully at peace for whom there is no i making all throughout the body and mind and who grieves not for what is not is undefeated in the world for whom there is no this is mine nor anything like that is theirs not even finding self ness he does not grieve at i have nothing buddha hero praise be to you you foremost among all beings you who have released me from pain and so many other beings too all suffering has been understood the source of craving has withered cessation has been touched by me on the noble eight fold path i ve been mother and son before and father brother grandmother too not understanding what was real i flowed on without finding peace but now i ve seen the blessed one this is my last compounded form the on flowing of birth has expired there s no more re becoming now see the gathering of followers putting forth effort self controlled always with strong resolution this is how to honor the buddhas surely for the good of so many did maya give birth to gotama who bursts asunder the mass of pain of those stricken by sickness and death thus have i heard at one time the lord was staying near savatthi in the jeta wood at anathapindika s monastery on that occasion the lord was instructing the bhikkhus with a dhamma talk connected with nibbana and those bhikkhus were intent on listening to dhamma then on realizing its significance the lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance i thoughts before going forth when o when shall i live all alone in mountain caves unmated with desire clear seeing as unstable all that comes to be this wish of mine when indeed will it be when shall i wearing the patchwork robes of color dun be sage uncraving never making mine with greed aversion and delusion slain and to the wild woods gone in bliss abide when shall i this body seeing clear unstable nest of dying and disease oppressed by age and death dwell free from fear in the woods alone when indeed will it be when indeed shall i dwell seizing the sharpened sword of wisdom made when cut the craving creeper breeder of fear bringer of pain and woe and twining everywhere when indeed will it be when lion like in the victor s stance shall i draw quick the sage s sword of wisdom forged and fiery might quick breaking mara with his host when indeed will it be when myself exerting shall i be seen in goodly company of those esteeming dhamma those with faculties subdued who see things as they are those who are thus when indeed will it be when indeed will weariness not worry me hunger thirst and wind heat bugs and creeping things while bent on my own good the goal in giribbaja s wilds when indeed will it be when indeed shall i self mindful and composed win to that wisdom known by him the greatest sage the four truths won within so very hard to see when indeed will it be when shall i possessed of meditation s calm with wisdom see the forms innumerable sounds smells and tastes touches and dhammas too as a raging blaze when will this be for me when shall i indeed when with abusive words addressed not be displeased because of that and then again when praised be neither pleased because of that when will this be for me when shall i indeed weigh as the same wood grass and creepers with these craved for groups both inner and external forms the dhammas numberless when will it be for me when in the season of the black raincloud shall i follow the path within the wood trodden by those that see robes moistened by new falling rain when indeed will it be when in a mountain cave having heard the peacock s cry that crested twice born bird down in the wood shall i arise and collect together mind for attaining the undying when indeed will it be when shall i the ganges and the yamuna the sarasvati and the awful ocean mouth of the balava abyss by psychic might untouching go across when indeed will it be when shall i like charging elephant unbound break up desire for sensual happiness and shunning all the marks of loveliness strive in concentrated states when indeed will it be when as pauper by his debts distressed by creditors oppressed a treasure finds shall i be pleased the teaching to attain of the greatest sage when indeed will it be ii self admonishments after going forth long years have i been begged by you enough for you of this living in a house by now i have gone forth to homelessness what reason is there mind for you not to urge me on was i not o mind assured by you indeed the brightly plumaged birds on giribbaja s peaks greeting the thunder the sound of great indra will bring to you joy meditating in the wood dear ones and friends and kin within the family playing and loving sensual pleasures of the world all have i given up and reached at last to this even now o mind you are not pleased with me mine you are mind possessed by none but me why then lament when comes this time to arm seeing all as unstable this is now renounced longing for desirous of the undying state said he who speaks the best best among mankind man taming trainer physician great indeed unsteady likened to a monkey is the mind extremely hard to check by not rid of lust for varied sweet delightful are desires of sense blind foolish common men long have lain in them seeking after birth again tis they who wish for ill by

made mind that do you desire when on me urge the unstable and the frail formless one far traveler a wanderer alone no more shall i your bidding do for sense desires are ill leading to bitter fruit to brooding fear with mind nibbana turned i shall walk on not from lack of luck did i go forth nor shamelessness nor caused by mind s inconstancy nor banishment nor caused by livelihood and therefore i agreed with you o mind having few wishes disparagement s abandoning with the stilling of all ill is praised by goodly men so indeed my mind then you urged at me but now you go back to habits made of old craving unknowing the liked and the disliked delighting in forms and pleasing feelings too dear pleasures of the senses all have been vomited never to that vomit can i make myself return in every

ven mah kassapa ven mah kacc yana ven mah ko hita ven mah kappina ven mah cunda ven anuruddha ven revata and ven nandawhen this was said a certain monk who was a brahman by birth said to the blessed one to what extent lord is one a brahman and which are the qualities that make one a brahman then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed having banished evil qualities i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the sakyans near kapilavatthu in nigrodha s park then mahanama the sakyan went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one lord this kapilavatthu is rich prosperous populous crowded its alleys congested sometimes when i enter kapilavatthu in the evening after visiting with the blessed one or with the monks who inspire the mind i meet up with a runaway elephant a runaway horse a runaway chariot a runaway cart or a runaway person at times like that my mindfulness with regard to the blessed one gets muddled my mindfulness with regard to the dhamma the sangha gets muddled the thought occurs to me if i were to die at this moment what would be my destination what would be my future course have no fear mahanama have no fear your death will not be a bad one your demise will not be bad a disciple of the noble ones when endowed with four qualities leans toward unbinding slants toward unbinding inclines toward unbinding which four there is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in

you about one who dwells in heedlessness and one who dwells in heedfulness listen and pay careful attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said and how does one dwell in heedlessness when a monk dwells without restraint over the faculty of the eye the mind is stained with forms cognizable via the eye when the mind is stained there is no joy there being no joy there

out breathing now ananda if you go to the monk girimananda and tell him these ten perceptions it s possible that when he hears these ten perceptions his disease may be allayed then ven ananda having learned these ten perceptions in the blessed one s presence went to ven girimananda and told them to him as ven girimananda heard these ten perceptions his disease was allayed and ven girimananda recovered from his disease that was how ven girimananda s disease was abandoned at then by whom was this living being created where is the living being s maker where has the living being originated where does the living being cease then the thought occurred to vajira the nun now who has recited this verse a human being or a non human one then it occurred to her this is mara the evil one who has recited this verse wanting to arouse fear horripilation terror in me wanting to make me fall away from concentration then having understood that this is mara the evil one she replied to him in verses what do you assume a living being mara do you take a position this is purely a pile of fabrications here no living being can be pinned down just as when with an assemblage of parts there s the word then mara the evil one sad dejected at realizing vajira the nun knows me vanished right there i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the yes lord the monks responded the

the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a jungle grove the open air a heap of straw after his meal returning from his alms round he sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and brings mindfulness to the fore abandoning covetousness with regard to the world he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness he cleanses his mind of covetousness abandoning ill will and anger he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will sympathetic with the welfare of all living beings he cleanses his mind of ill will and anger abandoning sloth and drowsiness he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth and drowsiness mindful alert percipient of light he cleanses his mind of sloth and drowsiness abandoning restlessness and anxiety he dwells undisturbed his mind inwardly stilled he cleanses his mind of restlessness and anxiety abandoning uncertainty he dwells having crossed over uncertainty with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities he cleanses his mind of uncertainty in the same way when these five hindrances are not abandoned in himself the monk regards it as a debt a sickness a prison slavery a road through desolate country but when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself he regards it as unindebtedness good health release from prison freedom a place of security seeing that they have been abandoned within him he becomes glad glad he becomes enraptured enraptured his body grows tranquil his body tranquil he is sensitive to pleasure feeling pleasure his mind becomes concentrated the four jhanas quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters and remains in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluation he permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal furthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhana rapture and pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation internal assurance he permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composure and furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding he permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture and furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure and stress as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neither pleasure nor stress he sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness the three knowledges with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and re appearance of beings he sees by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human beings passing away and re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma these beings who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell but these beings who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world thus by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human he sees beings passing away and re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations he discerns as it has come to be that this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the way leading to the cessation of stress these are mental fermentations this is the origination of fermentations this is the cessation of fermentations this is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations his heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignorance with release there is the knowledge released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there s nothing further for this world this monks is called a monk who is a contemplative a brahman washed a master learned noble an arahant and how is a monk a contemplative and how is a monk a brahman his evil unskillful qualities that are defiled that lead to further becoming create trouble ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging death have been expelled and how is a monk washed his evil unskillful qualities that are defiled that lead to further becoming create trouble ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging death have been washed away this is how a monk is washed and how is a monk a master his evil unskillful qualities that are defiled that lead to further becoming create trouble ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging death have been mastered this is how a monk is a master and how is a monk learned and how is a monk noble and how is a monk an arahant his evil unskillful qualities that are defiled that lead to further becoming create trouble ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging death have gone far away that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion the young wife of a certain wanderer was pregnant and on the verge of delivery so she said to the wanderer go brahman get some oil for my delivery when this was said the wanderer said to her but where can i get any oil a second time she said to him go brahman get some oil for my delivery a second time he said to her but where can i get any oil a third time she said to him go brahman get some oil for my delivery now on that occasion at the storehouse of king pasenadi kosala contemplatives brahmans were being given as much oil or ghee as they needed to drink but not to take away so the thought occurred to the wanderer at present at the storehouse of king pasenadi kosala contemplatives brahmans are being given as much oil or ghee as they need to drink but not to take away suppose having gone there i were to drink as much oil as i need and on returning home vomiting it up were to give it to use at this delivery so having gone to the storehouse of king pasenadi kosala he drank as much oil as he needed but on returning home was unable to bring it up or pass it down so he rolled back forth suffering from fierce pains sharp severe then early in the morning the blessed one adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl robes went into s vatth for alms he saw the wanderer rolling back forth suffering from fierce pains sharp severe then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed how blissful it is for one who has nothing attainers of wisdom are people with nothing see him suffering one who has something a person bound in mind with people i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion there were many contemplatives brahmans wanderers of various sects living around s vatth with differing views differing opinions differing beliefs dependent for support on their differing views some of the contemplatives brahmans held this doctrine this view the self the cosmos are eternal only this is true anything otherwise is worthless some of the contemplatives brahmans held this doctrine this view the self the cosmos are not eternal the self the cosmos are both eternal and not eternal the self the cosmos are neither eternal nor not eternal the self the cosmos are self made the self the cosmos are other made the self the cosmos are both self made other made the self the cosmos without self making without other making are spontaneously arisen pleasure pain the self the cosmos are self made other made both self made other made pleasure pain the self the cosmos without self making without other making are spontaneously arisen only this is true anything otherwise is worthless and they kept on arguing quarreling disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying the dhamma is like this it s not like that the dhamma s not like that it s like this then in the early morning a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and carrying their bowls robes went into s vatth for alms having gone for alms in s vatth after the meal returning from their alms round they went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they said to the blessed one lord there are many contemplatives brahmans wanderers of various sects living around s vatth with differing views differing opinions differing beliefs dependent for support on their differing views and they keep on arguing quarreling disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying the dhamma is like this it s not like that the dhamma s not like that it s like this monks the wanderers of other sects are blind eyeless they don t know what is beneficial and what is harmful they don t know what is the dhamma and what is non dhamma not knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful not knowing what is dhamma and what is non dhamma they keep on arguing quarreling disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying the dhamma is like this it s not like that the dhamma s not like that it s like this then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed with regard to these things they re attached some contemplatives brahmans not reaching the footing see also monks i will teach you the all as a phenomenon to be abandoned listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said and which all is a phenomenon to be abandoned the eye is to be abandoned the ear is to be abandoned sounds are to be abandoned the nose is to be abandoned aromas are to be abandoned the tongue is to be abandoned flavors are to be abandoned the body is to be abandoned tactile sensations are to be abandoned the intellect is to be abandoned ideas are to be abandoned consciousness at the intellect

that too is to be abandoned this is called the all as a phenomenon to be abandoned i was a child with clean clothes when i first heard the dhamma and within me heedful was a break through to the truth then i arrived at an enormous dissatisfaction with all sensuality seeing the danger in self identity i longed only for renunciation leaving my circle of relatives slaves workers prosperous villages fields delightful enticing possessions i went forth abandoning not insignificant wealth having gone out through conviction in the well taught true dhamma it wouldn t be proper for me aspiring to nothingness having cast off gold silver to take them back gold silver don t buy awakening don t buy peace this gold isn t proper for contemplatives this isn t noble wealth this is greediness intoxication delusion bondage to dust suspicion many troubles there s no lasting stability here it s to this extent that many many men heedless their hearts defiled opposing one another create conflicts murder bondage calamity loss grief lamentation many misfortunes are seen for those head over heels in sensuality so my relatives why do you like enemies try to bind me to sensuality you know i ve gone forth seeing the danger in sensuality gold coin bullion can t put an end to fermentations sensuality is an enemy a murderer hostile arrows bonds so my relatives why do you like enemies try to bind me to sensuality you know i ve gone forth with shaven head wrapped in a patchwork cloak leftover alms scraps gleanings a robe made from cast off cloth that smara uppalavanna sakka these seven

they were good but later when his anger is gone he suffers as if burned with fire he is spoiled blotted out like fire enveloped in smoke when anger spreads when a man becomes angry he has no shame no fear of evil is not respectful in speech for a person overcome with anger nothing gives light i ll list the deeds that bring remorse that are far from the teachings listen an angry person kills his father kills his mother kills brahmans people run of the mill it s because of a mother s devotion that one sees the world yet an angry run of the mill person can kill this giver of life like oneself

beings and do violence to himself the angry person doesn t realize that he s ruined this snare of mara in the form of anger dwelling in the cave of the heart cut it out with self control discernment persistence right view the wise man would cut out each every form of unskillfulness train yourselves may we not be blotted out free from anger untroubled free from greed without longing tamed your anger abandoned free from fermentation you will be unbound i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at as he was sitting there he said to ven sariputta friend one of poor discernment one of poor discernment thus is it said to what extent is one said to be one of poor discernment one doesn t discern one doesn t discern thus friend one is said to be one of poor discernment and what doesn t one discern one doesn t discern this is stress one doesn t discern this is the origination of stress one doesn t discern this is the cessation of stress one doesn t discern this is the practice leading to the cessation of stress one doesn t discern one doesn t discern thus one is said to be one of poor discernment saying very good friend ven maha kotthita delighting in approving of ven sariputta s statement asked him a further question discerning discerning thus is it said to what extent friend is one said to be discerning one discerns one discerns thus friend one is said to be discerning and what does one discern one discerns this is stress one discerns this is the origination of stress one discerns this is the cessation of stress one discerns this is the practice leading to the cessation of stress one discerns one discerns thus one is said to be discerning consciousness consciousness thus is it said to what extent friend is it said to be consciousness it cognizes it cognizes thus friend it is said to be consciousness and what does it cognize it cognizes pleasant it cognizes painful it cognizes neither painful nor pleasant it cognizes it cognizes thus it is said to be consciousness discernment consciousness friend are these qualities conjoined or disjoined is it possible having separated them one from the other to delineate the difference between them discernment consciousness are conjoined friend not disjoined it s not possible having separated them one from the other to delineate the difference between them for what one discerns that one cognizes what one cognizes that one discerns therefore these qualities are conjoined not disjoined and it is not possible having separated them one from another to delineate the difference between them discernment consciousness friend what is the difference between these qualities that are conjoined not disjoined discernment consciousness friend of these qualities that are conjoined not disjoined discernment is to be developed consciousness is to be fully comprehended feeling feeling thus is it said to what extent friend is it said to be feeling it feels it feels thus friend it is said to be feeling and what does it feel it feels pleasure it feels pain it feels neither pleasure nor pain it feels it feels thus it is said to be feeling perception perception thus is it said to what extent friend is it said to be perception it perceives it perceives thus friend it is said to be perception and what does it perceive it perceives blue it perceives yellow it perceives red it perceives white it perceives it perceives thus it is said to be perception feeling perception consciousness friend are these qualities conjoined or disjoined is it possible having separated them one from another to delineate the difference among them feeling perception consciousness are conjoined friend not disjoined it is not possible having separated them one from another to delineate the difference among them for what one feels that one perceives what one perceives that one cognizes therefore these qualities are conjoined not disjoined and it is not possible having separated them one from another to delineate the difference among them friend what can be known with the purified intellect consciousness divorced from the five sense faculties friend with the purified intellect consciousness divorced from the five faculties the dimension of the infinitude of space can be known as infinite space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness can be known as infinite consciousness the dimension of nothingness can be known as there is nothing with what does one know a quality that can be known one knows a quality that can be known with the eye of discernment and what is the purpose of discernment the purpose of discernment is direct knowledge its purpose is full comprehension its purpose is abandoning friend how many conditions are there for the arising of right view friend there are two conditions for the arising of right view the voice of another and appropriate attention these are the two conditions for the arising of right view and assisted by how many factors does right view have awareness release as its fruit reward and discernment release as its fruit reward assisted by five factors right view has awareness release as its fruit reward and discernment release as its fruit reward there is the case where right view is assisted by virtue assisted by learning assisted by discussion assisted by tranquility assisted by insight assisted by these five factors right view has awareness release as its fruit reward and discernment release as its fruit reward friend how many kinds of becoming are there friend there are these three kinds of becoming sensual becoming form becoming formless becoming and how is further becoming in the future brought about the delight now here now there of beings hindered by ignorance fettered by craving that s how further becoming in the future is brought about and how is further becoming in the future not brought about through the fading of ignorance the arising of clear knowing the cessation of craving that s how further becoming in the future is not brought about what friend is the first jhana there is the case friend where a monk quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation this is called the first jhana and how many factors does the first jhana have the first jhana has five factors there is the case where in a monk who has attained the five factored first jhana there occurs directed thought evaluation rapture pleasure singleness of mind it s in this way that the first jhana has five factors and how many factors are abandoned in the first jhana and with how many is it endowed five factors are abandoned in the first jhana and with five is it endowed there is the case where in a monk who has attained the first jhana sensual desire is abandoned ill will is abandoned sloth torpor is abandoned restlessness anxiety is abandoned uncertainty is abandoned and there occur directed thought evaluation rapture pleasure singleness of mind it s in this way that five factors are abandoned in the first jhana and with five it is endowed friend there are these five faculties each with a separate range a separate domain and they do not experience one another s range domain the eye faculty the ear faculty the nose faculty the tongue faculty the body faculty now what do these five faculties each with a separate range a separate domain not experiencing one another s range domain the eye faculty the ear faculty the nose faculty the tongue faculty the body faculty have as their common arbitrator what experiences all their ranges domains friend these five faculties each with a separate range a separate domain not experiencing one another s range domain the eye faculty the ear faculty the nose faculty the tongue faculty the body faculty have the intellect as their common arbitrator the intellect is what experiences all their ranges domains now these five faculties the eye faculty the ear faculty the nose faculty the tongue faculty the body faculty in dependence on what do they remain standing these five faculties the eye faculty the ear faculty the nose faculty the tongue faculty the body faculty remain standing in dependence on vitality and vitality remains standing in dependence on what vitality remains standing in dependence on heat and heat remains standing in dependence on what heat remains standing in dependence on vitality just now friend sariputta we understood you to say vitality remains standing in dependence on heat and just now we understood you to say heat remains standing in dependence on vitality now how is the meaning of these statements to be seen in that case friend i will give you analogy for there are cases where it is through an analogy that an intelligent person understands the meaning of a statement suppose an oil lamp is burning its radiance is discerned in dependence on its flame and its flame is discerned in dependence on its radiance in the same way vitality remains standing in dependence on heat and heat remains standing in dependence on vitality friend are vitality fabrications vitality fabrications are not the same thing as feeling states friend if vitality fabrications were the same thing as feeling states the emergence of a monk from the attainment of the cessation of feeling perception would not be discerned it s because vitality fabrications are one thing and feeling states another that the emergence of a monk from the attainment of the cessation of perception feeling is discerned when this body lacks how many qualities does it lie discarded forsaken like a senseless log when this body lacks these three qualities vitality heat consciousness it lies discarded forsaken like a senseless log what is the difference between one who is dead who has completed his time and a monk who has attained the cessation of perception feeling in the case of the one who is dead who has completed his time his bodily fabrications have ceased subsided his verbal fabrications his mental fabrications have ceased subsided his vitality is exhausted his heat subsided his faculties are scattered but in the case of a monk who has attained the cessation of perception feeling his bodily fabrications have ceased subsided his verbal fabrications his mental fabrications have ceased subsided his vitality is not exhausted his heat has not subsided his faculties are exceptionally clear this is the difference between one who is dead who has completed his time and a monk who has attained the cessation of perception feeling friend how many conditions are there for the attainment of the neither pleasant nor painful awareness release friend there are four conditions for the attainment of the neither pleasant nor painful awareness release there is the case where a monk with the abandoning of pleasure stress as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain these are the four conditions for the attainment of the neither pleasant nor painful awareness release how many conditions are there for the attainment of the theme less awareness release there are two conditions for the attainment of the theme less awareness release lack of attention to all themes and attention to the theme less property these are the two conditions for the attainment of the theme less awareness release and how many conditions are there for the persistence of the theme less awareness release there are three conditions for the persistence of the theme less awareness release lack of attention to all themes attention to the theme less property and a prior act of will these are the three conditions for the persistence of the theme less awareness release and how many conditions are there for the emergence from the theme less awareness release there are two conditions for the emergence from the theme less awareness release attention to all themes and lack of attention to the theme less property these are the two conditions for the emergence from the theme less awareness release the immeasurable awareness release the nothingness awareness release the emptiness awareness release the theme less awareness release are these qualities different in meaning different in name or are they one in meaning and different only in name the immeasurable awareness release the nothingness awareness release the emptiness awareness release the theme less awareness release there is a way of explanation by which these qualities are different in meaning different in name and there is a way of explanation by which these qualities are one in meaning and different only in name and what is the way of explanation by which these qualities are different in meaning different in name there is the case where a monk keeps pervading the first direction he keeps pervading the first direction as well as the second direction the third the fourth with an awareness imbued with compassion an awareness imbued with appreciation he keeps pervading the first direction as well as the second direction the third the fourth with an awareness imbued with equanimity thus he keeps pervading above below all around everywhere in every respect the all encompassing world with an awareness imbued with equanimity abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will this is called the immeasurable awareness release and what is the nothingness awareness release there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness perceiving there is nothing enters remains in the dimension of nothingness this is called the nothingness awareness release and what is the emptiness awareness release there is the case where a monk having gone into the wilderness to the root of a tree or into an empty dwelling considers this this is empty of self or of anything pertaining to self and what is the theme less awareness release there is the case where a monk through not attending to all themes enters remains in the theme less concentration of awareness this is the way of explaining by which these qualities are different in meaning different in name and what is the way of explaining whereby these qualities are one in meaning and different only in name passion friend is a making of limits aversion is a making of limits delusion is a making of limits in a monk whose fermentations are ended these have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising now to the extent that there is immeasurable awareness release the unprovoked awareness release is declared the foremost and this unprovoked awareness release is empty of passion empty of aversion empty of delusion passion is a something aversion is a something delusion is a something in a monk whose fermentations are ended these have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising now to the extent that there is nothingness awareness release the unprovoked awareness release is declared the foremost and this unprovoked awareness release is empty of passion empty of aversion empty of delusion passion is a making of themes aversion is a making of themes delusion is a making of themes in a monk whose fermentations are ended these have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising now to the extent that there is theme less awareness release the unprovoked awareness release is declared the foremost and this unprovoked awareness release is empty of passion empty of aversion empty of delusion this friend is the way of explaining whereby these qualities are one in meaning and different only in name that is what ven sariputta said gratified ven maha kotthita delighted in ven sariputta s words on one occasion the blessed one was staying in yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said monks whatever in the cosmos with its devas maras brahmas its generations with their contemplatives brahmans royalty common people is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect that do i know whatever in the cosmos with its devas maras brahmas its generations with their contemplatives brahmans their royalty common people is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect that i directly know that has been realized by the tathagata but in the tathagata if i were to say i don t know whatever in the cosmos is seen heard sensed cognized pondered by the intellect that would be a falsehood in me if i were to say i both know and don t know whatever in the cosmos is seen heard sensed cognized pondered by the intellect that would be just the same if i were to say i neither know nor don t know whatever in the cosmos is seen heard sensed cognized pondered by the intellect that would be a fault in me thus monks the tathagata when seeing what is to be seen doesn t construe an object as seen he doesn t construe an unseen he doesn t construe an object to be seen he doesn t construe a seer when hearing when sensing when cognizing what is to be cognized he doesn t construe an object as cognized he doesn t construe an uncognized he doesn t construe an object to be cognized he doesn t construe a cognizer thus monks the tathagata being the same with regard to all phenomena that can be seen heard sensed cognized is such and i tell you there s no other such higher or more sublime whatever is seen or heard or sensed and fastened onto as true by others one who is such among the self fettered wouldn t further claim to be true or even false having seen well in advance that arrow where generations are fastened hung i know i see that s just how it is at no monk there is no form no feeling no perception there are no fabrications there is no consciousness that is constant lasting eternal not subject to change that will stay just as it is as long as eternity then the blessed one picking up a tiny bit of dust with the tip of his fingernail said to the monk there isn t even this much form that is constant lasting eternal not subject to change that will stay just as it is as long as eternity if there were even this much form that was constant lasting eternal not subject to change that would stay just as it is as long as eternity then this living of the holy life for the right ending of suffering stress would not be discerned but because there isn t even this much form that is constant lasting eternal not subject to change that will stay just as it is as long as eternity this living of the holy life for the right ending of suffering stress there isn t even this much feeling there isn t even this much perception there aren t even this many fabrications there isn t even this much consciousness that is constant lasting eternal not subject to change that will stay just as it is as long as eternity if there were even this much consciousness that was constant lasting eternal not subject to change that would stay just as it is as long as eternity then this living of the holy life for the right ending of suffering stress would not be discerned but because there isn t even this much consciousness that is constant lasting eternal not subject to change that will stay just as it is as long as eternity this living of the holy life for the right ending of suffering stress what do you think monk is form constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord is feeling constant or inconstant inconstant lord is perception constant or inconstant inconstant lord are fabrications constant or inconstant inconstant lord what do you think monk is consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord thus monk any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am any feeling whatsoever any perception whatsoever any fabrications whatsoever any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness disenchanted he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is fully released with full release there is the knowledge fully released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the but what do you see in me evil one that you say to me exercise rulership blessed one exercise rulership o one well gone without killing or causing others to kill without confiscating or causing others to confiscate without sorrowing or causing others sorrow righteously lord the blessed one has developed the four bases of power pursued them handed them the reins and taken them as a basis given them a grounding steadied them consolidated them and undertaken them well if he wanted to he could resolve on the himalayas king of mountains as gold and it would become a mountain of gold then mara the evil one sad dejected at realizing the blessed one knows me the one well gone knows me vanished right there the buddha the twenty five years since my going forth and no peace of awareness not a finger snap s worth attained having gained no oneness of mind i was wracked with lust wailing with my arms upheld i ran amok from my dwelling or or shall i take the knife what s the use of life to me if i were to renounce the training what sort of death would i have so taking a razor i sat down on a bed and there was the razor placed ready to cut my own vein when apt attention arose in me the drawbacks appeared disenchantment stood at an even keel with that my heart was released see the dhamma s true rightness the three knowledges have been attained the awakened one s bidding done monks there are these four modes of practice which four painful practice with slow intuition painful practice with quick intuition pleasant practice with slow intuition pleasant practice with quick intuition and which is painful practice with slow intuition there is the case where a certain individual is normally of an intensely passionate nature he perpetually experiences pain distress born of passion or he is normally of an intensely aversive nature he perpetually experiences pain distress born of aversion or he is normally of an intensely deluded nature he perpetually experiences pain distress born of delusion these five faculties of his the faculty of conviction the faculty of persistence the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of discernment appear weakly because of their weakness he attains only slowly the immediacy and which is painful practice with quick intuition there is the case where a certain individual is normally of an intensely passionate nature he perpetually experiences pain distress born of passion or he is normally of an intensely aversive nature he perpetually experiences pain distress born of aversion or he is normally of an intensely deluded nature he perpetually experiences pain distress born of delusion these five faculties of his the faculty of conviction the faculty of persistence the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of discernment appear intensely because of their intensity he attains quickly the immediacy that leads to the ending of the effluents this is called painful practice with quick intuition and which is pleasant practice with slow intuition there is the case where a certain individual is normally not of an intensely passionate nature he does not perpetually experience pain distress born of passion or he is normally not of an intensely aversive nature he does not perpetually experience pain distress born of aversion or he is normally not of an intensely deluded nature he does not perpetually experience pain distress born of delusion these five faculties of his the faculty of conviction the faculty of persistence the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of discernment appear weakly because of their weakness he attains only slowly the immediacy that leads to the ending of the effluents this is called pleasant practice with slow intuition and which is pleasant practice with quick intuition there is the case where a certain individual is normally not of an intensely passionate nature he does not perpetually experience pain distress born of passion or he is normally not of an intensely aversive nature he does not perpetually experience pain distress born of aversion or he is normally not of an intensely deluded nature he does not perpetually experience pain distress born of delusion these five faculties of his the faculty of conviction the faculty of persistence the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of discernment appear intensely because of their intensity he attains quickly the immediacy that leads to the ending of the effluents this is called pleasant practice with quick intuition these are the four modes of practice i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion ven mah kacc yana was living among the people of avant on pavatta mountain near the osprey habitat and at that time the lay follower so a ko ika a was ven mah kacc yana s supporter then as so a ko ika a was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to his awareness according to the dhamma that master mah kacc yana teaches it s not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell what if i were to shave off my hair beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness so he went to ven mah kacc yana and on arrival having bowed down to ven mah kacc yana sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to ven mah kacc yana just now venerable sir as i was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to my awareness according to the dhamma that master mah kacc yana teaches it s not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell what if i were to shave off my hair beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness give me the going forth master mah kacc yana when this was said ven mah kacc yana said to so a ko ika a it s hard so a the life long one meal a day sleeping alone holy life please right there as you are a householder devote yourself to the message of the awakened ones and to the proper time i e uposatha day one meal a day sleeping alone holy life and so so a ko ika a s idea of going forth subsided then a second time as so a ko ika a was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to his awareness according to the dhamma that master mah kacc yana teaches it s not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell what if i were to shave off my hair beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness so he went to ven mah kacc yana and on arrival having bowed down to ven mah kacc yana sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to ven mah kacc yana just now venerable sir as i was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to my awareness according to the dhamma that master mah kacc yana teaches it s not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell what if i were to shave off my hair beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness give me the going forth master mah kacc yana when this was said ven mah kacc yana said to so a ko ika a it s hard so a the life long one meal a day sleeping alone holy life please right there as you are a householder devote yourself to the message of the awakened ones and to the proper time one meal a day sleeping alone holy life and so so a ko ika a s idea of going forth subsided a second time then a third time as so a ko ika a was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to his awareness according to the dhamma that master mah kacc yana teaches it s not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell what if i were to shave off my hair beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness so he went to ven mah kacc yana and on arrival having bowed down to ven mah kacc yana sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to ven mah kacc yana just now venerable sir as i was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to my awareness according to the dhamma that master mah kacc yana teaches it s not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell what if i were to shave off my hair beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness give me the going forth master mah kacc yana so ven mah kacc yana gave so a ko ika a the going forth now at that time the southern country of avant was short of monks so only after three years having gathered from here there with hardship difficulty a quorum of ten community of monksso leaving seclusion in the late afternoon he went to ven mah kacc yana and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to ven mah kacc yana just now venerable sir as i was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to my awareness i haven t seen the blessed one face to face i ve simply heard that he is like this and like this if my preceptor would give me permission i would go to see the blessed one worthy rightly self awakened good so a very good go so a to see the blessed one worthy rightly self awakened you will see the blessed one who is serene inspires serene confidence his senses at peace his mind at peace one who has attained the utmost tranquility poise tamed guarded his senses restrained a great one saying as you say venerable sir ven so a delighting in approving of ven mah kacc yana s words got up from his seat bowed down to ven mah kacc yana circled him to the right set his lodging in order and taking his bowl robes set off wandering toward s vatth wandering by stages he arrived at s vatth jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery he went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one lord my preceptor ven mah kacc yana shows reverence with his head to the blessed one s feet and asks whether the blessed one is free from illness affliction is carefree strong living in comfort are you well monk are you in good health have you come along the road with only a little fatigue and are you not tired of alms food i am well blessed one i am in good health blessed one i have come along the road lord with only a little fatigue and i am not tired of alms food then the blessed one addressed ven nanda saying nanda prepare bedding for this visiting monk then the thought occurred to ven nanda when the blessed one orders me nanda prepare bedding for this visiting monk he wants to stay in the same dwelling with that monk the blessed one wants to stay in the same dwelling with ven so a so he prepared bedding for ven so a in the dwelling in which the blessed one was staying then the blessed one having spent much of the night sitting in the open air washed his feet and entered the dwelling likewise ven so a having spent much of the night sitting in the open air washed his feet and entered the dwelling then getting up toward the end of the night the blessed one invited ven mah so a responding as you say lord to the blessed one ven so a chanted all sixteen parts of the a haka vagga i have one rains blessed one but why did you take so long to ordain for a long time lord i have seen the drawbacks in sensuality but the household life is confining with many duties many things to be done then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed seeing the drawbacks of the world knowing the state without acquisitions a noble one doesn t find joy in evil in evil a clean one doesn t find joy i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion most of the people in s vatth were excessively attached to sensual pleasures they lived infatuated with greedy for addicted to fastened to absorbed in sensual pleasures then in the early morning a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and carrying their bowls robes went into s vatth for alms having gone for alms in s vatth after the meal returning from their alms round they went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they said to the blessed one most of the people in s vatth are excessively attached to sensual pleasures they live infatuated with greedy for addicted to fastened to absorbed in sensual pleasures then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed attached to sensual pleasures attached to sensual ties seeing no blame in the fetter never will those attached to the fetter the tie cross over the flood so great wide monks there are these nine step by step stoppings which nine

ferreted them out one after another known to him they arose known to him they remained known to him they subsided he discerned so this is how these qualities not having been come into play having been

earlier disappearance of elation distress sariputta entered remained in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain whatever qualities there are in the fourth jhana a feeling of equanimity neither pleasure nor pain an unconcern due to serenity of awareness furthermore with the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving infinite space sariputta entered remained in the dimension of the infinitude of space whatever qualities there are in the dimension of the infinitude of space the perception of the dimension of the infinitude of space singleness of mind contact feeling perception intention consciousness desire decision persistence mindfulness equanimity attention he ferreted them out one after another known to him they arose known to him they remained known to him they subsided he discerned so this is how these qualities not having been come into play having been they vanish he remained unattracted unrepelled with regard to those qualities independent detached released dissociated with an awareness rid of barriers he

perception he emerged mindfully from that attainment on emerging mindfully from that attainment he regarded the past qualities that had ceased changed so this is how these qualities not having been come into play having been they vanish he remained unattracted unrepelled with regard to those qualities independent detached released dissociated with an awareness rid of barriers he discerned that there is a further escape and pursuing it there really furthermore with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception sariputta entered remained in the cessation of feeling perception seeing with discernment his fermentations were totally ended he emerged mindfully from that attainment on emerging mindfully from that attainment he regarded the past qualities that had ceased changed so this is how these qualities not having been come into play having been they vanish he remained unattracted unrepelled with regard to those qualities independent detached released dissociated with an awareness rid of barriers he discerned that there is no further escape and pursuing it there really if a person rightly saying it of anyone were to say he has attained mastery perfection in noble virtue noble concentration noble discernment noble release he would be rightly saying it of sariputta if he were to say he has attained mastery perfection in noble virtue noble concentration noble discernment noble release if a person rightly saying it of anyone were to say he is the blessed one s son his offspring born of his mouth born of the dhamma created by the dhamma his heir in the dhamma not his heir in material things he would be rightly saying it of sariputta if he were to say he is the blessed one s son his offspring born of his mouth born of the dhamma created by the dhamma his heir in the dhamma not his heir in material things sariputta monks takes the unexcelled wheel of dhamma set rolling by the tathagata and keeps it rolling rightly that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words whence is there anger in one without anger tamed calmed living in tune released through right gnosis such you make things worse when you flare up at someone who s angry whoever doesn t flare up at someone who s angry wins a battle hard to win you live for the good of both your own the other s when knowing the other s provoked you mindfully grow calm when you work the cure of both your own the other s those who think you a fool know nothing of dhamma if anger arises reflect on the saw simile at savatthi there ven ananda addressed the monks friend monks yes friend the monks responded to him it s with possessiveness friend ananda that there is i am not without possessiveness and through possessiveness of what is there i am not without possessiveness through possessiveness of form there is i am not without possessiveness through possessiveness of feeling perception fabrications through possessiveness of consciousness there is i am not without possessiveness what do you think friend ananda is form constant or inconstant inconstant friend and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful friend and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no friend is feeling constant or inconstant inconstant friend is perception constant or inconstant inconstant friend are fabrications constant or inconstant inconstant friend what do you think friend ananda is consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant friend and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful friend and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no friend thus friend ananda any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am any feeling whatsoever any perception whatsoever any fabrications whatsoever any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness through disenchantment he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is fully released with full release there is the knowledge fully released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world friends ven punna mantaniputta was very helpful to us when we were newly ordained he exhorted us with this exhortation and when i had heard this dhamma explanation from ven punna mantaniputta i broke through to the dhamma at savatthi there the blessed one said monks do you develop mindfulness of in out breathing when this was said ven arittha replied to the blessed one but how do you develop mindfulness of in out breathing arittha having abandoned sensual desire for past sensual pleasures lord having done away with sensual desire for future sensual pleasures and having thoroughly subdued perceptions of irritation with regard to internal external events i breathe in mindfully and breathe out mindfully there is that mindfulness of in out breathing arittha i don t say that there isn t but as to how mindfulness of in out breathing is brought in detail to its culmination listen and pay close attention i will speak as you say lord ven arittha responded to the blessed one the blessed one said and how arittha is mindfulness of in out breathing brought in detail to its culmination there is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore breathing in long he discerns i am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns i am breathing out long or breathing in short he discerns i am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns i am breathing out short he trains himself i will breathe in sensitive to the entire body he trains himself i will breathe in sensitive to rapture he trains himself i will breathe out sensitive to rapture he trains himself i will breathe in sensitive to pleasure he trains himself i will breathe out sensitive to pleasure he trains himself i will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication he trains himself i will breathe in sensitive to the mind he trains himself i will breathe out sensitive to the mind he trains himself i will breathe in satisfying the mind he trains himself i will breathe out satisfying the mind he trains himself i will breathe in steadying the mind he trains himself i will breathe out steadying the mind he trains himself i will breathe in releasing the mind he trains himself i will breathe out releasing the mind he trains himself i will breathe in focusing on inconstancy he trains himself i will breathe out focusing on inconstancy he trains himself i will breathe in focusing on dispassion this arittha is how mindfulness of in out breathing is brought in detail to its culmination there are these and what is the training in and what is the training in heightened mind there is the case where a monk quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress he enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain this is called the training in heightened mind and what is the training in heightened discernment there is the case where a monk discerns as it actually is that this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress this is called the training in heightened discernment these are the three trainings and what is lack of restraint there is the case where a monk seeing a form with the eye is obsessed with pleasing forms is repelled by unpleasing forms and remains with body mindfulness unestablished with limited awareness he does not discern as it actually is present the awareness release the discernment release where any evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder hearing a sound with the ear smelling an aroma with the nose tasting a flavor with the tongue touching a tactile sensation with the body cognizing an idea with the intellect he is obsessed with pleasing ideas is repelled by unpleasing ideas and remains with body mindfulness unestablished with limited awareness he does not discern as it actually is present the awareness release the discernment release where any evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder then those six animals of different ranges of different habitats would each pull toward its own range habitat the snake would pull thinking i ll go into the anthill the crocodile would pull thinking i ll go into the water the bird would pull thinking i ll fly up into the air the dog would pull thinking i ll go into the village the hyena would pull thinking i ll go into the charnel ground the monkey would pull thinking i ll go into the forest and when these six animals became internally exhausted they would submit they would surrender they would come under the sway of whichever among them was the strongest in the same way when a monk whose mindfulness immersed in the body is undeveloped unpursued the eye pulls toward pleasing forms while unpleasing forms are repellent the ear pulls toward pleasing sounds the nose pulls toward pleasing aromas the tongue pulls toward pleasing flavors the body pulls toward pleasing tactile sensations the intellect pulls toward pleasing ideas while unpleasing ideas are repellent this monks is lack of restraint hearing a sound with the ear smelling an aroma with the nose tasting a flavor with the tongue touching a tactile sensation with the body cognizing an idea with the intellect he is not obsessed with pleasing ideas is not repelled by unpleasing ideas and remains with body mindfulness established with immeasurable awareness he discerns as it actually is present the awareness release the discernment release where all evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder just as if a person catching six animals of different ranges of different habitats were to bind them with a strong rope catching a snake he would bind it with a strong rope catching a crocodile a bird a dog a hyena a monkey he would bind it with a strong rope binding them all with a strong rope he would tether them to a strong post or stake then those six animals of different ranges of different habitats would each pull toward its own range habitat the snake would pull thinking i ll go into the anthill the crocodile would pull thinking i ll go into the water the bird would pull thinking i ll fly up into the air the dog would pull thinking i ll go into the village the hyena would pull thinking i ll go into the charnel ground the monkey would pull thinking i ll go into the forest and when these six animals became internally exhausted they would stand sit or lie down right there next to the post or stake in the same way when a monk whose mindfulness immersed in the body is developed pursued the eye does not pull toward pleasing forms and unpleasing forms are not repellent the ear does not pull toward pleasing sounds the nose does not pull toward pleasing aromas the tongue does not pull toward pleasing flavors the body does not pull toward pleasing tactile sensations the intellect does not pull toward pleasing ideas and unpleasing ideas are not repellent this monks is restraint thus you should train yourselves we will develop mindfulness immersed in the body we will pursue it hand it the reins and take it as a basis give it a grounding we will steady it consolidate it and set about it properly that s how you should train yourselves there are migajaala objects cognizable by the eye attractive pleasing charming agreeable enticing lust inspiring and if a monk takes pleasure in them welcomes them persists in clinging to them then because of this taking pleasure welcoming and persistent clinging enjoyment comes and from enjoyment infatuation infatuation brings bondage and a monk who is trapped in the bondage of enjoyment is called one who dwells with a mate ear nose tongue body but migajaala there are objects cognizable by the eye ear nose tongue body mind attractive pleasing charming agreeable enticing lust inspiring and if a monk takes no pleasure in them does not welcome them does not persist in clinging to them then because of his not taking pleasure not welcoming them and not persisting in clinging to them enjoyment fades away and without enjoyment there is no infatuation without infatuation no bondage is generated and the monk who is freed from the bondage of enjoyment is called one who dwells alone and a monk so dwelling migajaala even though he may live near a village crowded with monks and nuns male and female lay followers kings and royal ministers sectarians and their followers still he is termed one who dwells alone why is this so craving is the mate he has left behind and therefore he is called one who dwells alone monk if you cling to anything you are in bondage to maara i have understood blessed one i have understood well farer but how monk do you understand in full what i have stated in brief lord if one clings to the body one is in bondage to maara if one does not cling to the body one is free of the evil one good good monk you have well understood in full the sense of what i stated in brief if you cling to the body feelings perceptions mental formations consciousness you are in bondage to maara if you do not cling you are free of the evil one that is how the sense of what i have stated in brief is to be understood in full at savatthi then early in the morning vijaya the nun put on her robes and taking her bowl outer robe went into savatthi for alms when she had gone for alms in savatthi and had returned from her alms round after her meal she went to the grove of the blind to spend the day having gone deep into the grove of the blind she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day s abiding then mara the evil one wanting to arouse fear horripilation terror in her wanting to make her fall away from concentration approached her addressed her in verse you a beautiful young woman i a young man come my lady let s enjoy ourselves to the music of a five piece band then the thought occurred to vijaya the nun now who has recited this verse a human being or a non human one then it occurred to her this is mara the evil one who has recited this verse wanting to arouse fear horripilation terror in me wanting to make me fall away from concentration then having understood that this is mara the evil one she replied to him in verses lovely sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations i leave to you mara i have no need for them i m disgusted ashamed of this putrid body disintegrating dissolving sensual craving is rooted out beings who have come to form those with a share in the formless the peaceful attainments their darkness is completely destroyed then mara the evil one sad dejected at realizing vijaya the nun knows me vanished right there i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at a second time a third time kevatta the householder said to the blessed one i won t argue with the blessed one but i tell you lord this nalanda is powerful both prosperous and populous filled with people who have faith in the blessed one it would be good if the blessed one were to direct a monk to display a miracle of psychic power from his superior human state so that nalanda would to an even greater extent have faith in the blessed one a third time the blessed one said to kevatta the householder kevatta i don t teach the monks in this way come monks display a miracle of psychic power to the lay people clad in white kevatta there are these the miracle of psychic power and what is the miracle of psychic power there is the case where a monk wields manifold psychic powers having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one he appears he vanishes he goes unimpeded through walls ramparts and mountains as if through space he dives in and out of the earth as if it were water he walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land sitting cross legged he flies through the air like a winged bird with his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon so mighty and powerful he exercises influence with his body even as far as the brahma worlds then someone who has faith and conviction in him sees him wielding manifold psychic powers exercising influence with his body even as far as the brahma worlds he reports this to someone who has no faith and no conviction telling him isn t it awesome isn t it astounding how great the power how great the prowess of this contemplative just now i saw him wielding manifold psychic powers exercising influence with his body even as far as the brahma worlds then the person without faith without conviction would say to the person with faith and with conviction sir there is a charm called the gandhari charm by which the monk wielded manifold psychic powers exercising influence with his body even as far as the brahma worlds what do you think kevatta isn t that what the man without faith without conviction would say to the man with faith and with conviction yes lord that s just what he would say seeing this drawback to the miracle of psychic power kevatta i feel horrified humiliated and disgusted with the miracle of psychic power the miracle of telepathy and what is the miracle of telepathy there is the case where a monk reads the minds the mental events the thoughts the ponderings of other beings other individuals saying such is your thinking here is where your thinking is thus is your mind then someone who has faith and conviction in him sees him reading the minds of other beings he reports this to someone who has no faith and no conviction telling him isn t it awesome isn t it astounding how great the power how great the prowess of this contemplative just now i saw him reading the minds of other beings then the person without faith without conviction would say to the person with faith and with conviction sir there is a charm called the manika charm by which the monk read the minds of other beings what do you think kevatta isn t that what the man without faith without conviction would say to the man with faith and with conviction yes lord that s just what he would say seeing this drawback to the miracle of telepathy kevatta i feel horrified humiliated and disgusted with the miracle of telepathy the miracle of instruction and what is the miracle of instruction there is the case where a monk gives instruction in this way direct your thought in this way don t direct it in that attend to things in this way don t attend to them in that let go of this enter and remain in that this kevatta is called

aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion recollecting there i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose there there too i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose here thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and details this too is called the miracle of instruction with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and re appearance of beings he sees by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human beings passing away and re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma these beings who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell but these beings who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world thus by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human he sees beings passing away and re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma this too is called the miracle of instruction with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations he discerns as it has come to be that this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the way leading to the cessation of stress these are mental fermentations this is the origination of fermentations this is the cessation of fermentations this is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations his heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignorance with release there is the knowledge released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world this too is called the miracle of instruction these are the three miracles that i declare kevatta having directly known and realized them for myself once kevatta this train of thought arose in the awareness of a certain monk in this very community of monks where do these four great elements the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property cease without remainder then he attained to such a state of concentration that the way leading to the gods appeared in his centered mind so he approached the gods of the retinue of the four great kings and on arrival asked them friends where do these four great elements the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property cease without remainder when this was said the gods of the retinue of the four great kings said to the monk we also don t know where the four great elements cease without remainder but there are the four great kings who are higher and more sublime than we they should know where the four great elements cease without remainder so the monk approached the four great kings and on arrival asked them friends where do these four great elements cease without remainder when this was said the four great kings said to the monk we also don t know where the four great elements cease without remainder but there are the gods of the thirty three who are higher and more sublime than we they should know so the monk approached the gods of the thirty three and on arrival asked them friends where do these four great elements cease without remainder when this was said the gods of the thirty three said to the monk we also don t know where the four great elements cease without remainder but there is sakka the ruler of the gods who is higher and more sublime than we he should know so the monk approached sakka the ruler of the gods and on arrival asked him friend where do these four great elements cease without remainder when this was said sakka the ruler of the gods said to the monk i also don t know where the four great elements cease without remainder but there are the the yama gods said we also don t know but there is the god named suyama said i also don t know but there is the god named santusita said i also don t know but there are the the nimmanarati gods said we also don t know but there is the god named sunimmita said i also don t know but there are the the paranimmitavasavatti gods said we also don t know but there is the god named paranimmita so the monk approached the god vasavatti and on arrival asked him friend where do these four great elements cease without remainder when this was said the god vasavatti said to the monk i also don t know where the four great elements cease without remainder but there are the gods of the retinue of brahma who are higher and more sublime than i they should know where the four great elements cease without remainder then the monk attained to such a state of concentration that the way leading to the gods of the retinue of brahma appeared in his centered mind so he approached the gods of the retinue of brahma and on arrival asked them friends where do these four great elements the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property cease without remainder when this was said the gods of the retinue of brahma said to the monk we also don t know where the four great elements cease without remainder but there is but where friends is the great brahma now monk we also don t know where brahma is or in what way brahma is but when signs appear light shines forth and a radiance appears brahma will appear for these are the portents of brahma s appearance light shines forth and a radiance appears so the monk approached the great brahma and on arrival said friend where do these four great elements the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property cease without remainder when this was said the great brahma said to the monk i monk am brahma the great brahma the conqueror the unconquered the all seeing all powerful the sovereign lord the maker creator chief appointer and ruler father of all that have been and shall be a second time the monk said to the great brahma friend i didn t ask you if you were brahma the great brahma the conqueror the unconquered the all seeing all powerful the sovereign lord the maker creator chief appointer and ruler father of all that have been and shall be i asked you where these four great elements the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property cease without remainder a second time the great brahma said to the monk i monk am brahma the great brahma the conqueror the unconquered the all seeing all powerful the sovereign lord the maker creator chief appointer and ruler father of all that have been and shall be a third time the monk said to the great brahma friend i didn t ask you if you were brahma the great brahma the conqueror the unconquered the all seeing all powerful the sovereign lord the maker creator chief appointer and ruler father of all that have been and shall be i asked you where these four great elements the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property cease without remainder then the great brahma taking the monk by the arm and leading him off to one side said to him these gods of the retinue of brahma believe there is nothing that the great brahma does not know there is nothing that the great brahma does not see there is nothing of which the great brahma is unaware there is nothing that the great brahma has not realized that is why i did not say in their presence that i too don t know where the four great elements cease without remainder so you have acted wrongly acted incorrectly in bypassing the blessed one in search of an answer to this question elsewhere go right back to the blessed one and on arrival ask him this question however he answers it you should take it to heart then just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm the monk disappeared from the brahma world and immediately appeared in front of me having bowed down to me he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to me lord where do these four great elements the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property cease without remainder your question should not be phrased in this way where do these four great elements the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property cease without remainder instead it should be phrased like this where do water earth fire wind have no footing where are long short coarse fine fair foul name form brought to an end and the answer to that is consciousness without feature that is what the blessed one said gratified kevatta the householder delighted in the blessed one s words then the blessed one picking up a little bit of dust with the tip of his fingernail said to the monks what do you think monks which is greater the little bit of dust i have picked up with the tip of my fingernail or the great earth the great earth is far greater lord the little bit of dust the blessed one has picked up with the tip of his fingernail is next to nothing it doesn t even count it s no comparison it s not even a fraction this little bit of dust the blessed one has picked up with the tip of his fingernail when compared with the great earth in the same way monks few are the beings who on passing away from the human realm are reborn among human beings far more are the beings who on passing away from the human realm are reborn in hell therefore your duty is the contemplation this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress your duty is the contemplation this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress then the blessed one picking up a little bit of dust with the tip of his fingernail said to the monks what do you think monks which is greater the little bit of dust i have picked up with the tip of my fingernail or the great earth the great earth is far greater lord the little bit of dust the blessed one has picked up with the tip of his fingernail is next to nothing it doesn t even count it s no comparison it s not even a fraction this little bit of dust the blessed one has picked up with the tip of his fingernail when compared with the great earth in the same way monks few are the beings who on passing away from the human realm are reborn among human beings far more are the beings who on passing away from the human realm are reborn in the in the same way monks few are the beings who on passing away from the human realm are reborn among devas far more are the beings who on passing away from the human realm are reborn in in the same way monks few are the beings who on passing away from the deva realm are reborn among devas far more are the beings who on passing away from the deva realm are reborn in in the same way monks few are the beings who on passing away from the deva realm are reborn among human beings far more are the beings who on passing away from the deva realm are reborn in therefore your duty is the contemplation this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress your duty is the contemplation this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress just as a mighty mountain range scraping the sky with rocky crags might advance from four directions crushing everything before it so also do old age and death roll over all living beings nobles brahmans and working folk peasants outcastes and garbage men none of them can escape this end everybody surely gets crushed nothing on earth can defeat them not elephants chariots or troops nor the use of a magic spell nor can you buy safety with gold so the person who s firm and wise seeing what is best for themselves will place their faith in the buddha the dhamma and the sangha too one who practices the teaching with body and speech and with mind that one is praised here in this world and after enjoys the pure realms in seeing six rewards it s enough motivation for a monk to establish the perception of inconstancy with regard to all fabrications without exception which six all fabrications will appear as unstable my mind will not delight in any world my mind will rise above every world my heart will be inclined to unbinding my fetters in seeing these six rewards it s enough for a monk to establish the perception of inconstancy with regard to all fabrications without exception going forth through conviction from home into homelessness i wandered this place that greedy for gain offerings missing out on the foremost goal i pursued a lowly one under the sway of defilements i surrendered the goal of the contemplative life then sitting in my dwelling i suddenly came to my senses i m following a miserable path i m under the sway of craving next to nothing my life crushed by aging illness before the body breaks apart i have no time for heedlessness kappa stranded the buddha marai have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near yes lord the monks responded to him the blessed one said monks it s as if there were two households with doors and a man of good eyesight standing there between them would see people entering leaving a house wandering out about in the same way i by means of the divine eye purified surpassing the human see beings passing away re appearing and i discern how they are inferior superior beautiful ugly fortunate unfortunate in accordance with their actions o how these beings who were endowed with good conduct of body speech mind who did not revile noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in a good destination the heavenly world or how these beings who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech mind who reviled noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the realm of the hungry ghosts or how these beings who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech mind who reviled noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the animal womb or how these beings who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech mind who reviled noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hell then the hell wardens

devas that evil kamma was done by you yourself and you yourself will experience its result then having interrogated interpellated castigated the man regarding the fifth deva messenger king yama falls silent then the hell wardens torture the evil doer with what s called a five fold imprisonment they drive a red hot iron stake through one hand they drive a red hot iron stake through the other hand they drive a red hot iron stake through one foot they drive a red hot iron stake through the other foot they drive a red hot iron stake through the middle of his chest there he feels painful racking piercing feelings yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhausted then the hell wardens lay him down and slice him with axes then they hold him feet up head down and slice him with adzes then they harness him to a chariot and drive him back forth over ground that is burning blazing glowing then they make him climb up down a vast mountain of embers that is burning blazing glowing then they hold him feet up head down and plunge him into a red hot copper cauldron that is burning blazing glowing there he boils with bubbles foaming and as he is boiling there with bubbles foaming he goes now up he goes now down he goes now around there he feels painful racking piercing feelings yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhausted then the hell wardens throw him into the great hell and as to the great hell monks it s four cornered has four gates set in the middle of each side it s surrounded by an iron fortress wall and roofed with iron its floor is made of red hot iron heated fully blazing it stands always spreading leagues all around the flame that leaps from the eastern wall of the great hell strikes the western wall the flame that leaps from the western wall strikes the eastern wall the flame that leaps from the northern wall strikes the southern wall the flame that leaps from the southern wall strikes the northern wall the flame that leaps from the bottom strikes the top the flame that leaps from the top strikes the bottom there he feels painful racking piercing feelings yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhausted there comes a time when ultimately with the passing of a long stretch of time the eastern gate of the great hell opens he runs there rushing quickly as he runs there rushing quickly his outer skin burns his inner skin burns his flesh burns his tendons burn even his bones turn to smoke when his foot is lifted he is the just same there comes a time when ultimately with the passing of a long stretch of time the western gate of the great hell opens the northern gate the southern gate of the great hell opens he runs there rushing quickly as he runs there rushing quickly his outer skin burns his inner skin burns his flesh burns his tendons burn even his bones turn to smoke when his foot is lifted he is the just same but when he finally arrives the door slams shut there he feels painful racking piercing feelings yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhausted there comes a time when ultimately with the passing of a long stretch of time the eastern gate of the great hell opens he runs there rushing quickly as he runs there rushing quickly his outer skin burns his inner skin burns his flesh burns his tendons burn even his bones turn to smoke when his foot is lifted he is the just same he gets out through the gate but right next to the great hell is a vast excrement hell he falls into that and in that excrement hell needle mouth beings bore into his outer skin having bored into his outer skin they bore into his inner skin his flesh his tendons the bone having bored into the bone they feed on the marrow there he feels painful racking piercing feelings yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhausted right next to the excrement hell is the vast hot ashes hell he falls into that there he feels painful racking piercing feelings yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhausted right next to the hot ashes hell is the vast simbali forest with trees reaching up a league covered with thorns sixteen fingerbreadths long burning blazing glowing he enters that and is made to climb up down them there he feels painful racking piercing feelings yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhausted right next to the simbali forest is the vast sword leaf forest he enters that there the leaves stirred by the wind cut off his hand cut off his foot cut off his hand foot cut off his ear cut off his nose cut off his ear nose there he feels painful racking piercing feelings yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhausted right next to the sword leaf forest is the vast lye water river he falls into that there he is swept downstream he is swept upstream he is swept downstream upstream there he feels painful racking piercing feelings yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhausted then the hell wardens pull him out with a hook and placing him on the ground say to him well good man what do you want he replies i m hungry venerable sirs so the hell wardens pry open his mouth with red hot iron tongs burning blazing glowing and throw into it a copper ball burning blazing glowing it burns his lips it burns his mouth it burns his stomach and comes out the lower side carrying along his bowels intestines there he feels painful racking piercing feelings yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhausted then the hell wardens say to him well good man what do you want he replies i m thirsty venerable sirs so the hell wardens pry open his mouth with red hot iron tongs burning blazing glowing and pour into it molten copper burning blazing glowing it burns his lips it burns his mouth it burns his stomach and comes out the lower side carrying along his bowels intestines there he feels painful racking piercing feelings yet he does not die as long as his evil kamma is not exhausted then the hell wardens throw him back into the great hell once more once monks the thought occurred to king yama those who did evil actions in the world are tortured in these many ways o that i might gain the human state and that a tath gata worthy rightly self awakened might arise in the world and that i might attend to that tath gata and that he might teach me the dhamma and that i might understand his dhamma i tell you this monks not from having heard it from another contemplative or brahman on the contrary i tell you this just as i have known for myself seen for myself understood for myself that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further warned by the deva messengers those youths who are heedless grieve for a long long time people entering a lower state but those here who are good people of integrity when warned by the deva messengers aren t heedless of the noble dhamma ever seeing danger in clinging in the coming into play of birth death they are released from lack of clinging in the ending of birth death they happy arriving at safety fully unbound in the here now having gone beyond all animosity danger have escaped all suffering stress then the brahman very well then brahman in that case i will cross question you answer as you see fit what do you think there is the case where a tathagata appears in the world a worthy one rightly self awakened consummate in clear knowing conduct one who has gone the good way knower of the cosmos unexcelled trainer of those who can be taught teacher of human divine beings awakened blessed he says here this is the path this is the practice that having practiced i make known the unexcelled coming ashore in the holy life this being the case master gotama this practice of merit this business of going forth is one that benefits countless beings when this was said the brahman sangarava said to ven ananda just as with master gotama master ananda i worship them i praise them both a second time ven ananda said to him i didn t ask you whom you worship and whom you praise i ask you of these two practices brahman which appeals to you as the less complicated the less violent the more fruitful the more rewarding a second time the brahman sangarava said to ven ananda just as with master gotama master ananda i worship them i praise them both a third time ven ananda said to him i didn t ask you whom you worship and whom you praise i ask you of these two practices brahman which appeals to you as the less complicated the less violent the more fruitful the more rewarding a third time the brahman sangarava said to ven ananda just as with master gotama master ananda i worship them i praise them both then the thought occurred to the blessed one being asked a legitimate question by ananda up to the third time the brahman sangarava evades it and does not reply to it suppose i were to get him out of this dilemma so the blessed one said to the brahman sangarava brahman what was the topic of conversation that arose today when the royal court sat gathered in the royal palace master gotama this was the topic of conversation that arose today when the royal court sat gathered in the royal palace in the past there were fewer monks but more who endowed with superior human attainments displayed the miracle of psychic power now there are more monks but fewer who endowed with superior human attainments display the miracle of psychic power this master gotama was the topic of conversation that arose today when the royal court sat gathered in the royal palace then there is the case where a certain person reads another person s thoughts not by means of a sign or vision but by hearing the voice of human beings non human beings or devas saying such is your thinking here is where your thinking is thus is your mind and however much he may read that s exactly how it is and not otherwise then there is the case where a certain person reads another person s thoughts not by means of a sign or vision not by hearing the voice of human beings non human beings or devas but by hearing the sound of the directed thought evaluation of a person thinking directed thoughts and evaluating saying such is your thinking here is where your thinking is thus is your mind and however much he may read that s exactly how it is and not otherwise then there is the case where a certain person reads another person s thoughts not by means of a sign or vision not by hearing the voice of human beings non human beings or devas not by hearing the sound of the directed thought evaluation of a person thinking directed thoughts and evaluating but by having attained a concentration devoid of directed thought evaluation and encompassing the awareness of the other with his own awareness he discerns given the way the mental fabrications of this venerable person are inclined the directed thoughts of his mind will immediately think about this and however much he may read that s exactly how it is and not otherwise this brahman is the miracle of telepathy and these are the three miracles now brahman of these three miracles which one appeals to you as the highest most sublime master gotama of these three miracles the miracle of psychic power where a certain person wields manifold psychic powers and exercises influence with his body even as far as the brahma worlds that is a miracle experienced only by him who does it it belongs only to him who does it it seems to me to be of the nature of an illusion as for the miracle where a certain person by means of a sign or vision by hearing the voice of human beings non human beings or devas by hearing the sound of the directed thought evaluation of a person thinking directed thoughts and evaluating saying such is your thinking here is where your thinking is thus is your mind or who by having attained a concentration devoid of directed thought evaluation and encompassing the awareness of the other with his own awareness he discerns given the way the mental fabrications of this venerable person are inclined the directed thoughts of his mind will immediately think about this and however much he may read that s exactly how it is and not otherwise that is a miracle experienced only by him who does it it belongs only to him who does it it seems to me to be of the nature of an illusion as for the miracle where a certain person gives instruction in this way direct your thought in this way don t direct it in that attend to things in this way don t attend to them in that let go of this enter and remain in that this is the miracle that of the three appeals to me as the highest most sublime it is amazing master gotama it is astounding how well this has been said by master gotama and we hold that master gotama is endowed with these three marvels master gotama wields manifold psychic powers and exercises influence with his body even as far as the brahma worlds having attained a concentration devoid of directed thought evaluation and encompassing the awareness of the other with his own awareness master gotama discerns given the way the mental fabrications of this venerable person are inclined the directed thoughts of his mind will immediately think about this master gotama gives instruction in this way direct your thought in this way don t direct it in that attend to things in this way don t attend to them in that let go of this enter and remain in that of course brahman you have affronted me with your personal statement but nevertheless i will respond yes i wield manifold psychic powers and exercise influence with my body even as far as the brahma worlds having attained a concentration devoid of directed thought and evaluation and encompassing the awareness of the other with my own awareness i discern given the way the mental fabrications of this venerable person are inclined the directed thoughts of his mind will immediately think about this i give instruction in this way direct your thought in this way don t direct it in that attend to things in this way don t attend to them in that let go of this enter and remain in that aside from master gotama is there another monk who is endowed with these three miracles brahman there are not only one hundred other monks two three four five hundred other monks the monks who are endowed with these three miracles are many more than that and master gotama where do those monks now live in this very same community of monks now akkosaka yes good gotama sometimes such people come what do you think do you serve them with solid food soft food and savories yes good gotama sometimes but supposing brahman they do not accept what you offer whose is it if they do not accept good gotama then it belongs to us so it is here brahman the abuse the scolding the reviling you hurl at us who do not abuse or scold or revile we do not accept from you it all belongs to you brahman it all belongs to you if a man replies to abuse with abuse to scolding with scolding to reviling with reviling brahman that is like you joining your guests for dinner but we are not joining you for dinner it is all yours brahman it is all yours the king and his court believe that gotama the recluse is an arahant and yet the good gotama can get angry and another venerable bhaaradvaaja became an arahant the blessed one said in verse staying at savatthi then ven bhumija arising from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the blessed one my friend has said that pleasure pain are dependently co arisen dependent on what dependent on contact one speaking in this way would be speaking in line with what the blessed one has said would not be misrepresenting the blessed one with what is unfactual and would be answering in line with the dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the dhamma would have grounds for criticism whatever brahmans contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure pain are self made even that is dependent on contact whatever brahmans contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure pain are other made even that is dependent on contact whatever brahmans contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure pain are self made other made even that is dependent on contact whatever brahmans contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure pain are neither self made nor other made but arise spontaneously even that is dependent on contact that any brahmans contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure pain are self made would be sensitive to pleasure pain otherwise than through contact that isn t possible that any brahmans contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure pain are other made self made other made who declare that pleasure pain are neither self made nor other made but arise spontaneously would be sensitive to pleasure pain otherwise than through contact that isn t possible the blessed one said excellent ananda excellent one rightly answering would answer as ven sariputta has done i have said ananda that pleasure pain are dependently co arisen dependent on what dependent on contact one speaking in this way would be speaking in line with what i have said would not be misrepresenting me with what is unfactual and would be answering in line with the dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the dhamma would have grounds for criticism whatever brahmans contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure pain are self made even that is dependent on contact whatever brahmans contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure pain are other made self made other made neither self made nor other made but arise spontaneously even that is dependent on contact that any brahmans contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure pain are self made would be sensitive to pleasure pain otherwise than through contact that isn t possible that any brahmans contemplatives teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure pain are other made self made other made neither self made nor other made but arise spontaneously would be sensitive to pleasure pain otherwise than through contact that isn t possible when there is a body pleasure pain arise internally with bodily intention as the cause or when there is speech pleasure pain arise internally with verbal intention as the cause or when there is intellect pleasure pain arise internally with intellectual intention as the cause from ignorance as a requisite condition then either of one s own accord one fabricates bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure pain arise internally or because of others one fabricates bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure pain arise internally either alert one fabricates bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure pain arise internally or unalert one fabricates bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure pain arise internally similarly with verbal intellectual fabrications now ignorance is bound up in these things from the remainderless fading cessation of that very ignorance there no longer exists the sense of the body on account of which that pleasure pain internally arise there no longer exists the speech the intellect on account of which that pleasure pain internally arise there no longer exists the field the site the dimension or the issue on account of which that pleasure pain internally arise i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at then the monk admonished with this the blessed one s admonishment came to his senses so the blessed one having gone for alms in varanasi after the meal returning from his alms round addressed the monks and told them what had happened when this was said a certain monk said to the blessed one what lord is putrefaction what is the stench of carrion what are flies greed monk is putrefaction ill will is the stench of carrion evil unskillful thoughts are flies on one who lets himself putrefy stink with the stench of carrion there s no way that flies won t swarm attack on one whose eyes ears are unguarded whose senses are unrestrained flies swarm resolves dependent on passion the monk who is putrid who stinks of the stench of carrion is far from unbinding his share is vexation whether he stays in village or wilderness having gained for himself no tranquillity he s surrounded by flies but those who are consummate in virtue who delight in discernment calm pacified they sleep in ease no flies settle on them thus have i heard at one time the lord was staying near then the lord having put on his robe in the forenoon and taken his bowl and outer cloak entered kosambi for almsfood having walked for almsfood in kosambi and returned after the meal he set his lodging in order by himself took his bowl and cloak and without informing his attendant or taking leave of the order of bhikkhus he set off alone without a companion for now a certain bull elephant was living hemmed in by elephants and she elephants by elephant calves and sucklings he ate grass with the tips pulled off and they ate the branches he had broken down he drank muddied water and on going down and coming out of the water he was jostled by she elephants and he lived in discomfort and not at ease then that bull elephant thought at present i am living hemmed in by elephants and she elephants by elephant calves and sucklings i eat grass with the tips pulled off and they eat the branches which i break down i drink muddied water and on going down and coming out of the water i am jostled by she elephants and i live in discomfort and not at ease suppose i were to live alone secluded from the crowd so that bull elephant left the herd and went to parileyyaka to the protected forest and approached the lord at the foot of the auspicious sal tree on reaching the place where the lord was staying that bull elephant kept the place free of grass and brought water with his trunk for the lord s use then while the lord was in solitude and seclusion this thought arose in his mind formerly i was living hemmed in by bhikkhus and bhikkhunis and i was living in discomfort and not at ease but now i live not hemmed in by bhikkhus and bhikkhunis in comfort and at ease and also this thought arose in that bull elephant s mind formerly i was living hemmed in by elephants and she elephants and i was living in discomfort and not at ease but now i live not hemmed in by elephants and she elephants i eat unbroken grass and others do not eat the branches which i break down i drink clear water and on going down and coming out of the water i am not jostled by she elephants and i live in comfort and at ease then the lord on observing his own solitude understood with his mind the thought in the mind of that bull elephant and uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance this unites mind with mind the perfected one and the bull elephant with tusks as long as chariot poles that each delights in being alone in the forest full of the many clans of impurities the great manufacturer of excrement like a stagnant pool a great tumor great wound full of blood lymph immersed in a cesspool trickling liquids the body is oozing foulness always bound together with sixty sinews plastered with a stucco of muscle wrapped in a jacket of skin this foul body is of no worth at all linked together with a chain of bones stitched together with tendon threads it produces its various postures from being hitched up together headed surely to death in the presence of the king of mortality the man who learns to discard it right here goes wherever he wants covered with ignorance the body s tied down with a four fold tie mine never before have i seen or heard from anyone of a teacher with such lovely speech come together with his following from tusita heaven undertakingthe buddha born in a high ranking family with much property great wealth consummate in complexion figure i was the daughter of majjha get up sit up what s your need for sleep andstanding to one side a devata addressed the blessed one with a verse living in the wilderness staying peaceful remaining chaste eating just one meal a day why are their faces so bright serene the buddha from longing for the future thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was wandering in the the brahman householders of sala went to the blessed one and some paid homage to the blessed one and sat down at one side some exchanged greetings with him and when the courteous and amiable talk was finished sat down at one side some raised hands palms together in salutation to the blessed one and sat down at one side some pronounced their name and clan in the blessed one s presence and sat down at one side some kept silence and sat down at one side when they were seated they said to the blessed one master gotama what is the reason what is the condition why some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell and what is the reason what is the condition why some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world householders it is by reason of conduct not in accordance with the dhamma by reason of unrighteous conduct that beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell it is by reason of conduct in accordance with the dhamma by reason of righteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world we do not understand the detailed meaning of this utterance of master gotama s spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaning it would be good if master gotama taught us the dhamma so that we might understand the detailed meaning of master gotama s utterance spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaning then householders listen and heed well what i shall say yes venerable sir they replied the blessed one said this and how are there three kinds of bodily conduct not in accordance with the dhamma unrighteous conduct here someone is a killer of living beings he is murderous bloody handed given to blows and violence and merciless to all living beings he is a taker of what is not given he takes as a thief another s chattels and property in the village or in the forest he is given over to misconduct in sexual desires he has intercourse with such women as are protected by the mother father mother and father brother sister relatives as have a husband as entail a penalty and also with those that are garlanded in token of betrothal that is how there are three kinds of bodily conduct not in accordance with the dhamma unrighteous conduct and how are there four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the dhamma unrighteous conduct here someone speaks falsehood when summoned to a court or to a meeting or to his relatives presence or to his guild or to the royal family s presence and questioned as a witness thus so good man tell what you know then not knowing he says i know or knowing he says i do not know not seeing he says i see or seeing he says i do not see in full awareness he speaks falsehood for his own ends or for another s ends or for some trifling worldly end he speaks maliciously he is a repeater elsewhere of what is heard here for the purpose of causing division from these or he is a repeater to these of what is heard elsewhere for the purpose of causing division from those and he is thus a divider of the united a creator of divisions who enjoys discord rejoices in discord delights in discord he is a speaker of words that create discord he speaks harshly he utters such words as are rough hard hurtful to others censorious of others bordering on anger and unconducive to concentration he is a gossip as one who tells that which is unseasonable that which is not fact that which is not good that which is not the dhamma that which is not the discipline and he speaks out of season speech not worth recording which is unreasoned indefinite and unconnected with good that is how there are four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the dhamma unrighteous conduct and how are there three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance with the dhamma unrighteous conduct here someone is covetous he is a coveter of another s chattels and property thus oh that what is another s were mine or he has a mind of ill will with the intention of a mind affected by hate thus may these beings be slain and slaughtered may they be cut off perish or be annihilated or he has wrong view distorted vision thus there is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed no fruit and ripening of good and bad kammas no this world no other world no mother no father no spontaneously born beings so householders it is by reason of conduct not in accordance with the dhamma by reason of unrighteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell and how are there three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance with the dhamma righteous conduct here someone abandoning the killing of living beings becomes one who abstains from killing living beings with rod and weapon laid aside gentle and kindly he abides compassionate to all living beings abandoning the taking of what is not given he becomes one who abstains from taking what is not given he does not take as a thief another s chattels and property in the village or in the forest abandoning misconduct in sexual desires he becomes one who abstains from misconduct in sexual desires he does not have intercourse with such women as are protected by mother father father and mother brother sister relatives as have a husband as entail a penalty and also those that are garlanded in token of betrothal that is how there are three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance with the dhamma righteous conduct and how are there four of verbal conduct in accordance with the dhamma righteous conduct here someone abandoning false speech becomes one who abstains from false speech when summoned to a court or to a meeting or to his relatives presence or to his guild or to the royal family s presence and questioned as a witness thus so good man tell what you know not knowing he says i do not know or knowing he says i know not seeing he says i do not see or seeing he says i see he does not in full awareness speak falsehood for his own ends or for another s ends or for some trifling worldly end abandoning malicious speech he becomes one who abstains from malicious speech as one who is neither a repeater elsewhere of what is heard here for the purpose of causing division from these nor a repeater to these of what is heard elsewhere for the purpose of causing division from those who is thus a reuniter of the divided a promoter of friendships enjoying concord rejoicing in concord delighting in concord he becomes a speaker of words that promote concord abandoning harsh speech he becomes one who abstains from harsh speech he becomes a speaker of such words as are innocent pleasing to the ear and lovable as go to the heart are civil desired of many and dear to many abandoning gossip he becomes one who abstains from gossip as one who tells that which is seasonable that which is factual that which is good that which is the dhamma that which is the discipline he speaks in season speech worth recording which is reasoned definite and connected with good that is how there are four kinds of verbal conduct in accordance with the dhamma righteous conduct and how are there three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the dhamma righteous conduct here someone is not covetous he is not a coveter of another s chattels and property thus oh that what is another s were mine he has no mind of ill will with the intention of a mind unaffected by hate thus may these beings be free from enmity affliction and anxiety may they live happily he has right view undistorted vision thus there is what is given and what is offered and what is sacrificed and there is fruit and ripening of good and bad kammas and there is this world and the other world and mother and father and spontaneously born beings and good and virtuous monks and brahmans that have themselves realized by direct knowledge and declared this world and the other world that is how there are three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the dhamma righteous conduct so householders it is by reason of conduct in accordance with the dhamma by reason of righteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world if a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the dhamma righteous conduct should wish oh that on the dissolution of the body after death i might reappear in the company of the warrior nobles of great property it is possible that on the dissolution of the body after death he may do so why is that because he observes conduct that is in accordance with the dhamma righteous conduct if a householder who observes conduct is accordance with the dhamma righteous conduct should wish oh that on the dissolution of the body after death i might reappear in the company of the brahmans of great property it is possible if a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the dhamma i might reappear in the company of householders of great property it is possible if a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the dhamma righteous conduct should wish oh that on the dissolution of the body after death i might reappear in the company of the gods of the four kings it is possible that on the dissolution of the body after death he may do so why is that because he observes conduct in accordance with the dhamma righteous conduct of the gods of the realm of the thirty three if a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the dhamma righteous conduct should wish oh that on the dissolution of the body after death i might reappear in the company of the gods of the base consisting of neither perception nor non perception it is possible that on the dissolution of the body after death he may do so why is that because he observes conduct in accordance with the dhamma righteous conduct if a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the dhamma righteous conduct should wish oh that by realization myself with direct knowledge i may here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of the heart and the deliverance by wisdom that are taint free with exhaustion of taints it is possible that by realization himself with direct knowledge he may here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of the heart and the deliverance by wisdom that are taint free with exhaustion of taints why is that because he observes conduct in accordance with the dhamma righteous conduct when this was said the brahman householders of sala said to the blessed one we go to master gotama for refuge and to the dhamma and to the sangha of bhikkhus from today let master gotama accept us as followers who have gone to him for refuge for life on one occasion the householder anathapindika was afflicted suffering and gravely ill the venerable sariputta dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went to the residence of anathapindika with ananda as his attendant having gone there he sat down on a seat made ready and said to anathapindika i hope you are getting well i hope you are comfortable i hope your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing venerable sariputta i am not getting well i am not comfortable my painful feelings are increasing not subsiding just as if a strong man were splitting my head open with a sharp sword so too violent winds cut through my head just as if a strong man were tightening a tough leather strap around my head as a headband so too there are violent pains in my head just as if a skilled butcher or his apprentice were to carve up an ox s belly with a sharp butcher s knife so too violent winds are carving up my belly just as if two strong men were to seize a weaker man by both arms and roast him over a pit of hot coals so too there is a violent burning in my body i am not getting well i am not comfortable my painful feelings are increasing not subsiding then householder said sariputta you should train thus when this was said anathapindika wept and shed tears then ananda asked him are you foundering householder are you sinking i am not foundering ananda i am not sinking but although i have long waited upon the teacher and bhikkhus worthy of esteem never before have i heard such a talk on the dhamma such talk on the dhamma is not given to lay people clothed in white but only to those who have gone forth well then sariputta let such talk on the dhamma be given to lay people clothed in white there are people with little dust in their eyes who are wasting away through not hearing such talk on the dhamma there will be those who will understand then after giving anathapindika this advice sariputta and ananda rose from their seats and departed soon after they had left the householder anathapindika died and reappeared in the tushita heaven men of integrity have been attended to the dhamma repeatedly listened to having listened i followed the straight way coming ashore in the deathless passion for becoming having been killed by me no further such passion is found in me it neither was nor will be nor is found in me even now i have heard that at one time the blessed one was staying in there he addressed the monks saying monks yes lord the monks responded to him the blessed one said i will teach analyze for you the noble eightfold path listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded to him the blessed one said now what monks is the noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration and what monks is right view knowledge with regard to stress knowledge with regard to the origination of stress knowledge with regard to the stopping of stress knowledge with regard to the way of practice leading to the stopping of stress this monks is called right view and what is right resolve being resolved on renunciation on freedom from ill will on harmlessness this is called right resolve and what is right speech abstaining from lying abstaining from divisive speech abstaining from abusive speech abstaining from idle chatter this monks is called right speech and what monks is right action abstaining from taking life abstaining from stealing abstaining from unchastity this monks is called right action and what monks is right livelihood there is the case where a disciple of the noble ones having abandoned dishonest livelihood keeps his life going with right livelihood this monks is called right livelihood and what monks is right effort and what monks is right mindfulness and what monks is right concentration that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted at his words to me resolute in exertion near the river nera jara making a great effort doing jhana to attain rest from the yoke namuci doi i will smashmara i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near savatthi at jeta s grove anathapindika s monastery then the blessed one picking up a little bit of dust with the tip of his fingernail said to the monks what do you think monks which is greater the little bit of dust i have picked up with the tip of my fingernail or the great earth the great earth is far greater lord the little bit of dust the blessed one has picked up with the tip of his fingernail is next to nothing it s not a hundredth a thousandth a one hundred thousandth this little bit of dust the blessed one has picked up with the tip of his fingernail when compared with the great earth what needs to be done with firm persistence what needs to be done by someone who hopes for awakening that i will do i will not fail see persistence striving you show me the path straight coming ashore in the deathless i through sagacity will reach it know it as the stream of the ganges like a fishhard to hold down so hard to see wandering far once a hawk suddenly swooped down on a quail and seized it then the quail as it was being carried off by the hawk lamented o just my bad luck and lack of merit that i was wandering out of my proper range and into the territory of others if only i had kept to my proper range today to my own ancestral territory this hawk would have been no match for me in battle but what is your proper range the hawk asked what is your own ancestral territory a newly plowed field with clumps of earth all turned up so the hawk without bragging about its own strength without mentioning its own strength let go of the quail go quail but even when you have gone there you won t escape me then the quail having gone to a newly plowed field with clumps of earth all turned up and climbing up on top of a large clump of earth stood taunting the hawk now come and get me you hawk now come and get me you hawk so the hawk without bragging about its own strength without mentioning its own strength folded its two wings and suddenly swooped down toward the quail when the quail knew the hawk is coming at me full speed it slipped behind the clump of earth and right there the hawk shattered its own breast this is what happens to anyone who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of others for this reason you should not wander into what is not your proper range and is the territory of others in one who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of others wander monks in what is your proper range your own ancestral territory in one who wanders in what is his proper range his own ancestral territory mara gains no opening mara gains no foothold and what for a monk is his proper range his own ancestral territory monks these four goodly thoroughbred steeds are found existing in the world what four in this case monks we may have a certain goodly thoroughbred steed which at the very sight of the shadow of the goad stick is stirred feels agitation thinking what task i wonder will the trainer set me today what return can i make him here monks we may have such a steed and this is the first sort of goodly thoroughbred steed found existing in the world then again monks we may have a certain goodly thoroughbred steed which is not stirred at the mere sight of the goad stick s shadow feels no agitation but when his coat is pricked with the goad he is stirred feels agitation thinking what task i wonder this is the second sort then again monks we may have a certain goodly thoroughbred steed which is not stirred at the sight of the goad stick s shade nor yet when his coat is pricked with the goad but when his flesh is pierced he is stirred he feels agitated thinking what task i wonder this is the third sort once more monks we may have a goodly thoroughbred steed which is stirred neither at the sight of the goad stick s shade nor when his coat is pricked nor yet when his flesh is pierced by the goad stick but when he is pierced to the very bone he is stirred feels agitation thinking what task i wonder will the trainer set me today what return can i make him here we have such a goodly thoroughbred steed this is the fourth sort thus monks there four goodly thoroughbred steeds are found existing in the world just in the same way monks these four goodly thoroughbred men are found existing in the world what four in this case monks we may have a certain goodly thoroughbred man who hears is said that in such and such a village or township is a woman or man afflicted or dead thereat he is stirred he feels agitation thus agitated he strictly applied himself thus applied he both realized in his own person the supreme truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdom just as monks that goodly thoroughbred steed on seeing the shadow of the goad stick is stirred feels agitation even so using this figure do i speak of this goodly thoroughbred man such in this case is the goodly thoroughbred man this is the first sort again monks here we may have a goodly thoroughbred man who does not hear it said that in such a village or township is a woman or a man afflicted or dead but with his own eyes beholds such thereupon he is stirred he feels agitation then again monks here we may have a goodly thoroughbred man who does not hear it said nor yet with his own eyes beholds a woman or a man afflicted or dead but his own kinsman or blood relation is afflicted or dead thereupon he is stirred just as monks that goodly thoroughbred steed on having his flesh pierced is stirred even so using this figure do i speak of this goodly thoroughbred man such in this case this is the third sort once more monks here we may have a goodly thoroughbred man who neither hears it said nor yet with his own eyes beholds nor is his own kinsman or blood relation afflicted or dead but he himself is stricken with painful bodily feelings grievous sharp racking distracting discomforting that drain the life away thereat he is stirred he feels agitation being so stirred he strictly applied himself thus applied he both realizes in his own person the supreme truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdom just as monks that goodly thoroughbred steed on being pierced to the very bone is stirred feels agitation even so using this figure do i speak of this goodly thoroughbred man of such a sort monks is the goodly thoroughbred man in this case this is the fourth sort these monks are the four sorts of thoroughbreds among men found existing in the world i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near savatthi in jeta s grove anathapindika s monastery there he addressed the monks monks yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said develop concentration monks a concentrated monk discerns in line with what has come into being and what does he discern in line with what has come into being the origination disappearance of form the origination disappearance of feeling perception fabrications the origination disappearance of consciousness and what is the origination of form feeling perception fabrications what is the origination of consciousness there is the case where one enjoys welcomes remains fastened and what does one enjoy welcome to what does one remain fastened one enjoys welcomes remains fastened to form as one enjoys welcomes remains fastened to form there arises delight any delight in form is clinging from clinging sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth from birth as a requisite condition then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair come into play such is the origination of this entire mass of stress suffering one enjoys welcomes remains fastened to feeling perception fabrications one enjoys welcomes remains fastened to consciousness as one enjoys welcomes remains fastened to consciousness there arises delight any delight in consciousness is clinging from clinging sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth from birth as a requisite condition then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair come into play such is the origination of this entire mass of stress suffering this monks is the origination of form this the origination of feeling perception fabrications this the origination of consciousness and what is the disappearance of form feeling perception fabrications what is the disappearance of consciousness there is the case where one doesn t enjoy welcome or remain fastened and what does one not enjoy or welcome to what does one not remain fastened one doesn t enjoy welcome or remain fastened to form as one doesn t enjoy welcome or remain fastened to form any delight in form ceases from the cessation of delight comes the cessation of clinging from the cessation of clinging sustenance the cessation of becoming from the cessation of becoming the cessation of birth from the cessation of birth then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair all cease such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress suffering one doesn t enjoy welcome or remain fastened to feeling perception fabrications one doesn t enjoy welcome or remain fastened to consciousness as one doesn t enjoy welcome or remain fastened to consciousness any delight in consciousness ceases from the cessation of delight comes the cessation of clinging from the cessation of clinging sustenance the cessation of becoming from the cessation of becoming the cessation of birth from the cessation of birth then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair all cease such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress suffering this monks is the disappearance of form this the disappearance of feeling perception fabrications this the disappearance of consciousness thus have i heard once the blessed one was staying at then one evening the venerable venerable sir there are these various views that arise in the world concerning self doctrines or world doctrines cunda as to those several views that arise in the world concerning self doctrines and world doctrines if the object in whichthe eight attainments it may be cunda that some monk detached from sense objects detached from unsalutary ideas enters into the first absorption that is born of detachment accompanied by thought conception and discursive thinking and filled with rapture and joy and he then might think i am abiding in effacement but in the noble one s discipline it is not these attainments that are called effacement in the noble one s discipline they are called abidings in ease here and now it may be that after the stilling of thought conception and discursive thinking he gains the inner tranquillity and harmony of the second absorption that is free of thought conception and discursive thinking born of concentration and filled with rapture and joy and he then might think i am abiding in effacement but in the noble one s discipline it is not these attainments that are called effacement in the noble one s discipline they are called abidings in ease here and now it may be that after the fading away of rapture the monk dwells in equanimity mindful and clearly aware and he experiences a happiness in his body of which the noble ones say happily lives he who dwells in equanimity and is mindful that third absorption he wins and he then might think i am abiding in effacement but in the noble one s discipline it is not these attainments that are called effacement in the noble one s discipline they are called abidings in ease here and now it may be that with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief he enters upon and abides in the fourth absorption which is beyond pleasure and pain and has purity of mindfulness due to equanimity and he then might think i am abiding in effacement but in the noble one s discipline it is not these attainments that are called effacement in the noble one s discipline they are called abidings in ease here and now it may be that with the entire transcending of perceptions of corporeality it may be that by entirely transcending the sphere of infinite space thinking consciousness is infinite some monk enters and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness and he then might think i am abiding in effacement but in the noble one s discipline it is not these attainments that are called effacement in the noble one s discipline they are called peaceful abidings it may be that by entirely transcending the sphere of infinite consciousness some monk enters and abides in the sphere of nothingness and he then might think i am abiding in effacement but in the noble one s discipline it is not these attainments that are called effacement in the noble one s discipline they are called peaceful abidings it may be that by entirely transcending the sphere of nothingness some monk enters and abides in the sphere of neither perception nor non perception and he then might think i am abiding in effacement but in the noble one s discipline it is not these attainments that are called effacement in the noble one s discipline they are called peaceful abidings effacement but herein cunda effacement should be practiced by you the arising of thought cunda i say that even the arising of a thought concerned with salutary things and ideas avoidance suppose cunda there were an uneven road and another even road by which to avoid it and suppose there were an uneven ford and another even ford by which to avoid it the way upward cunda as all unsalutary states lead downward and all salutary states lead upward even so cunda quenching it is not possible cunda that one who is himself not restrained not disciplined and not quenched as to his passions conclusion thus cunda i have shown to you the instruction on effacement i have shown to you the instruction on thought s arising i have shown to you the instruction on avoidance i have shown to you the instruction on the way upward i have shown to you the instruction on quenching what can be done for his disciples by a master who seeks their welfare and has compassion and pity on them that i have done for you cunda thus spoke the blessed one satisfied the venerable cunda rejoiced in the blessed one s words the concluding verse added by the theras of the first council deep like the ocean is this suttanta on effacement dealing with forty four items showing them in five sections i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was living among the the sort of doctrine friend where one does not keep quarreling with anyone in the cosmos with its devas maras brahmas with its contemplatives brahmans its royalty commonfolk the sort of doctrine where perceptions no longer obsess the brahman who remains dissociated from sensuality free from perplexity his uncertainty cut away devoid of craving for becoming non such is my doctrine such is what i proclaim when this was said dandapani the sakyan shaking his head wagging his tongue raising his eyebrows so that his forehead was wrinkled in three furrows left leaning on his stick then when it was evening the blessed one rose from his seclusion and went to the banyan park on arrival he sat down on a seat made ready as he was sitting there he told the monks what had happened when this was said a certain monk said to the blessed one lord what sort of doctrine is it where one does not keep quarreling with anyone in the cosmos with its deities maras brahmas with its contemplatives brahmans its royalty commonfolk where perceptions no longer obsess the brahman who remains dissociated from sensuality free from perplexity his uncertainty cut away devoid of craving for becoming non if monk with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions categories of objectification assail a person there is nothing there to relish welcome or remain fastened to then that is the end of the obsessions of passion the obsessions of resistance the obsessions of views the obsessions of uncertainty the obsessions of conceit the obsessions of passion for becoming the obsessions of ignorance that is the end of taking up rods bladed weapons of arguments quarrels disputes accusations divisive tale bearing false speech that is where these evil unskillful things cease without remainder that is what the blessed one said having said it the one well gone got up from his seat and went into his dwelling then not long after the blessed one had left this thought occurred to the monks this brief statement the blessed one made after which he went into his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning i e if with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions categories of objectification assail a person there is nothing to relish that is where these evil unskillful things cease without remainder now who might analyze the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement then the thought occurred to them so the monks went to ven maha kaccana and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies they sat to one side as they were sitting there they told him what had happened and added analyze the meaning ven maha kaccana he replied friends yes friend kaccana knowing the blessed one knows seeing he sees he is the eye he is knowledge he is dhamma he is brahma he is the speaker the proclaimer the elucidator of meaning the giver of the deathless the lord of the dhamma the tathagata that was the time when we should have questioned him about this matter however he answered that was how we should have remembered it but you are praised by the teacher and esteemed by your knowledgeable companions in the holy life you are capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement analyze the meaning ven maha kaccana without making it difficult in that case my friends listen pay close attention i will speak as you say friend the monks responded ven maha kaccayana said this friends concerning the brief statement the blessed one made after which he went into his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning i e if with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions categories of objectification assail a person there is nothing there to relish welcome or remain fastened to then that is the end of the obsessions of passion the obsessions of resistance the obsessions of views the obsessions of uncertainty the obsessions of conceit the obsessions of passion for becoming the obsessions of ignorance that is the end of taking up rods bladed weapons of arguments quarrels disputes accusations divisive tale bearing false speech that is

categories of objectification so concerning the brief statement the blessed one made after which he entered his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning i e if with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions categories of objectification assail a person there is nothing there to relish welcome or remain fastened to then that is the end of the obsessions of passion the obsessions of resistance the obsessions of views the obsessions of uncertainty the obsessions of conceit the obsessions of passion for becoming the obsessions of ignorance that is the end of taking up rods bladed weapons of arguments quarrels disputes accusations divisive tale bearing false speech that is where these evil unskillful things cease without remainder this is how i understand the detailed meaning now friends if you wish having gone to the blessed one question him about this matter however he answers is how you should remember it then the monks delighting in approving of ven maha kaccana s words got up from their seats and went to the blessed one on arrival having bowed down to him they sat to one side as they were sitting there they told him what had happened after he had gone into his dwelling and ended by saying then ven maha kaccana analyzed the meaning using these words statements phrases maha kaccana is wise monks he is a person of great discernment if you had asked me about this matter i too would have answered in the same way he did that is its meaning and that is how you should remember it when this was said then ananda you can remember this dhamma discourse as the ball of honey discourse that is what the blessed one said gratified ven ananda delighted in the blessed one s words monks these four kinds of persons are to be found existing in the world which four one who is engaged in promoting neither his own good nor in promoting the good of another one who is engaged in promoting another s good but not in promoting his own good one who is engaged in promoting his own good but not in promoting the good of another and one who is engaged in promoting his own good and also in promoting the good of another just as monks a piece of wood from a pyre burnt at both ends and in the middle fouled with dung serves neither for fuel in the village nor for timber in the forest so in the same way monks is such a person i say who is engaged in promoting neither his own good nor in promoting the good of another monks there is the person who is engaged in promoting the good of another but not in promoting his own good of these two individuals the latter is superior monks there is the person who is engaged in promoting his own good but not in promoting the good of another of these three individuals he is superior monks there is the person who is engaged in promoting his own good and also in promoting another s good of these four individuals he is the foremost the chief the principal the best and the supreme just as monks from a cow comes milk from milk curd from curd butter from butter ghee from ghee the skimmings of ghee and that is reckoned the best even so monks among these four individuals the person who is engaged in promoting his own good and also the good of another is the foremost the chief the principal the best and the supreme monks these are the four individuals who are to be found existing in the world i have heard

to be understood those here who have fathomed the dhamma those who are learners those who are run of the mill when you dear sir astute are asked this tell me their manner of life these four types of individuals are to be found existing in the world which four the individual who goes with the flow the individual who goes against the flow the individual who stands fast and the one who has crossed over gone beyond who stands on firm ground a brahman and who is the individual who goes with the flow there is the case where an individual indulges in sensual passions and does evil deeds this is called the individual who goes with the flow and who is the individual who goes against the flow there is the case where an individual doesn t indulge in sensual passions and doesn t do evil deeds even though it may be with pain even though it may be with sorrow even though he may be crying his face in tears he lives the holy life that is perfect pure this is called the individual who goes against the flow and who is the individual who stands fast there is the case where an individual with the total ending of the first set of five fetters is due to be reborn in the pure abodes there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world this is called the individual who stands fast and who is the individual who has crossed over gone beyond who stands on firm ground a brahman there is the case where an individual through the ending of the mental fermentations enters remains in the fermentation free awareness release discernment release having known made them manifest for himself right in the here now this is called the individual who has crossed over gone beyond who stands on firm ground a brahman these are the four types of individuals to be found existing in the world people unrestrained in sensual passions not devoid of passion indulging in sensuality they return to birth aging again again seized by craving going with the flow thus the enlightened one with mindfulness here established not indulging in sensuality evil though it may be with pain would abandon sensuality they call him one who goes against the flow whoever having abandoned the five defilements is perfect in training not destined to fall back skilled in awareness with faculties composed he s called one who stands fast in one who having known qualities high low have been destroyed have gone to their end do not exist he s called a master of knowledge one who has fulfilled the holy life gone to the world s end gone beyond this is what i heard on one occasion the buddhaat that time a young householder named sigalaka arose early and set out from rajagaha with freshly washed clothes and hair meanwhile the buddha dressed himself in the early morning took his bowl and robe and went in to rajagaha on alms round on the way he saw sigalaka worshipping the six directions seeing this the buddha said to him young man why have you risen in the early morning and set out from rajagaha to worship in such a way dear sir my father on his deathbed urged me my son you must worship the directions so dear sir realizing honoring respecting and holding sacred my father s request i have risen in the early morning and set out from rajagaha to worship in this way but young man that is not how the six directions should be worshipped according to the discipline of the noble ones then how dear sir should the six directions be worshipped according to the discipline of the noble ones i would appreciate it if you would teach me the proper way this should be done very well young man listen and pay careful attention while i tell you yes dear sir agreed sigalaka the buddha said this young man by abandoning the four impure actions a noble disciple refrains from harmful deeds rooted in four causes and avoids the six ways of squandering wealth so these fourteen harmful things are removed the noble disciple now with the six directions protected has entered upon a path for conquering both worlds firmly grounded in this world and the next at the dissolution of the body after death a good rebirth occurs in a heavenly world what four impure actions are abandoned the harming of living beings is an impure action taking what is not given is an impure action sexual misconduct is an impure action and false speech is an impure action that is what the buddha said summing up in verse the sublime teacher said harming living beings taking what is not given false speech and pursuing the loved one of another these the wise surely do not praise what are the four causes of harmful deeds going astray through desire hatred delusion or fear the noble disciple does harmful deeds but young man not going astray through desire hatred delusion or fear the noble disciple does not perform harmful deeds that is what the buddha said summing up in verse the sublime teacher said desire hatred delusion or fear whoever transgresses the dhamma by these has a reputation that comes to ruin like the moon in the waning fortnight desire hatred delusion or fear whoever transgresses not the dhamma by these has a reputation that comes to fullness like the moon in the waxing fortnight and what six ways of squandering wealth are to be avoided young man heedlessness caused by intoxication roaming the streets at inappropriate times habitual partying compulsive gambling bad companionship and laziness are the six ways of squandering wealth these are the six dangers inherent in heedlessness caused by intoxication loss of immediate wealth increased quarreling susceptibility to illness disrepute indecent exposure and weakened insight these are the six dangers inherent in roaming the streets at inappropriate times oneself one s family and one s property are all left unguarded and unprotected one is suspected of crimes then rumors spread and one is subjected to many miseries these are the six dangers inherent in habitual partying you constantly seek where s the dancing where s the singing where s the music where are the stories where s the applause where s the drumming these are the six dangers inherent in compulsive gambling winning breeds resentment the loser mourns lost property savings are lost one s word carries no weight in a public forum friends and colleagues display their contempt and one is not sought after for marriage since a gambler cannot adequately support a family these are the six dangers inherent in bad companionship any rogue drunkard addict cheat swindler or thug becomes a friend and colleague these are the six dangers inherent in laziness saying it s too cold one does not work saying it s too hot one does not work saying it s too late one does not work saying it s too early one does not work saying i m too hungry one does not work saying i m too full one does not work with an abundance of excuses for not working new wealth does not accrue and existing wealth goes to waste that is what the buddha said summing up in verse the sublime teacher said some are drinking buddies some say dear friend dear friend but whoever in hardship stands close by that one truly is a friend sleeping late adultery hostility meaninglessness harmful friends utter stinginess these six things destroy a person bad friends bad companions bad practices spending time in evil ways by these one brings oneself to ruin in this world and the next seduction gambling drinking singing dancing sleeping by day wandering all around untimely harmful friends utter stinginess these things destroy a person they play with dice they drink spirits they consort with lovers dear to others associating with low life and not the esteemed they come to ruin like the waning moon whoever is a drunkard broke and destitute dragged by thirst from bar to bar sinking into debt like a stone in water into bewilderment quickly plunges when sleeping late becomes a habit and night is seen as time to rise for one perpetually intoxicated a home life cannot be maintained too cold too hot too late they say having wasted work time this way the young miss out on opportunities for one regarding cold and hot as not more than blades of grass doing whatever should be done happiness will not be a stranger young man be aware of these four enemies disguised as friends the taker the talker the flatterer and the reckless companion the taker can be identified by four things by only taking asking for a lot while giving little performing duty out of fear and offering service in order to gain something the talker can be identified by four things by reminding of past generosity promising future generosity mouthing empty words of kindness and protesting personal misfortune when called on to help the flatterer can be identified by four things by supporting both bad and good behavior indiscriminately praising you to your face and putting you down behind your back the reckless companion can be identified by four things by accompanying you in drinking roaming around at night partying and gambling that is what the buddha said summing up in verse the sublime teacher said the friend who is all take the friend of empty words the friend full of flattery and the reckless friend these four are not friends but enemies the wise understand this and keep them at a distance as they would a dangerous path young man be aware of these four good hearted friends the helper the friend who endures in good times and bad the mentor and the compassionate friend the helper can be identified by four things by protecting you when you are vulnerable and likewise your wealth being a refuge when you are afraid and in various tasks providing double what is requested the enduring friend can be identified by four things by telling you secrets guarding your own secrets closely not abandoning you in misfortune and even dying for you the mentor can be identified by four things by restraining you from wrongdoing guiding you towards good actions telling you what you ought to know and showing you the path to heaven the compassionate friend can be identified by four things by not rejoicing in your misfortune delighting in your good fortune preventing others from speaking ill of you and encouraging others who praise your good qualities that is what the buddha said summing up in verse the sublime teacher said the friend who is a helper the friend through thick and thin the friend who gives good counsel and the compassionate friend these four are friends indeed the wise understand this and attend on them carefully like a mother her own child the wise endowed with virtue shine forth like a burning fire gathering wealth as bees do honey and heaping it up like an ant hill once wealth is accumulated family and household life may follow by dividing wealth into four parts true friendships are bound one part should be enjoyed two parts invested in business and the fourth set aside against future misfortunes and how young man does the noble disciple protect the six directions these six directions should be known mother and father as the east teachers as the south spouse and family as the west friends and colleagues as the north workers and servants as the lower direction and ascetics and brahmans as the upper direction in five ways should a mother and father as the eastern direction be respected by a child i will support them who supported me i will do my duty to them i will maintain the family lineage and tradition i will be worthy of my inheritance and i will make donations on behalf of dead ancestors and the mother and father so respected reciprocate with compassion in five ways by restraining you from wrongdoing guiding you towards good actions training you in a profession supporting the choice of a suitable spouse and in due time handing over the inheritance in this way the eastern direction is protected and made peaceful and secure in five ways should teachers as the southern direction be respected by a student by rising for them regularly attending lessons eagerly desiring to learn duly serving them and receiving instruction and teachers so respected reciprocate with compassion in five ways by training in self discipline ensuring the teachings are well grasped instructing in every branch of knowledge introducing their friends and colleagues and providing safeguards in every direction in this way the southern direction is protected and made peaceful and secure in five ways should a wife as the western direction be respected by a husband by honoring not disrespecting being faithful sharing authority and by giving gifts and the wife so respected reciprocates with compassion in five ways by being well organized being kindly disposed to the in laws and household workers being faithful looking after the household goods and being skillful and diligent in all duties in this way the western direction is protected and made peaceful and secure in five ways should friends and colleagues as the northern direction be respected by generosity kind words acting for their welfare impartiality and honesty and friends and colleagues so respected reciprocate with compassion in five ways by protecting you when you are vulnerable and likewise your wealth being a refuge when you are afraid not abandoning you in misfortunes and honoring all your descendants in this way the northern direction is protected and made peaceful and secure and workers and servants so respected reciprocate with compassion in five ways being willing to start early and finish late when necessary taking only what is given doing work well and promoting a good reputation in this way the lower direction is protected and made peaceful and secure in five ways should ascetics and brahmans as the upper direction be respected by kindly actions speech and thoughts having an open door and providing material needs and ascetics and brahmans so respected reciprocate with compassion in six ways by restraining you from wrongdoing guiding you to good actions thinking compassionately telling you what you ought to know clarifying what you already know and showing you the path to heaven in this way the upper direction is protected and made peaceful and secure that is what the buddha said summing up in verse the sublime teacher said mother and father as the east teachers as the south spouse and family as the west friends and colleagues as the north servants and workers below brahmans and ascetics above these directions a person should honor in order to be truly good wise and virtuous gentle and eloquent humble and accommodating such a person attains glory energetic not lazy not shaken in misfortune flawless in conduct and intelligent such a person attains glory a compassionate maker of friends approachable free from stinginess a leader a teacher and diplomat such a person attains glory generosity and kind words conduct for others welfare impartiality in all things these are suitable everywhere these kind dispositions hold the world together like the linchpin of a moving chariot and should these kind dispositions not exist then the mother would not receive respect or honor from her child neither would a father upon these things the wise reflect they obtain greatness and are sources of praise when all was said the young householder sigalaka exclaimed to the buddha wonderful dear sir wonderful it is as though you have set upright what was overturned or uncovered what was concealed or shown the path to one gone astray or brought an oil lamp into the darkness such that those with eyes could see so too has the buddha made clear the dhamma by various ways i go for refuge to the buddha and to the dhamma and to the monastic community i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at just form o blessed one just form o one well gone form rahula feeling perception fabrications consciousness then the thought occurred to ven rahula who having been exhorted face to face by the blessed one would go into the town for alms today so he turned back and sat down at the foot of a tree folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect setting mindfulness to the fore ven sariputta saw ven rahula sitting at the foot of a tree his legs folded crosswise his body held erect with mindfulness set to the fore on seeing him he said to him rahula develop the meditationthen ven rahula emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the blessed one and having bowed down sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to him how lord is

mindfulness of in out breathing mindfulness of in out breathing when developed pursued is of great fruit of great benefit and how rahula is mindfulness of in out breathing developed pursued so as to

erect and setting mindfulness to the fore breathing in long he discerns i am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns i am breathing out long or breathing in short he discerns i am

when mindfulness of in out breathing is developed pursued in this way even one s final in breaths out breaths are known as they cease not unknown that is what the blessed one said gratified ven rahula delighted in the blessed one s words eye ear nose tongue body mind when a monk leaves these doors unguarded knowing no moderation in food not restraining his senses he experiences stress stress in body stress in mind burning in body burning in mind whether by day or by night he lives in suffering stress i have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling among the then the devata inhabiting the forest thicket feeling sympathy for the monk desiring his benefit desiring to bring him to his senses approached him and addressed him with this verse you sniff this water born flower that hasn t been given to you this dear sir is a factor of stealing you are a thief of a scent the monk chastened by the devata came to his senses the monk the devata the monk the devata then enough headman put that aside don t ask me that a second time a third time yodhajiva the headman said lord i have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of warriors that when a warrior strives exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down slay him while he is striving exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle what does the blessed one have to say about that apparently headman i haven t been able to get past you by saying enough headman put that aside don t ask me that so i will simply answer you when a warrior strives exerts himself in battle his mind is already seized debased misdirected by the thought may these beings be struck down or slaughtered or annihilated or destroyed may they not exist if others then strike him down slay him while he is thus striving exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the hell called the realm of those slain in battle but if he holds such a view as this when a warrior strives exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down slay him while he is striving exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle that is his wrong view now there are two destinations for a person with wrong view i tell you either hell or the animal womb when this was said yodhajiva the headman sobbed burst into tears the blessed one said that is what i couldn t get past you by saying enough headman put that aside don t ask me that i m not crying lord because of what the blessed one said to me but simply because i have been deceived cheated fooled for a long time by that ancient teaching lineage of warriors who said when a warrior strives exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down slay him while he is striving exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle mettagu the buddha mettagu the buddha mettagu the buddha mine mettagu the buddha before i had fallen on evil times no husband no children no relatives friends no way to obtain clothing food so taking a staff bowl in hand begging for alms from house to house feverish from the cold heat i wandered for seven full years then seeing a nun obtaining food drink i approached her said let me go forth into homelessness she patacarastaying at savatthi then king ajatasattu of magadha the son of queen videha raising a fourfold army marched toward the thought then occurred to king pasenadi even though king ajatasattu has wronged me when i have done him no wrong still he is my nephew what if i having confiscated all his elephant troops all his cavalry all his chariots all his infantry were to let him go with just his life so king pasenadi having confiscated all his elephant troops cavalry chariots infantry let king ajatasattu go with just his life then in the early morning a large number of monks having put on their robes and carrying their bowls outer robes went into savatthi for alms having gone for alms in savatthi after the meal returning from their alms round they went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they reported these events to the blessed one then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion spoke these verses a man may plunder as long as it serves his ends but when others are plundered he who has plundered gets plundered in turn a fool thinks now s my chance as long as his evil has yet to ripen but when it ripens the fool falls into pain killing you gain your killer conquering you gain one who will conquer you insulting insult harassing harassment and so through the cycle of action he who has plundered gets plundered in turn angulimala i the buddha angulimala on one occasion the blessed one was staying near so the monks went to the park of the wanderers of other sects on arrival they exchanged courteous greetings with the wanderers of other sects after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies they sat to one side as they were sitting there the wanderers of other sects said to them friends gotama the contemplative teaches the dhamma to his disciples in this way come monks abandoning the five hindrances the corruptions of awareness that weaken discernment develop the seven factors for awakening as they have come to be now friends we too teach our disciples in this way come you friends abandoning the five hindrances the corruptions of awareness that weaken discernment develop the seven factors for awakening as they have come to be so friends what difference what distinction what distinguishing factor is there here between gotama the contemplative and us when comparing dhamma teaching with dhamma teaching instruction with instruction then the monks neither delighted in the words of the wanderers of other sects nor did they reject them without delighting or rejecting they got up from their seats and left thinking we will learn the meaning of these words in the presence of the blessed one so having gone for alms in savatthi after the meal returning from their alms round the monks went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they told him what had happened monks when wanderers of other sects speak in that way they should be addressed in this way friends on any occasion when the mind is sluggish which of the factors of awakening is that the wrong time to develop which of the factors of awakening is that the right time to develop and on any occasion when the mind is restless which of the factors of awakening is that the wrong time to develop which of the factors of awakening is that the right time to develop being asked in this way the wanderers of other sects will be unable to respond and on top of that will fall into vexation why is that because it lies beyond their range monks i don t see anyone in this cosmos with its devas maras and brahmas with its people with their contemplatives brahmans their royalty commonfolk who would satisfy the mind with their answer to these questions aside from the tathagata a disciple of the tathagata or one who had heard it from them no lord in the same way monks on any occasion the mind is sluggish that is the wrong time to develop calm as a factor for awakening concentration as a factor for awakening equanimity as a factor for awakening why is that the sluggish mind is hard to raise up by those mental qualities now on any occasion when the mind is sluggish that is the right time to develop analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening persistence as a factor for awakening rapture as a factor for awakening why is that the sluggish mind is easy to raise up by those mental qualities yes lord in the same way monks on any occasion when the mind is sluggish that is the right time to develop analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening persistence as a factor for awakening rapture as a factor for awakening why is that the sluggish mind is easy to raise up by those mental qualities no lord in the same way monks on any occasion when the mind is restless that is the wrong time to develop analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening persistence as a factor for awakening rapture as a factor for awakening why is that the restless mind is hard to still with those mental qualities now on occasions when the mind is restless that is the right time to develop calm as a factor for awakening concentration as a factor for awakening equanimity as a factor for awakening why is that the restless mind is easy to still with those mental qualities yes lord in the same way monks when the mind is restless that is the right time to develop calm as a factor for awakening concentration as a factor for awakening equanimity as a factor for awakening why is that the restless mind is easy to still with those mental qualities as for mindfulness i tell you that serves every purpose but so na whatever recluses and brahmans do not hold such views what else are they but those who see things as they really are this monks is the meanest so monks a young man of good family leaves the world but he is greedy for sense pleasures with fierce passions with hate in his heart corruptly motivated indeed monks this concentration on the signless is greatly to be commended the concentration on the signless if developed and frequently practiced is of great fruit of great profit there are monks these two views the existence view and the non existence view and the well taught ariyan disciple deliberates is there anything in the world that i can cling to without being at fault and he realizes there is nothing in the world that i can cling to without being at fault suppose i were to grasp and cling to the body to feelings perceptions the mental formations consciousness conditioned by my clinging becoming would arise conditioned by becoming birth conditioned by birth decay and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair in that way the whole mass of suffering would arise monks there are these there is the case where an individual keeps pervading the first direction again there is the case where an individual keeps pervading the first direction as well as the second direction the third the fourth with an awareness imbued with compassion appreciation equanimity thus he keeps pervading above below all around everywhere in every respect the all encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with equanimity abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will he regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness not self at the break up of the body after death he reappears in conjunction with the devas of the pure abodes this rebirth is not in common with run of the mill people these are four types of individuals to be found existing in the world i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near varanasi in the game refuge at isipatana there he addressed the monks monks yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said monks at varanasi in the game refuge at isipatana the tathagatha the worthy one the rightly self awakened one set in motion the unexcelled wheel of dhamma that cannot be stopped by brahman or contemplative deity mara or brahma or anyone at all in the cosmos in other words the declaration teaching description setting forth revelation explanation and making plain of the four noble truths of which four the declaration teaching description setting forth revelation explanation and making plain of the noble truth of stress the declaration teaching description setting forth revelation explanation and making plain of the noble truth of the origination of stress the noble truth of the cessation of stress the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress at varanasi in the game refuge at isipatana the tathagatha the worthy one the rightly self awakened one set in motion the unexcelled wheel of dhamma that cannot be stopped by brahman or contemplative deity mara or brahma or anyone at all in the cosmos in other words the declaration teaching description setting forth revelation explanation and making plain of these four noble truths monks associate with sariputta moggallana consort with sariputta moggallana they are wise monks sympathetic toward their fellows in the holy life like the mother giving birth that s sariputta like the nurse raising a child after it s born that s moggallana sariputta trains others to the fruit of stream entry moggallana to the highest goal that is what the blessed one said having said it he the one well gone rose from his seat and entered his dwelling then ven sariputta not long after the blessed one had left addressed the monks friends yes friend the monks responded ven sariputta said friends at varanasi in the game refuge at isipatana the tathagatha the worthy one the rightly self awakened one set in motion the unexcelled wheel of dhamma that cannot be stopped by brahman or contemplative deity mara or brahma or anyone at all in the cosmos in other words the declaration teaching description setting forth revelation explanation and making plain of the four noble truths of which four the declaration teaching description setting forth revelation explanation and making plain of the noble truth of stress the noble truth of the origination of stress the noble truth of the cessation of stress the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress at varanasi in the game refuge at isipatana the tathagatha the worthy one the rightly self awakened one set in motion the unexcelled wheel of dhamma that cannot be stopped by brahman or contemplative deity mara or brahma or anyone at all in the cosmos in other words the declaration teaching description setting forth revelation explanation and making plain of these four noble truths now what friends is the noble truth of stress birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress despair are stressful not getting what is wanted is stressful and what is and what is and what is and what is and what is and what is and what is and what is and what is the stress of and what are the this friends is called the noble truth of stress and what friends is the noble truth of the origination of stress the craving that makes for further becoming accompanied by passion delight relishing now here now there i e craving for sensuality craving for becoming craving for non becoming this is called the noble truth of the origination of stress and what friends is the noble truth of the cessation of stress the remainderless fading cessation renunciation relinquishment release letting go of that very craving this is called the noble truth of the cessation of stress and what friends is the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress just this very noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration and what is right view knowledge with reference to stress knowledge with reference to the origination of stress knowledge with reference to the cessation of stress knowledge with reference to the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress this is called right view and what is right resolve the resolve for renunciation for freedom from ill will for harmlessness this is called right resolve and what is right speech abstaining from lying from divisive speech from abusive speech from idle chatter this is called right speech and what is right action abstaining from taking life from stealing from sexual misconduct this is called right action and what is right livelihood there is the case where a disciple of the noble ones having abandoned dishonest livelihood keeps his life going with right livelihood this is called right livelihood and what is right effort there is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors arouses persistence upholds exerts his intent for the sake of the non arising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the sake of the abandoning of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen and what is right mindfulness there is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in of itself ardent alert mindful putting aside greed distress with reference to the world he remains focused on feelings in of themselves the mind in of itself mental qualities in of themselves ardent alert mindful putting aside greed distress with reference to the world this is called right mindfulness and what is right concentration there is the case where a monk quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful this is called the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress friends at varanasi in the game refuge at isipatana the tathagatha the worthy one the rightly self awakened one set in motion the unexcelled wheel of dhamma that cannot be stopped by brahman or contemplative deity mara or brahma or anyone at all in the cosmos in other words the declaration teaching description setting forth revelation explanation and making plain of these four noble truths that is what ven sariputta said gratified the monks delighted in ven sariputta s words i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was living among the yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said as you say master frying pan answered the bamboo acrobat and climbing the bamboo pole stood on his shoulders so then the bamboo acrobat said to his assistant now you watch after me my dear frying pan and i ll watch after you thus protecting one another watching after one another we ll show off our skill receive our reward and come down safely from the bamboo pole when he had said this frying pan said to him but that won t do at all master you watch after yourself and i ll watch after myself and thus with each of us protecting ourselves watching after ourselves we ll show off our skill receive our reward and come down safely from the bamboo pole what frying pan the assistant said to her master was the right way in that case monks the establishing of mindfulness is to be practiced with the thought i ll watch after myself the establishing of mindfulness is to be practiced with the thought i ll watch after others when watching after yourself you watch after others when watching after others you watch after yourself and how do you watch after others when watching after yourself through cultivating the practice through developing it through pursuing it this is how you watch after others when watching after yourself and how do you watch after yourself when watching after others through endurance through harmlessness through a mind of goodwill through sympathy this is how you watch after yourself when watching after others the establishing of mindfulness is to be practiced with the thought i ll watch after myself the establishing of mindfulness is to be practiced with the thought i ll watch after others when watching after yourself you watch after others when watching after others you watch after yourself monks these two are fools which two the one who doesn t see his transgression as a transgression and the one who doesn t rightfully pardon another who has confessed his transgression these two are fools these two are wise people which two the one who sees his transgression as a transgression and the one who rightfully pardons another who has confessed his transgression these two are wise people on one occasion yes friend the monks responded ven mahacunda said this when a monk utters words about knowing saying i know this dhamma i see this dhamma but he remains with his mind conquered by greed his mind conquered by aversion delusion anger hostility hypocrisy spite selfishness evil envy or evil longing then it should be known of him that this

one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one mahali there is cause there is requisite condition for the defilement of beings beings are defiled with cause with requisite condition there is cause there is requisite condition for the purification of beings beings are purified with cause with requisite condition and what lord is the cause what the requisite condition for the defilement of beings how are beings defiled with cause with requisite condition mahali if form were exclusively stressful followed by stress infused with stress and not infused with pleasure beings would not be infatuated with form but because form is also pleasurable followed by pleasure infused with pleasure and not infused with stress beings are infatuated with form through infatuation they are captivated through captivation they are defiled this is the cause this the requisite condition for the defilement of beings and this is how beings are defiled with cause with requisite condition if feeling were exclusively stressful if perception were exclusively stressful if fabrications were exclusively stressful if consciousness were exclusively stressful followed by stress infused with stress and not infused with pleasure beings would not be infatuated with consciousness but because consciousness is also pleasurable followed by pleasure infused with pleasure and not infused with stress beings are infatuated with consciousness through infatuation they are captivated through captivation they are defiled this is the cause this the requisite condition for the defilement of beings and this is how beings are defiled with cause with requisite condition and what lord is the cause what the requisite condition for the purification of beings how are beings purified with cause with requisite condition mahali if form were exclusively pleasurable followed by pleasure infused with pleasure and not infused with stress beings would not be disenchanted with form but because form is also stressful followed by stress infused with stress and not infused with pleasure beings are disenchanted with form through disenchantment they grow dispassionate through dispassion they are purified this is the cause this the requisite condition for the purification of beings and this is how beings are purified with cause with requisite condition if feeling were exclusively pleasurable if perception were exclusively pleasurable if fabrications were exclusively pleasurable if consciousness were exclusively pleasurable followed by pleasure infused with pleasure and not infused with stress beings would not be disenchanted with consciousness but because consciousness is also stressful followed by stress infused with stress and not infused with pleasure beings are disenchanted with consciousness through disenchantment they grow dispassionate through dispassion they are purified this is the cause this the requisite condition for the purification of beings and this is how beings are purified with cause with requisite condition i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near the brahmans of the western lands lord those who carry water pots wear garlands of water plants worship fire purify with water they have declared purification rites of which i approve and what kind of purification rites have they declared those brahmans of the western lands who carry water pots wear garlands of water plants worship fire purify with water there is the case where the brahmans of the western lands get their disciples to undertake their practice thus come now my good man get up at the proper time from your bed and touch the earth if you don t touch the earth touch wet cow dung if you don t touch wet cow dung touch green grass if you don t touch green grass worship a fire if you don t worship a fire pay homage to the sun with clasped hands if you don t pay homage to the sun with clasped hands go down into the water three times by nightfall these are the purification rites declared by the brahmans of the western lands of which i approve cunda the purification rites declared by the brahmans of the western lands are one thing the purification in the discipline of the noble ones is something else entirely but how is there purification in the discipline of the noble ones lord it would be good if the blessed one would teach me how there is purification in the discipline of the noble ones then in that case cunda listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord cunda the silversmith responded unskillful bodily action and how is one made impure in three ways by bodily action there is the case where a certain person takes life is a hunter bloody handed devoted to killing slaying showing no mercy to living beings he takes what is not given he takes in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them he engages in sensual misconduct he gets sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another man this is how one is made impure in three ways by bodily action unskillful verbal action and how is one made impure in four ways by verbal action there is the case where a certain person engages in false speech when he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty i e a royal court proceeding if he is asked as a witness come tell good man what you know if he doesn t know he says i know if he does know he says i don t know if he hasn t seen he says i have seen if he has seen he says i haven t seen thus he consciously tells lies for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of a certain reward he engages in divisive speech what he has heard here he tells there to break those people apart from these people here what he has heard there he tells here to break these people apart from those people there thus breaking apart those who are united and stirring up strife between those who have broken apart he loves factionalism delights in factionalism enjoys factionalism speaks things that create factionalism he engages in abusive speech he speaks words that are harsh cutting bitter to others abusive of others provoking anger and destroying concentration he engages in idle chatter he speaks out of season speaks what isn t factual what isn t in accordance with the goal the dhamma the vinaya words that are not worth treasuring this is how one is made impure in four ways by verbal action unskillful mental action and how is one made impure in three ways by mental action there is the case where a certain person is covetous he covets the belongings of others thinking o that what belongs to others would be mine he bears ill will corrupt in the resolves of his heart may these beings be killed or cut apart or crushed or destroyed or may they not exist at all he has wrong view is warped in the way he sees things there is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed there is no fruit or result of good or bad actions there is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no brahmans or contemplatives who faring rightly practicing rightly proclaim this world the next after having directly known realized it for themselves this is how one is made impure in three ways by mental action these cunda are the ten courses of unskillful action when a person is endowed with these ten courses of unskillful action then even if he gets up at the proper time from his bed and touches the earth he is still impure if he doesn t touch the earth he is still impure if he touches wet cow dung he is still impure if he doesn t touch wet cow dung he is still impure if he touches green grass if he doesn t touch green grass if he worships a fire if he doesn t worship a fire if he pays homage to the sun with clasped hands if he doesn t pay homage to the sun with clasped hands if he goes down into the water three times by nightfall if he doesn t go down into the water three times by nightfall he is still impure why is that because these ten courses of unskillful action are impure and cause impurity furthermore as a result of being endowed with these ten courses of unskillful action rebirth in hell is declared rebirth in an animal womb is declared rebirth in the realm of hungry shades is declared that or any other bad destination and how is one made pure in three ways by bodily action there is the case where a certain person abandoning the taking of life abstains from the taking of life he dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beings abandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not given he does not take in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them abandoning sensual misconduct he abstains from sensual misconduct he does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another man this is how one is made pure in three ways by bodily action and how is one made pure in four ways by verbal action there is the case where a certain person abandoning false speech abstains from false speech when he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness come tell good man what you know if he doesn t know he says i don t know if he does know he says i know if he hasn t seen he says i haven t seen if he has seen he says i have seen thus he doesn t consciously tell a lie for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of any reward abandoning false speech he abstains from false speech he speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the world abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech what he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people here what he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people there thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concord abandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speech he speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing pleasing to people at large abandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatter he speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the dhamma the vinaya he speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goal this is how one is made pure in four ways by verbal action and how is one made pure in three ways by mental action there is the case where a certain person is not covetous he does not covet the belongings of others thinking o that what belongs to others would be mine he bears no ill will and is not corrupt in the resolves of his heart he thinks may these beings be free from animosity free from oppression free from trouble and may they look after themselves with ease he has right view and is not warped in the way he sees things there is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed there are fruits results of good bad actions there is this world the next world there is mother father there are spontaneously reborn beings there are brahmans contemplatives who faring rightly practicing rightly proclaim this world the next after having directly known realized it for themselves this is how one is made pure in three ways by mental action these cunda are the ten courses of skillful action when a person is endowed with these ten courses of skillful action then even if he gets up at the proper time from his bed and touches the earth he is still pure if he doesn t touch the earth he is still pure if he touches wet cow dung he is still pure if he doesn t touch wet cow dung he is still pure if he touches green grass if he doesn t touch green grass if he worships a fire if he doesn t worship a fire if he pays homage to the sun with clasped hands if he doesn t pay homage to the sun with clasped hands if he goes down into the water three times by nightfall if he doesn t go down into the water three times by nightfall he is still pure why is that because these ten courses of skillful action are pure and cause purity furthermore as a result of being endowed with these ten courses of skillful action rebirth among the devas is declared rebirth among human beings is declared that or any other good destination when this was said cunda the silversmith said to the blessed one on one occasion the blessed one was staying near nigantha nataputta teaches the dhamma to his disciples in this way lord all those who take life are destined for a state of deprivation are destined for hell all those who steal all those who indulge in illicit sex all those who tell lies are destined for a state of deprivation are destined for hell whatever one keeps doing frequently by that is one led to a state of rebirth that s how nigantha nataputta teaches the dhamma to his disciples if it s true that whatever one keeps doing frequently by that is one led to a state of rebirth then no one is destined for a state of deprivation or destined to hell in line with nigantha nataputta s words what do you think headman if a man is one who takes life then taking into consideration time spent doing not doing whether by day or by night which time is more the time he spends taking life or the time he spends not taking life if a man is one who takes life lord then taking into consideration time spent doing not doing whether by day or by night then the time he spends taking life is less and the time he spends not taking life is certainly more if it s true that whatever one keeps doing frequently by that is one led to a state of rebirth then no one is destined for a state of deprivation or destined to hell in line with nigantha nataputta s words what do you think headman if a man is one who steals indulges in illicit sex tells lies then taking into consideration time spent doing not doing whether by day or by night which time is more the time he spends telling lies or the time he spends not telling lies if a man is one who tells lies lord then taking into consideration time spent doing not doing whether by day or by night then the time he spends telling lies is less and the time he spends not telling lies is certainly more if it s true that whatever one keeps doing frequently by that is one led to a state of rebirth then no one is destined for a state of deprivation or destined to hell in line with nigantha nataputta s words there s the case headman where a certain teacher holds this doctrine holds this view all those who take life are destined for a state of deprivation are destined for hell all those who steal all those who indulge in illicit sex all those who tell lies are destined for a state of deprivation are destined for hell a disciple has faith in that teacher and the thought occurs to him our teacher holds this doctrine holds this view all those who take life are destined for a state of deprivation are destined for hell there are living beings that i have killed i too am destined for a state of deprivation am destined for hell he fastens onto that view if he doesn t abandon that doctrine doesn t abandon that state of mind doesn t relinquish that view then as if he were to be carried off he would thus be placed in hell the thought occurs to him our teacher holds this doctrine holds this view all those who steal all those who indulge in illicit sex all those who tell lies are destined for a state of deprivation are destined for hell there are lies that i have told i too am destined for a state of deprivation am destined for hell he fastens onto that view if he doesn t abandon that doctrine doesn t abandon that state of mind doesn t relinquish that view then as if he were to be carried off he would thus be placed in hell there is the case headman where a tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly self awakened consummate in clear knowing conduct well gone a knower of the cosmos unexcelled trainer of those to be tamed teacher of human divine beings awakened blessed he in various ways criticizes censures the taking of life and says abstain from taking life he criticizes censures stealing and says abstain from stealing he criticizes censures indulging in illicit sex and says abstain from indulging in illicit sex he criticizes censures the telling of lies and says abstain from the telling of lies a disciple has faith in that teacher and reflects the blessed one in a variety of ways criticizes censures the taking of life and says abstain from taking life there are living beings that i have killed to a greater or lesser extent that was not right that was not good but if i become remorseful for that reason that evil deed of mine will not be undone so reflecting thus he abandons right then the taking of life and in the future refrains from taking life this is how there comes to be the abandoning of that evil deed this is how there comes to be the transcending of that evil deed having abandoned the taking of life he refrains from taking life having abandoned stealing he refrains from stealing having abandoned illicit sex he refrains from illicit sex having abandoned lies he refrains from lies having abandoned divisive speech he refrains from divisive speech having abandoned harsh speech he refrains from harsh speech having abandoned idle chatter he refrains from idle chatter having abandoned covetousness he becomes uncovetous having abandoned ill will anger he becomes one with a mind of no ill will having abandoned wrong views he becomes one who has right views when this was said asibandhakaputta the headman the disciple of the niganthas said to the blessed one contents monks suppose that a man were to cut down all the grass sticks branches leaves in india and to gather them into a heap having gathered them into a heap he would make stakes from them and having made stakes freed from this great plane of deprivation is the individual consummate in view who discerns as it has come to be that this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress therefore your duty is the contemplation this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress endowed with four qualities monks a warrior is worthy of a king an asset to a king and counts as a very limb of his king which four there is the case where a warrior is skilled in his stance able to shoot far able to fire shots in rapid succession and able to pierce great objects a warrior endowed with these four qualities is worthy of a king an asset to a king and counts as a very limb of his king in the same way a monk endowed with four qualities is deserving of gifts deserving of hospitality deserving of offerings deserving of respect an unexcelled field of merit for the world which four there is the case where a monk is skilled in his stance able to shoot far able to fire shots in rapid succession and able to pierce great objects a monk endowed with these four qualities is deserving of gifts deserving of hospitality deserving of offerings deserving of respect an unexcelled field of merit for the world and how is a monk skilled in his stance there is the case where a monk is virtuous he dwells restrained in accordance with the patimokkha consummate in his behavior sphere of activity he trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faults this is how a monk is skilled in his stance and how is a monk one who is able to shoot far there is the case where a monk sees any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am he sees any feeling whatsoever he sees any perception whatsoever he sees any fabrications whatsoever he sees any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am this is how a monk is one who is able to shoot far and how is a monk one who is able to fire shots in rapid succession there is the case where a monk discerns as it actually is present that this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress this is how a monk is one who is able to fire shots in rapid succession and how is a monk one who is able to pierce great objects there is the case where a monk pierces right through the great mass of ignorance this is how a monk is one who is able to pierce great objects right through endowed with these four qualities a monk is deserving of gifts deserving of hospitality deserving of offerings deserving of respect an unexcelled field of merit for the world thus have i heard at one time the lord was staying near savatthi in the jeta wood at anathapindika s monastery on that occasion the lord was instructing the bhikkhus with a dhamma talk connected with nibbana and those bhikkhus were intent on listening to dhamma then on realizing its significance the lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance the uninclined is hard to see the truth is not easy to see craving is penetrated by one who knows for one who sees there is nothing magandiya offers his daughter to the buddha who replies magandiya the buddha magandiya the buddha magandiya the buddha as dwelling in s vatthi and then there where the blessed one was there venerable bhaddiya the dwarf approached the blessed one saw venerable bhaddiya the dwarf approaching even from afar having seen him he addressed the monks do you see monks that monk approaching of bad complexion of bad appearance dwarfish of such a form as to be despised by the monks just so venerable sir monks that monk is of great power of great eminence there is no well gained attainment that has not already been attained by that monk for that benefit for which sons of good lineage rightly go forth from home into homelessness that ultimate conclusion of the holy life even in this very life by himself having seen with his own eyes the higher knowledge and having attained he abides this was said by the blessed one having said that the fortunate one the teacher also said this swans herons and peacocks elephants and spotted deer all fear the lion although their bodies are not equal just so amongst humans if a small one is wisdom endowed there certainly he is great and not the fool endowed with a large body at savatthi monks feeling born of eye contact is inconstant changeable alterable feeling born of ear contact feeling born of nose contact feeling born of tongue contact feeling born of body contact feeling born of intellect contact is inconstant changeable alterable one who has conviction belief that these phenomena are this way is called a faith follower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the run of the mill he is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry shades he is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry one who after pondering with a modicum of discernment has accepted that these phenomena are this way is called a dhamma follower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the run of the mill he is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry shades he is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry one who knows and sees that these phenomena are this way is called a stream enterer steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for self awakening i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near savatthi at jeta s grove anathapindika s monastery then early in the morning several monks put on their robes and carrying their bowls and outer robes went into savatthi for alms the thought occurred to them it s still too early to go into savatthi for alms what if we were to visit the park of the wanderers of other persuasions so they headed to the park of the wanderers of other persuasions on arrival they exchanged courteous greetings with the wanderers of other persuasions after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies they sat to one side as they were sitting there the wanderers of other persuasions said to them friends gotama the contemplative describes the comprehension of sensuality we too describe the comprehension of sensuality he describes the comprehension of forms we too describe the comprehension of forms he describes the comprehension of feelings we too describe the comprehension of feelings so what is the difference what the distinction what the distinguishing factor between him and us in terms of his teaching and ours his message and ours the monks neither delighting nor disapproving of the words of the wanderers of other persuasions got up from their seats thinking we will learn the meaning of these words in the blessed one s presence then having gone for alms in savatthi after their meal returning from their alms round the monks went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they told him what had happened monks when the wanderers of other persuasions say this they are to be told what friends with regard to sensuality is the allure what the drawback what the escape what with regard to forms is the allure what the drawback what the escape what with regard to feelings is the allure what the drawback what the escape when asked this they will not manage an answer and what is more will get themselves into trouble why is that because it lies outside their range monks in this world with its devas maras and brahmas in this people with its contemplatives brahmans its royalty commonfolk i do not see anyone who can satisfy the mind with an answer to these questions aside from a tathagata a tathagata s disciples or someone who has heard it from them sensuality now what monks is the allure of sensuality these now this drawback in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality if the clansman gains no wealth while thus working striving making effort he sorrows grieves laments beats his breast becomes distraught my work is in vain my efforts are fruitless now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality if the clansman gains wealth while thus working striving making effort he experiences pain distress in protecting it how will neither kings nor thieves make off with my property nor fire burn it nor water sweep it away nor hateful heirs make off with it and as he thus guards and watches over his property kings or thieves make off with it or fire burns it or water sweeps it away or hateful heirs make off with it and he sorrows grieves laments beats his breast becomes distraught what was mine is no more now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source sensuality for the cause the reason being simply sensuality that kings quarrel with kings nobles with nobles brahmans with brahmans householders with householders mother with child child with mother father with child child with father brother with brother sister with sister brother with sister sister with brother friend with friend and then in their quarrels brawls disputes they attack one another with fists or with clods or with sticks or with knives so that they incur death or deadly pain now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that men taking swords shields and buckling on bows quivers charge into battle massed in double array while arrows spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are wounded by arrows spears and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly pain now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that men taking swords shields and buckling on bows quivers charge slippery bastions while arrows spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are splashed with boiling cow dung and crushed under heavy weights and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly pain now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that men break into windows seize plunder commit burglary ambush highways commit adultery and when they are captured kings have them tortured in many ways they flog them with whips beat them with canes beat them with clubs they cut off their hands cut off their feet cut off their hands feet they cut off their ears cut off their noses cut off their ears noses they subject them to the porridge pot the polished shell shave the rahu s mouth the flaming garland the blazing hand the grass duty ascetic the bark dress ascetic the burning antelope the meat hooks the coin gouging the lye pickling the pivot on a stake the rolled up bed they have them splashed with boiling oil devoured by dogs impaled alive on stakes they have their heads cut off with swords so that they incur death or deadly pain now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that people engage in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct having engaged in bodily verbal and mental misconduct they on the break up of the body after death re appear in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress in the future life has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality and what monks is the escape from sensuality the subduing of desire passion for sensuality the abandoning of desire passion for sensuality that is the escape from sensuality that any brahmans or contemplatives who do not discern as it actually is the allure of sensuality as allure the drawback of sensuality as drawback the escape from sensuality as escape would themselves comprehend sensuality or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend sensuality that is impossible but that any brahmans or contemplatives who discern as it actually is the allure of sensuality as allure the drawback of sensuality as drawback the escape from sensuality as escape would themselves comprehend sensuality or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend sensuality that is possible form now what monks is the allure of forms suppose there were a maiden of the noble caste the brahman caste or the householder class fifteen or sixteen years old neither too tall nor too short neither too thin nor too plump neither too dark nor too pale is her beauty charm at that time at its height yes lord whatever pleasure joy arise in dependence on that beauty charm that is the allure of forms and what is the drawback of forms there is the case where one might see that very same woman at a later time when she s eighty ninety one hundred years old aged roof rafter crooked bent over supported by a cane palsied miserable broken toothed gray haired scanty haired bald wrinkled her body all blotchy what do you think has her earlier beauty charm vanished and the drawback appeared yes lord this monks is the drawback of forms again one might see that very same woman sick in pain seriously ill lying soiled with her own urine excrement lifted up by others laid down by others what do you think has her earlier beauty charm vanished and the drawback appeared yes lord this too monks is the drawback of forms again one might see that very same woman as a corpse cast away in a charnel ground one day two days three days dead bloated livid oozing what do you think has her earlier beauty charm vanished and the drawback appeared yes lord this too monks is the drawback of forms again one might see that very same woman as a corpse cast away in a charnel ground picked at by crows vultures hawks by dogs hyenas various other creatures a skeleton smeared with flesh blood connected with tendons a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood connected with tendons a skeleton without flesh or blood connected with tendons bones detached from their tendons scattered in all directions here a hand bone there a foot bone here a shin bone there a thigh bone here a hip bone there a back bone here a rib there a breast bone here a shoulder bone there a neck bone here a jaw bone there a tooth here a skull the bones whitened somewhat like the color of shells piled up more than a year old decomposed into a powder what do you think has her earlier beauty charm vanished and the drawback appeared yes lord this too monks is the drawback of forms and what monks is the escape from forms the subduing of desire passion for forms the abandoning of desire passion for forms that is the escape from form that any brahmans or contemplatives who do not discern as it actually is the allure of forms as allure the drawback of forms as drawback the escape from forms as escape would themselves comprehend form or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend form that is impossible but that any brahmans or contemplatives who discern as it actually is the allure of forms as allure the drawback of forms as drawback the escape from forms as escape would themselves comprehend form or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend form that is possible feeling now what monks is the allure of feelings there is the case where a monk quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation at that time he does not intend his own affliction the affliction of others or the affliction of both he feels a feeling totally unafflicted the unafflicted i tell you is the highest allure of feelings again the monk with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress he enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain at that time he does not intend his own affliction the affliction of others or the affliction of both he feels a feeling totally unafflicted the unafflicted i tell you is the highest allure of feelings and what is the drawback of feelings the fact that feeling is inconstant stressful subject to change this is the drawback of feelings and what is the escape from feelings the subduing of desire passion for feelings the abandoning of desire passion for feelings that is the escape from feelings that any brahmans or contemplatives who do not discern as it actually is the allure of feelings as allure the drawback of feelings as drawback the escape from feelings as escape would themselves comprehend feeling or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend feeling that is impossible but that any brahmans or contemplatives who discern as it actually is the allure of feelings as allure the drawback of feelings as drawback the escape from feelings as escape would themselves comprehend feeling or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend feeling that is possible that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living near rajagaha in the bamboo grove in the squirrels feeding ground at that time the venerable maha kassapa who was living in the pipphali cave was afflicted with a disease was suffering therefrom and was gravely ill then the blessed one arising from his solitude at eventide visited the venerable maha kassapa and sat down on a seat made ready for him thus seated the blessed one spoke to the venerable maha kassapa well kassapa how is it with you are you bearing up are you enduring your suffering do your pains decrease or increase are there signs of your pains decreasing and not of increasing no ven sir i am not bearing up i am not enduring the pain is very great there is a sign not of pains decreasing but of their increasing kassapa these seven factors of enlightenment are well expounded by me and are cultivated and fully developed by me they conduce to perfect understanding to full realization of the four noble truths and to nibbana what are the seven i mindfulness the factor of enlightenment kassapa is well expounded by me and is cultivated and fully developed by me it conduces to perfect understanding to full realization and to nibbana ii investigation of the dhamma the factor of enlightenment kassapa is well expounded by me and is cultivated and fully developed by me it conduces to perfect understanding to full realization and to nibbana iii persevering effort the factor of enlightenment kassapa is well expounded by me and is cultivated and fully developed by me it conduces to perfect understanding to full realization and to nibbana iv rapture the factor of enlightenment kassapa is well expounded by me and is cultivated and fully developed by me it conduces to perfect understanding to full realization and to nibbana v calm the factor of enlightenment kassapa is well expounded by me and is cultivated and fully developed by me it conduces to perfect understanding to full realization and to nibbana vi concentration the factor of enlightenment kassapa is well expounded by me and is cultivated and fully developed by me it conduces to perfect understanding to full realization and to nibbana vii equanimity the factor of enlightenment kassapa is well expounded by me and is cultivated and fully developed by me it conduces to perfect understanding to full realization and to nibbana these seven factors of enlightenment kassapa are well expounded by me and are cultivated and fully developed by me they conduce to perfect understanding to full realization and to nibbana most assuredly o blessed one they are factor of enlightenment most assuredly o welcome being sugata they are factors of enlightenment thus said the buddha and the venerable maha kassapa glad at heart approved the utterances of the buddha thereupon the venerable kassapa recovered from that affliction and that affliction of the venerable kassapa disappeared at savatthi then a certain monk went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one lord in such and such a dwelling a certain monk newly ordained not well known is diseased in pain severely ill it would be good if the blessed one would visit the monk out of sympathy for him then the blessed one on hearing the word newly ordained on hearing the word diseased and realizing that the monk was not well known went to him the monk saw the blessed one coming from afar and on seeing him stirred in his bed then the blessed one said to him enough monk don t stir in your bed there are these seats made ready i will sit down there the blessed one sat down on a seat made ready and said to the monk i hope you are getting better monk i hope you are comfortable i hope that your pains are lessening and not increasing i hope that there are signs of their lessening and not of their increasing i am not getting better lord i am not comfortable my extreme pains are increasing not lessening there are signs of their increasing and not of their lessening then i hope you have no anxiety monk i hope you have no anguish yes lord i do have not a small amount of anxiety not a small amount of anguish i hope you can t fault yourself with regard to your virtue no lord i can t fault myself with regard to my virtue then what are you anxious about what is your anguish i understand that the blessed one has not taught the dhamma with purity of virtue as its goal if you understand that i have not taught the dhamma with purity of virtue as its goal then for what goal do you understand that i have taught the dhamma i understand that the blessed one has taught the dhamma with the fading of passion as its goal good good monk it s good that you understand that i have taught the dhamma with the fading of passion as its goal for i what do you think monk is the eye constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord is the ear constant or inconstant inconstant lord is the nose constant or inconstant inconstant lord is the tongue constant or inconstant inconstant lord is the body constant or inconstant inconstant lord what do you think monk is the intellect constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with the eye disenchanted with the ear disenchanted with the nose disenchanted with the tongue disenchanted with the body disenchanted with the intellect disenchanted he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is fully released with full release there is the knowledge fully released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world and better than chanting hundredsi have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near if great king one speaking rightly could say of anyone he has awakened to the unexcelled right self awakening one could rightly say that of me for i great king have awakened to the unexcelled right self awakening but master gotama those brahmans contemplatives each with his group each with his community each the teacher of his group an honored leader well regarded by people at large i e there are these that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further you shouldn t look down on for being young a noble warrior of consummate birth a high born prince of great status a person shouldn t disparage him for it s possible that this lord of human beings this noble warrior will gain the throne and angered at that disparagement come down harshly with his royal might so guarding your life avoid him you shouldn t look down on for being young a serpent you meet in village or wilderness a person shouldn t disparage it as that potent snake slithers along with vibrant colors it may someday burn the fool whether woman or man so guarding your life avoid it you shouldn t look down on for being young a blaze that feeds on many things a flame with its blackened trail a person shouldn t disparage it for if it gains sustenance becoming a great mass of flame it may someday burn the fool whether woman or man so guarding your life avoid it when a fire burns down a forest that flame with its blackened trail the shoots there take birth once more with the passage of days nights but if a monk his virtue consummate burns you with his potency when this was said king pasenadi kosala said to the blessed one at when this was said a certain monk said to the blessed one in what way would a monk set on this it should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to me break the five lower fetters there is the case monk where an uninstructed run of the mill person who has no regard for noble ones is not well versed or disciplined in their dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not well versed or disciplined in their dhamma assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form he assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or feeling as in the self or the self as in feeling he assumes perception to be the self or the self as possessing perception or perception as in the self or the self as in perception he assumes mental fabrications to be the self or the self as possessing fabrications or fabrications as in the self or the self as in fabrications he assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness he does not discern as it actually is inconstant form as inconstant form he does not discern as it actually is inconstant feeling as inconstant feeling inconstant perception as inconstant perception inconstant fabrications as inconstant fabrications inconstant consciousness as inconstant consciousness he does not discern as it actually is stressful form as stressful form stressful feeling as stressful feeling stressful perception as stressful perception stressful fabrications as stressful fabrications stressful consciousness as stressful consciousness he does not discern as it actually is not self form as not self form not self feeling as not self feeling not self perception as not self perception not self fabrications as not self fabrications not self consciousness as not self consciousness he does not discern as it actually is fabricated form as fabricated form fabricated feeling as fabricated feeling fabricated perception as fabricated perception fabricated fabrications as fabricated fabrications fabricated consciousness as fabricated consciousness he does not discern as it actually is that form will stop being feeling will stop being perception will stop being fabrications will stop being consciousness will stop being now a well instructed disciple of the noble ones who has regard for noble ones is well versed disciplined in their dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is well versed disciplined in their dhamma does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form he does not assume feeling to be the self does not assume perception to be the self does not assume fabrications to be the self he does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness he discerns as it actually is inconstant form as inconstant form inconstant feeling as inconstant feeling inconstant perception as inconstant perception inconstant fabrications as inconstant fabrications inconstant consciousness as inconstant consciousness he discerns as it actually is stressful form as stressful form stressful feeling as stressful feeling stressful perception as stressful perception stressful fabrications as stressful fabrications stressful consciousness as stressful consciousness he discerns as it actually is not self form as not self form not self feeling as not self feeling not self perception as not self perception not self fabrications as not self fabrications not self consciousness as not self consciousness he discerns as it actually is fabricated form as fabricated form fabricated feeling as fabricated feeling fabricated perception as fabricated perception fabricated fabrications as fabricated fabrications fabricated consciousness as fabricated consciousness he discerns as it actually is that form will stop being feeling will stop being perception will stop being fabrications will stop being consciousness will stop being from the stopping of form from the stopping of feeling of perception of fabrications of consciousness a monk set on this it should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to me would break the five lower fetters lord a monk set on this would break the five lower fetters but for one knowing in what way seeing in what way is there the immediate ending of fermentations there is the case where an uninstructed run of the mill person falls into fear over what is not grounds for fear there is fear for an uninstructed run of the mill person who thinks it should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to me but an instructed disciple of the noble ones does not fall into fear over what is not grounds for fear there is no fear for an instructed disciple of the noble ones who thinks it should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to me should consciousness when standing still stand attached to a physical form supported by form as its object established on form watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase proliferation should consciousness when standing still stand attached to feeling supported by feeling as its object established on feeling watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase proliferation should consciousness when standing still stand attached to perception supported by perception as its object established on perception watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase proliferation should consciousness when standing still stand attached to fabrications supported by fabrications as its object established on fabrications watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase proliferation were someone to say i will describe a coming a going a passing away an arising a growth an increase or a proliferation of consciousness apart from form from feeling from perception from fabrications that would be impossible if a monk abandons passion for the property of form if a monk abandons passion for the property of feeling if a monk abandons passion for the property of perception if a monk abandons passion for the property of fabrications if a monk abandons passion for the property of consciousness then owing to the abandonment of passion the support is cut off and there is no base for consciousness consciousness thus unestablished not proliferating not performing any function is released owing to its release it stands still owing to its stillness it is contented owing to its contentment it is not agitated not agitated he the monk is totally unbound right within he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world for one knowing in this way seeing in this way monk there is the immediate ending of fermentations thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living at dakkhinagiri monastery in the brahmana village ekanala in magadha now at that time it being the sowing season five hundred plows of the brahman kasibharadvaja were put to use then in the forenoon the blessed one having dressed himself took bowl and double robe and went to the place where brahman kasibharadvaja s work was going on it was the time of food distribution by the brahman and the blessed one drew near and stood at one side bharadvaja seeing the blessed one standing there for alms said to him recluse i do plow and do sow and having plowed and sown i eat you also recluse should plow and sow having plowed and sown you should eat i too brahman plow and sow having plowed and sown i eat we do not see the venerable gotama s yoke or plow or plowshare or goad or oxen nevertheless the venerable gotama says i too brahman plow and sow having plowed and sown i eat thereupon the brahman addressed the blessed one in a stanza then brahman kasibharadvaja filling a golden bowl with milk rice offered it to the blessed one saying may the venerable gotama partake of this milk rice a plowman indeed is venerable gotama who plows a plow for the fruit of deathlessness nibbana to whom then venerable gotama shall i give this milk rice brahman in the world of devas maras and brahmas or among the generation of recluses brahmanas deities and humans there is no one by whom this milk rice if eaten could be wholly digested except by the tathagata the buddha or the disciple of a tathagata therefore brahman either cast this milk rice where there is no grass or into water where there are no living creatures thereupon the brahman flung that milk rice into water where there were no living creatures and the milk rice thrown into the water smoked and steamed making the noise then the brahman kasibharadvaja alarmed with hair standing on end approached and fell with his head at the blessed one s feet and said as follows most excellent o gotama is thy teaching most excellent just as a man would set upright what is overturned reveal what is concealed point out the way to one gone astray bring an oil lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes could see objects even so the dhamma doctrine has been declared in many a manner by the venerable gotama i take refuge in the venerable gotama the buddha in the dhamma and in the sangha the order i wish to receive the novice s ordination brahman kasibharadvaja duly received both the in both ways consummate thosekinsman i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery now at that time ven mah kacc yana was sitting not far from the blessed one his legs crossed his body held erect having mindfulness immersed in the body well established to the fore within the blessed one saw ven mah kacc yana sitting not far away his legs crossed his body held erect having mindfulness immersed in the body well established to the fore within then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed if one were to have mindfulness always established continually immersed in the body thinking it should not be it should not be mine it will not be it will not be mine there are these four types of excellent thoroughbred horses to be found existing in the world which four there is the case where an excellent thoroughbred horse on seeing the shadow of the goad stick is stirred agitated thinking i wonder what task the trainer will have me do today what should i do in response some excellent thoroughbred horses are like this and this is the first type of excellent thoroughbred horse to be found existing in the world then again there is the case where an excellent thoroughbred horse is not stirred agitated on seeing the shadow of the goad stick but when his coat is pricked with the goad stick he is stirred agitated thinking i wonder what task the trainer will have me do today what should i do in response some excellent thoroughbred horses are like this and this is the second type of excellent thoroughbred horse to be found existing in the world then again there is the case where an excellent thoroughbred horse is not stirred agitated on seeing the shadow of the goad stick or when his coat is pricked but when his hide is pricked with the goad stick he is stirred agitated thinking i wonder what task the trainer will have me do today what should i do in response some excellent thoroughbred horses are like this and this is the third type of excellent thoroughbred horse to be found existing in the world then again there is the case where an excellent thoroughbred horse is not stirred agitated on seeing the shadow of the goad stick or when his coat is pricked or when his hide is pricked but when his bone is pricked with the goad stick he is stirred agitated thinking i wonder what task the trainer will have me do today what should i do in response some excellent thoroughbred horses are like this and this is the fourth type of excellent thoroughbred horse to be found existing in the world these are the four types of excellent thoroughbred horse to be found existing in the world now there are these four types of excellent thoroughbred persons to be found existing in the world which four there is the case where a certain excellent thoroughbred person hears in that town or village over there a man or woman is in pain or has died he is stirred agitated by that stirred he becomes appropriately resolute resolute he both realizes with his body the highest truth and having penetrated it with discernment sees this type of excellent thoroughbred person i tell you is like the excellent thoroughbred horse who on seeing the shadow of the goad stick is stirred agitated some excellent thoroughbred people are like this and this is the first type of excellent thoroughbred person to be found existing in the world then again there is the case where a certain excellent thoroughbred person does not hear in that town or village over there a man or woman is in pain or has died but he himself sees a man or woman in pain or dead he is stirred agitated

penetrated it with discernment sees this type of excellent thoroughbred person i tell you is like the excellent thoroughbred horse who when its bone is pricked with the goad stick is stirred agitated some excellent thoroughbred people are like this and this is the fourth type of excellent thoroughbred person to be found existing in the world these are the four types of excellent thoroughbred persons to be found existing in the world when elephants cow elephants calf elephants baby elephants go ahead of a wilderness tusker foraging for food and cut off the tips of the grasses the wilderness tusker feels irritated upset disgusted when elephants cow elephants calf elephants baby elephants chew up the wilderness tusker s stash of broken off branches he feels irritated upset disgusted when elephants cow elephants calf elephants baby elephants go ahead of the wilderness tusker on his way down to his bath and stir up the mud in the water with their trunks he feels irritated upset disgusted when cow elephants go along as the wilderness tusker is bathing and bang up against his body he feels irritated upset disgusted then the thought occurs to the wilderness tusker i now live hemmed in by elephants cow elephants calf elephants baby elephants i feed off grass with cut off tips they chew up my stash of broken off branches i drink muddied water even when i bathe cow elephants go along and bang up against my body what if i were to live alone apart from the crowd so at a later time he lives alone apart from the crowd he feeds off grass with uncut tips they don t chew up his stash of broken off branches he drinks unmuddied water when he bathes cow elephants don t go along and bang up against his body the thought occurs to him before i lived hemmed in by elephants cow elephants calf elephants baby elephants i fed off grass with cut off tips they chewed up my stash of broken off branches i drank muddied water even when i bathed cow elephants would go along and bang up against my body but now i live alone apart from the crowd i feed off grass with uncut tips they don t chew up my stash of broken off branches i drink unmuddied water when i bathe cow elephants don t go along and bang up against my body breaking off a branch with his trunk and scratching his body with it gratified he allays his itch in the same way when a monk lives hemmed in with monks nuns male female lay followers kings royal ministers sectarians their disciples the thought occurs to him i now live hemmed in by monks nuns male female lay followers kings royal ministers sectarians their disciples what if i were to live alone apart from the crowd so he seeks out a secluded dwelling a wilderness the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a forest grove the open air a heap of straw after his meal returning from his alms round he sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and brings mindfulness to the fore abandoning covetousness with regard to the world he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness he cleanses his mind of covetousness abandoning ill will and anger he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will sympathetic with the welfare of all living beings he cleanses his mind of ill will and anger abandoning sloth and drowsiness he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth and drowsiness mindful alert percipient of light he cleanses his mind of sloth and drowsiness abandoning restlessness and anxiety he dwells undisturbed his mind inwardly stilled he cleanses his mind of restlessness and anxiety abandoning uncertainty he dwells having crossed over uncertainty with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities he cleanses his mind of uncertainty having abandoned these five hindrances corruptions of awareness that weaken discernment then quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful qualities he enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation gratified he allays his itch with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance gratified he allays his itch with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding gratified he allays his itch with the abandoning of pleasure stress as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress he enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain gratified he allays his itch with the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving infinite space he enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space gratified he allays his itch with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space perceiving infinite consciousness he enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness gratified he allays his itch with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness perceiving there is nothing he enters remains in the dimension of nothingness gratified he allays his itch with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness he enters remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non perception gratified he allays his itch with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception he enters remains in the cessation of perception feeling and having seen that with discernment his mental fermentations are completely ended gratified he allays his itch then a certain monk went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one excellent monk excellent these three feelings have been spoken of by me a feeling of pleasure a feeling of pain a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain these are the three feelings spoken of by me but i have also said whatever is felt comes under stress that i have stated simply in connection with the inconstancy of fabrications that i have stated simply in connection with the nature of fabrications to end in connection with the nature of fabrications to fall away to fade away to cease in connection with the nature of fabrications to change and i have also taught the step by step cessation of fabrications when one has attained the first jh na speech has ceased when one has attained the second jh na directed thought evaluation have ceased when one has attained the third jh na rapture has ceased when one has attained the fourth jh na in and out breathing has ceased when one has attained the dimension of the infinitude of space the perception of forms has ceased when one has attained the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the perception of the dimension of the infinitude of space has ceased when one has attained the dimension of nothingness the perception of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness has ceased when one has attained the dimension of neither perception nor non perception the perception of the dimension of nothingness has ceased when one has attained the cessation of perception feeling perception feeling have ceased when a monk s effluents have ended passion has ceased aversion has ceased delusion has ceased there are o monks these three feelings pleasant feelings painful feelings and neither painful nor pleasant feelings a disciple of the buddha mindful clearly comprehending with his mind collected he knows the feelings thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living at bhikkhus only here is there a recluse only here a second recluse only here a third recluse only here a fourth recluse the doctrines of others are devoid of recluses that is how you should rightly roar your lion s roar it is possible bhikkhus that wanderers of other sects might ask but on the strength of what argument or with the support of what authority do the venerable ones say thus wanderers of other sects who ask thus may be answered in this way friends four things have been declared to us by the blessed one who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened on seeing these in ourselves we say thus only here is there a recluse only here a second recluse only here a third recluse only here a fourth recluse the doctrines of others are devoid of recluses what are the four we have confidence in the teacher we have confidence in the dhamma we have fulfilled the precepts and our companions in the dhamma are dear and agreeable to us whether they are layfolk or those gone forth these are the four things declared to us by the blessed one who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened on seeing which in ourselves we say as we do it is possible bhikkhus that wanderers of other sects might say thus friends we too have confidence in the teacher that is in our teacher we too have confidence in the dhamma that is in our dhamma we too have fulfilled the precepts that is our precepts our companions in the dhamma are dear and agreeable to us too whether they are layfolk or those gone forth what is the distinction here friends what is the variance what is the difference between you and us wanderers of other sects who ask thus may be answered in this way how then friends is the goal one or many answering rightly the wanderers of other sects would answer thus friends the goal is one not many bhikkhus any recluses or brahmans who do not understand as they actually are the origin the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escape any recluses or brahmans who understand as they actually are the origin the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of these two views are without lust without hate without delusion without craving without clinging with vision not given to favoring and opposing and they do not delight in and enjoy proliferation they are freed from birth aging and death from sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair they are freed from suffering i say bhikkhus there are these four kinds of clinging what four clinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self though certain recluses and brahmans claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging they do not completely describe the full understanding of all kinds of clinging though certain recluses and brahmans claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging they describe the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures and clinging to views without describing the full understanding of clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self why is that they do not understand two instances therefore they describe only the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures and clinging to views without describing the full understanding of clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self though certain recluses and brahmans claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging they describe the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views and clinging to rules and observances without describing the full understanding of clinging to a doctrine of self they do not understand one instance therefore they describe only the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views and clinging to rules and observances without describing the full understanding of clinging to a doctrine of self bhikkhus in such a dhamma and discipline as that it is plain that confidence in the teacher is not rightly directed that confidence in the dhamma is not rightly directed that fulfillment of the precepts is not rightly directed and that the affection among companions in the dhamma is not rightly directed why is that because that is how it is when the dhamma and discipline is badly proclaimed and badly expounded unemancipating unconducive to peace expounded by one who is not fully enlightened bhikkhus when a tathagata accomplished and fully enlightened claims to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging he completely describes the full understanding of all kinds of clinging he describes the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self bhikkhus in such a dhamma and discipline as that it is plain that confidence in the teacher is rightly directed that confidence in the dhamma is rightly directed that fulfillment of the precepts is rightly directed and that the affection among companions in the dhamma is rightly directed why is that because that is how it is when the dhamma and discipline is well proclaimed and well expounded emancipating conducive to peace expounded by one who is fully enlightened now these four kinds of clinging have what as their source what as their origin from what are they born and produced these four kinds of clinging have craving as their source craving as their origin they are born and produced from craving bhikkhus when ignorance is abandoned and true knowledge has arisen in a bhikkhu then with the fading away of ignorance and the arising of true knowledge he no longer clings to sensual pleasures no longer clings to views no longer clings to rules and observances no longer clings to a doctrine of self that is what the blessed one said the bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the blessed one s words i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at it s not easy to teach the dhamma to others ananda the dhamma should be taught to others only when five qualities are established within the person teaching which five the dhamma should be taught with the thought i will speak step by step the dhamma should be taught with the thought i will speak explaining the sequence of cause effect the dhamma should be taught with the thought i will speak out of compassion the dhamma should be taught with the thought i will speak not for the purpose of material reward the dhamma should be taught with the thought i will speak without hurting myself or others it s not easy to teach the dhamma to others ananda the dhamma should be taught to others only when these five qualities are established within the person teaching thus have i heard once the blessed one lived at saavatthii in jeta s grove in anaathapindika s monastery arittha s wrong view yes indeed friends i do hold that view then those monks wishing to dissuade arittha from that pernicious view urged admonished questioned and exhorted him thus do not say so friend arittha do not say so do not misrepresent the blessed one it is not right to misrepresent him never would the blessed one speak like that for in many ways indeed has the blessed one said of those obstructive things that they are obstructions indeed and that they necessarily obstruct him who pursues them sense desires so he has said bring little enjoyment and much suffering and disappointment the perils in them are greater sense desires are like bare bones has the blessed one said they are like a lump of flesh like a torch of straw like a pit of burning coals like a dream like borrowed goods like a fruit bearing tree like a slaughter house like a stake of swords like a snake s head are sense desires has the blessed one said yet though the monk arittha was thus urged admonished questioned and exhorted by those monks he still clung tenaciously and obstinately to his pernicious view saying there are things called obstructions by the blessed one as i understand his teaching those things are not necessarily obstructive for one who pursues them is it true arittha that you have conceived this pernicious view there are things called obstructions by the blessed one as i understand his teaching those things are not necessarily obstructive for him who pursues them yes indeed lord i understand the teaching of the blessed one in this way that those things called obstructions by the blessed one are not necessarily obstructive for him who pursues them after these words the monk arittha formerly of the vulture killers sat silent confused with his shoulders drooping and his head bent brooding and incapable of making a rejoinder then the blessed one knowing his condition spoke to him you will be known foolish man by what is your own pernicious view i shall now question the monks about this certainly not lord for in many ways has the blessed one told us of those obstructive things that they are obstructions indeed and that they necessarily obstruct him who pursues them good monks it is good that you thus understand the teaching proclaimed by me the snake suppose monks a man wants a snake looks for a snake goes in search of a snake he then sees a large snake and when he is grasping its body or its tail the snake turns back on him and bites his hand or arm or some other limb of his and because of that he suffers death or deadly pain and why because of his wrong grasp of the snake similarly o monks there are here some foolish men who study the teaching having studied it they do not wisely examine the purpose of those teachings to those who do not wisely examine the purpose these teachings will not yield insight they study the teaching only to use it for criticizing or for refuting others in disputation they do not experience the true purpose for which they ought to study the teaching to them these teachings wrongly grasped will bring harm and suffering for a long time and why because of their wrong grasp of the teachings suppose monks a man wants a snake looks for a snake goes in search of a snake he then sees a large snake and with a forked stick he holds it firmly down having done so he catches it firmly by the neck then although the snake might entwine with the coils of its body that man s hand or arm or some other limb of his still he does not on that account suffer death or deadly pain and why not because of his right grasp of the snake similarly o monks there are here some noble sons who study the teaching and having learned it they examine wisely the purpose of those teachings to those who wisely examine the purpose these teachings will yield insight they do not study the teaching for the sake of criticizing nor for refuting others in disputation they experience the purpose for which they study the teaching and to them these teachings being rightly grasped will bring welfare and happiness for a long time and why because of their right grasp of the teachings the raft suppose monks there is a man journeying on a road and he sees a vast expanse of water of which this shore is perilous and fearful while the other shore is safe and free from danger but there is no boat for crossing nor is there a bridge for going over from this side to the other so the man thinks this is a vast expanse of water and this shore is perilous and fearful but the other shore is safe and free from danger there is however no boat here for crossing nor a bridge for going over from this side to the other suppose i gather reeds sticks branches and foliage and bind them into a raft now that man collects reeds sticks branches and foliage and binds them into a raft carried by that raft laboring with hands and feet he safely crosses over to the other shore having crossed and arrived at the other shore he thinks this raft indeed has been very helpful to me carried by it laboring with hands and feet i got safely across to the other shore should i not lift this raft on my head or put it on my shoulders and go where i like what do you think about it o monks will this man by acting thus do what should be done with a raft no lord how then monks would he be doing what ought to be done with a raft here monks having got across and arrived at the other shore the man thinks this raft indeed has been very helpful to me carried by it and laboring with hands and feet i got safely across to the other shore should i not pull it up now to the dry land or let it float in the water and then go as i please by acting thus monks would that man do what should be done with a raft in the same way monks have i shown to you the teaching s similitude to a raft as having the purpose of crossing over not the purpose of being clung to grounds for viewsanxiety about unrealities lord can there be anxiety about unrealities in the external there can be o monk said the blessed one in that case monk someone thinks oh i had it that alas i have no longer oh may i have it again but alas i do not get it hence he grieves is depressed and laments beating his breast he weeps and dejection befalls him thus monk is there anxiety about unrealities in the external there can be o monk said the blessed one in that case monk someone does not think thus oh i had it that alas i have no longer oh may i have it again but alas i do not get it hence he does not grieve is not depressed does not lament he does not beat his breast nor does he weep and no dejection befalls him thus monk is there absence of anxiety about unrealities in the external there can be monk said the blessed one in that case monk someone has this view the universe is the self that i shall be after death permanent stable eternal immutable eternally the same shall i abide in that very condition he then hears a perfect one expounding the teaching for the removal of all grounds for views of all prejudices obsessions dogmas and biases for the stilling of all kamma processes for the relinquishment of all substrata of existence for the extirpation of craving for dispassion cessation nibbaana he then thinks i shall be annihilated i shall be destroyed no longer shall i exist hence he grieves is depressed and laments beating his breast he weeps and dejection befalls him thus monk is there anxiety about unrealities in the internal there can be monk said the blessed one in that case monk someone does not have this view the universe is the self eternally the same shall i abide in that very condition he then hears a perfect one expounding the teaching for the removal of all grounds for views of all prejudices obsessions dogmas and biases for the stilling of all kamma processes for the relinquishing of all substrata of existence for the extirpation of craving for dispassion cessation nibbaana he then does not think i shall be annihilated i shall be destroyed no longer shall i exist hence he does not grieve is not depressed does not lament he does not beat his breast nor does he weep and no dejection befalls him thus monk is there absence of anxiety about unrealities in the internal impermanence and not selfthe three characteristics whatever feeling whatever perception whatever mental formations whatever consciousness whether past future or present in oneself or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near all consciousness should with right wisdom thus be seen as it is this is not mine this i am not this is not my self the arahant misrepresentation as i am not as i do not teach so have i been baselessly vainly falsely and wrongly accused by some ascetics and brahmans thus a nihilist is the ascetic gotama he teaches the annihilation the destruction the non being of an existing individual what i teach now as before o monks is suffering and the cessation of suffering praise and blamenot yoursthe explicit teaching and its fruit his limbs knotted like a kala plant his body lean lined with veins knowing moderation in food drink the man of undaunted heart touched by gnats horseflies in the wilds the great wood like an elephantonce the blessed one was staying among the and nakula s mother said to the blessed one lord ever since i as a young girl was brought to nakula s father to be his wife when he was just a young boy i am not conscious of being unfaithful to him even in mind much less in body we want to see one another not only in the present life but also in the life to come the blessed one said if both husband wife want to see one another not only in the present life but also in the life to come they should be in tune with each other in conviction in tune in virtue in tune in generosity and in tune in discernment then they will see one another not only in the present life but also in the life to come husband wife both of them having conviction being responsive being restrained living by the dhamma addressing each other with loving words they benefit in manifold ways to them comes bliss their enemies are dejected when both are in tune in virtue having followed the dhamma here in this world both in tune in precepts practices they delight in the world of the devas enjoying the pleasures they desire contents monks there are these seven obsessions the obsession of sensual passion the obsession of resistance the obsession of views the obsession of uncertainty the obsession of conceit the obsession of passion for becoming the obsession of ignorance these are the seven obsessions at savatthi then just now lord a money lending householder died in savatthi i have come from conveying his heirless fortune to the royal palace ten million in silver to say nothing of the gold but even though he was a money lending householder his enjoyment of food was like this he ate broken rice pickle brine his enjoyment of clothing was like this he wore three lengths of hempen cloth his enjoyment of a vehicle was like this he rode in a dilapidated little cart with an awning of leaves that s the way it is great king that s the way it is once in the past that money lending householder provided alms for the private buddha named now because of the wasting away of that money lending householder s old merit and his non accumulation of new merit he is today boiling in the so he has reappeared in the great roruva hell lord yes great king he has reappeared in the great roruva hell that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further grain wealth silver gold or whatever other belongings you have slaves servants errand runners any dependents you must go without taking any of them you must leave all of them behind what you dothus you wander monks in your proper range your own ancestral territory when you wander in your proper range your own ancestral territory you will grow in long life beauty pleasure wealth strength and what constitutes a monk s long life and what constitutes a monk s beauty there is the case where a monk is virtuous he dwells restrained in accordance with the patimokkha consummate in his behavior sphere of activity he trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faults this constitutes a monk s beauty and what constitutes a monk s pleasure there is the case where a monk quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress he enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain this constitutes a monk s pleasure and what constitutes a monk s wealth there is the case where a monk keeps pervading the first direction the east as well as the second direction the third the fourth with an awareness imbued with good will thus he keeps pervading above below all around everywhere in every respect the all encompassing world with an awareness imbued with good will abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will he keeps pervading the first direction as well as the second direction the third the fourth with an awareness imbued with compassion imbued with appreciation he keeps pervading the first direction as well as the second direction the third the fourth with an awareness imbued with equanimity thus he keeps pervading above below all around everywhere in every respect the all encompassing world with an awareness imbued with equanimity abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will this constitutes a monk s wealth and what constitutes a monk s strength there is the case where a monk through the ending of the mental fermentations enters remains in the fermentation free awareness release discernment release having directly known realized them for himself right in the here now this constitutes a monk s strength monks i don t envision any other single strength so hard to overcome as this the strength of mara that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near but as for what s called mind intellect or consciousness the uninstructed run of the mill person is unable to grow disenchanted with it unable to grow dispassionate toward it unable to gain release from it why is that for a long time this has been relished appropriated and grasped by the uninstructed run of the mill person as this is me this is my self this is what i am thus the uninstructed run of the mill person is unable to grow disenchanted with it unable to grow dispassionate toward it unable to gain release from it the instructed disciple of the noble ones however attends carefully appropriately right there at the dependent co arising when this is that is from the arising of this comes the arising of that when this isn t that isn t from the cessation of this comes the cessation of that in other words from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications from fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name form from name form as a requisite condition come the six sense media from the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact from contact as a requisite condition comes feeling from feeling as a requisite condition comes craving from craving as a requisite condition comes clinging sustenance from clinging sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth from birth as a requisite condition then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair come into play such is the origination of this entire mass of stress suffering now from the remainderless fading cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications from the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness from the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name form from the cessation of name form comes the cessation of the six sense media from the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact from the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling from the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving from the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging sustenance from the cessation of clinging sustenance comes the cessation of becoming from the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth from the cessation of birth then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair all cease such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress suffering seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness endowed with these six qualities a person is incapable of alighting on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities even when listening to the true dhamma which six he is endowed with a present kamma obstruction a defilement obstruction a result of past kamma obstruction he lacks conviction has no desire to listen and has dull discernment endowed with these six qualities a person is incapable of alighting on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities even when listening to the true dhamma endowed with these six qualities a person is capable of alighting on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities even while listening to the true dhamma which six he is not endowed with a present kamma obstruction a defilement obstruction or a result of past kamma obstruction he has conviction has the desire to listen and is discerning endowed with these six qualities a person is capable of alighting on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities even while listening to the true dhamma it is like this kassapa when beings are in decline but when monks and nuns male and female lay followers behave respectfully and deferentially towards the dhamma towards the sangha towards the training towards meditation then then there are punna forms cognizable via the eye agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing if a monk relishes them welcomes them and remains fastened to them then in him relishing them welcoming them and remaining fastened to them there arises delight from the origination of delight i tell you comes the origination of suffering and stress there are sounds cognizable via the ear aromas cognizable by the nose flavors cognizable via the tongue tactile sensations cognizable via the body there are ideas cognizable via the intellect agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing if a monk relishes them welcomes them and remains fastened to them then in him relishing them welcoming them and remaining fastened to them there arises delight from the origination of delight i tell you comes the origination of suffering and stress there are forms cognizable via the eye agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing if a monk does not relish them welcome them or remain fastened to them then in him not relishing them not welcoming them not remaining fastened to them there arises no delight from the cessation of delight i tell you comes the cessation of suffering and stress there are sounds cognizable via the ear aromas cognizable by the nose flavors cognizable via the tongue tactile sensations cognizable via the body there are ideas cognizable via the intellect agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing if a monk does not relish them welcome them or remain fastened to them then in him not relishing them not welcoming them not remaining fastened to them there arises no delight from the cessation of delight i tell you comes the cessation of suffering and stress by this means punna you are not far from this doctrine and discipline when this was said a certain monk said to the blessed one here is where i am ill at ease lord for i don t discern as they actually are present the origination the passing away the allure the drawback and the escape from the then what do you think monk do you regard that the eye is not mine it is not my self it is not what i am yes lord very good monk when it is well seen by you with right discernment that the eye is not mine it is not my self it is not what i am then the first sphere of contact will be abandoned by you for the sake of no further becoming in the future do you regard that the ear is not mine the nose is not mine the tongue is not mine the body is not mine do you regard that the intellect is not mine it is not my self it is not what i am yes lord very good monk when it is well seen by you with right discernment that the intellect is not mine it is not my self it is not what i am then the sixth sphere of contact will be abandoned by you for the sake of no further becoming in the future well then punna now that i have instructed you with a brief instruction in which country are you going to live lord there is a country called punna the sunaparanta people are fierce they are rough if they insult and ridicule you what will you think if they insult and ridicule me i will think these sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don t hit me with their hands that is what i will think o blessed one that is what i will think o one well gone but if they hit you with their hands what will you think i will think these sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don t hit me with a clod but if they hit you with a clod i will think these sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don t hit me with a stick but if they hit you with a stick i will think these sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don t hit me with a knife but if they hit you with a knife i will think these sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don t take my life with a sharp knife but if they take your life with a sharp knife if they take my life with a sharp knife i will think there are disciples of the blessed one who horrified humiliated and disgusted by the body and by life have sought for an assassin but here i have met my assassin without searching for him good punna very good possessing such calm and self control you are fit to dwell among the sunaparantans now it is time to do as you see fit monks the clansman punna was wise he practiced the dhamma in accordance with the dhamma and did not pester me with issues related to the dhamma the clansman punna is totally unbound on one occasion a large number of senior monks were living near the senior monks acquiesced by silence then citta the householder sensing the senior monks acquiescence got up from his seat and having bowed down to them circumambulated them keeping them to his right and left when the night had passed the senior monks put on their robes in the early morning and taking their bowls outer robes went to citta s residence there they sat down on the appointed seats citta the householder went to them and having bowed down to them sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the most senior monk when this was said the senior monk was silent a second time a third time citta the householder asked concerning the various views that arise in the world when what is present do they come into being and what is absent do they not come into being a third time the senior monk was silent now on that occasion you may answer it friend isidatta now householder are you asking this concerning the various views that arise in the world when what is present do they come into being and what is absent do they not come into being yes venerable sir concerning the various views that arise in the world householder when self identity view is present these views come into being when self identity view is absent they don t come into being there is the case householder where an uninstructed run of the mill person who has no regard for noble ones is not well versed or disciplined in their dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not well versed or disciplined in their dhamma assumes form and venerable sir how does self identity view not come into being there is the case householder where a well instructed disciple of the noble ones who has regard for noble ones is well versed disciplined in their dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is well versed disciplined in their dhamma does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form he does not assume feeling to be the self he does not assume perception to be the self he does not assume fabrications to be the self he does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness this is how self identity view does not come into being venerable sir where does master isidatta come from i come from there is venerable sir a clansman from avanti named isidatta an unseen friend of mine who has gone forth have you ever seen him yes householder where is he living now venerable sir when this was said ven isidatta was silent are you my isidatta yes householder then may master isidatta delight in the charming wild mango grove at macchikasanda i will be responsible for your robes almsfood lodgings medicinal requisites that is admirably said householder then citta the householder having delighted rejoiced in ven isidatta s words with his own hand served satisfied the senior monks with choice staple non staple foods when the senior monks had finished eating and had removed their hands from their bowls they got up from their seats and left then the most senior monk said to ven isidatta it was excellent friend isidatta the way that question inspired you to answer it didn t inspire an answer in me at all whenever a similar question comes up again may it inspire you to answer as you did just now then ven isidatta having set his lodging in order and taking his bowl robes left macchikasanda and in leaving macchikasanda he was gone for good and never returned there are five ideas that ripen here and now in two ways what five faith preference hearsay learning arguing upon evidence and liking through pondering a view now something may have faith well placed in it and yet be hollow empty and false and again something may have no faith placed in it and yet be factual true and no other than it seems and so with preference and the rest if a man has faith then he guards truth when he says my faith is thus but on that account draws no unreserved conclusion only this is true the other is wrong in this way he guards the truth but there is as yet no discovery of truth and so with preference and the rest how is truth discovered here a bhikkhu lives near some village or town then a householder or his son goes to him in order to test him in three kinds of ideas in ideas provocative of greed of hate and of delusion wondering are there in this venerable one any such ideas whereby his mind being obsessed he might not knowing say i know unseeing say i see or to get others to do likewise which would be long for their harm and suffering while thus testing him he comes to find that there are no such ideas in him and he finds that the bodily and verbal behavior of that venerable one are not those of one affected by lust or hate or delusion but the true idea that this venerable one teaches is profound hard to see and discover yet it is the most peaceful and superior of all out of reach of logical ratiocination subtle for the wise to experience such a true idea cannot be taught by one affected by lust or hate or delusion it is as soon as by testing him he comes to see that he is purified from ideas provocative of lust hate and delusion that he then plants his faith in him when he visits him he respects him when he respects him he gives ear one who gives ear hears the true idea he remembers it he investigates the meaning of the ideas remembered when he does that he acquires a preference by pondering the ideas that produces interest one interested is actively committed so committed he makes a judgment according to his judgment he exerts himself when he exerts himself he comes to realize with the body the ultimate truth and he sees it by the penetrating of it with understanding that is how there is discovery of truth but there is as yet no final arrival at truth how is truth finally arrived at final arrival at truth is the repetition the keeping in being the development of those same ideas that is how there is final arrival at truth monks these are the four developments of concentration which four there is the development of concentration that when developed pursued leads to a pleasant abiding in the here now there is the development of concentration that when developed pursued leads to the attainment of knowledge vision there is the development of concentration that when developed pursued leads to mindfulness alertness there is the development of concentration that when developed pursued leads to the ending of the effluents and what is the development of concentration that when developed pursued leads to a pleasant abiding in the here now there is the case where a monk quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress he enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain this is the development of concentration that when developed pursued leads to a pleasant abiding in the here now and what is the development of concentration that when developed pursued leads to the attainment of knowledge vision there is the case where a monk attends to the perception of light and is resolved on the perception of daytime at any hour of the day day for him is the same as night night is the same as day by means of an awareness open unhampered he develops a brightened mind this is the development of concentration that when developed pursued leads to the attainment of knowledge vision and what is the development of concentration that when developed pursued leads to mindfulness alertness there is the case where feelings are known to the monk as they arise known as they persist known as they subside perceptions are known to him as they arise known as they persist known as they subside thoughts are known to him as they arise known as they persist known as they subside this is the development of concentration that when developed pursued leads to mindfulness alertness and what is the development of concentration that when developed pursued leads to the ending of the effluents there is the case where a monk remains focused on arising falling away with reference to the five clinging aggregates such is form such its origination such its passing away such is feeling such its origination such its passing away such is perception such its origination such its passing away such are fabrications such their origination such their passing away such is consciousness such its origination such its disappearance this is the development of concentration that when developed pursued leads to the ending of the effluents these are the four developments of concentration and it was in connection with this that i stated in he who has fathomed the far near in the world for whom there is nothing perturbing in the world his vices evaporated undesiring untroubled at peace he i tell you has crossed over birth aging i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at in that case venerable ones go to the hermitage of as you say friend the monks replied to ven ananda and left then the blessed one having gone for alms after his meal on returning from his alms round said to ven ananda ananda let s go to the eastern park the palace of as you say lord ven ananda replied to the blessed one so the blessed one together with ven ananda went to the eastern park the palace of migara s mother for the day s abiding then in the evening emerging from seclusion he said to ven ananda ananda let s go to the eastern gatehouse to bathe our limbs as you say lord ven ananda replied to the blessed one so the blessed one together with ven ananda went to the eastern gatehouse to bathe his limbs having bathed his limbs at the eastern gatehouse coming out of the water he stood in his lower robe drying his limbs then ven ananda said to him lord the hermitage of rammaka the brahman is not far away pleasing is the hermitage of rammaka the brahman delightful is the hermitage of rammaka the brahman it would be good if the blessed one went to the hermitage of rammaka the brahman out of sympathy the blessed one acquiesced through silence so the blessed one went to the hermitage of rammaka the brahman now at that time a large number of monks had gathered in the hermitage of rammaka the brahman for a dhamma discussion the blessed one stood outside the door waiting for the discussion to end on knowing that the discussion had ended clearing his throat he tapped at the door the monks opened the door for him entering the hermitage of rammaka the brahman the blessed one sat down on a seat made ready as he was sitting there he addressed the monks for what discussion are you gathered together here in the midst of what discussion have you been interrupted lord our interrupted dhamma discussion was about the blessed one himself and then the blessed one arrived good monks it s fitting that you as sons of good families who have gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life should gather for dhamma discussion when you have gathered you have two duties either dhamma discussion or noble silence monks and what may be said to be subject to birth spouses children are subject to birth men women slaves goats sheep fowl pigs elephants cattle horses mares gold silver are subject to birth subject to birth are these acquisitions and one who is tied to them infatuated with them who has totally fallen for them being subject to birth seeks what is likewise subject to birth and what may be said to be subject to aging illness death sorrow defilement spouses children men women slaves goats sheep fowl pigs elephants cattle horses mares gold silver and what is the noble search there is the case where a person himself being subject to birth seeing the drawbacks of birth seeks the unborn unexcelled rest from the yoke unbinding himself being subject to aging illness death sorrow defilement seeing the drawbacks of aging illness death sorrow defilement seeks the aging less illness less deathless sorrow less undefiled unexcelled rest from the yoke unbinding this is the noble search i too monks before my awakening when i was an unawakened bodhisatta being subject myself to birth sought what was likewise subject to birth being subject myself to aging illness death sorrow defilement i sought happiness in what was likewise subject to illness death sorrow defilement the thought occurred to me why do i being subject myself to birth seek what is likewise subject to birth being subject myself to aging illness death sorrow defilement why do i seek what is likewise subject to illness death sorrow defilement what if i being subject myself to birth seeing the drawbacks of birth were to seek the unborn unexcelled rest from the yoke unbinding what if i being subject myself to aging illness death sorrow defilement seeing the drawbacks of aging illness death sorrow defilement were to seek the aging less illness less deathless sorrow less unexcelled rest from the yoke unbinding so at a later time while still young a black haired young man endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life and while my parents unwilling were crying with tears streaming down their faces i shaved off my hair beard put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness having thus gone forth in search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace i went to when this was said he replied to me you may stay here my friend this doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter dwell in his own teacher s knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledge it was not long before i quickly learned the doctrine as far as mere lip reciting repetition i could speak the words of knowledge the words of the elders and i could affirm that i knew saw i along with others i thought it isn t through mere conviction alone that alara kalama declares i have entered dwell in this dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge certainly he dwells knowing seeing this dhamma so i went to him and said to what extent do you declare that you have entered dwell in this dhamma when this was said he declared the dimension of nothingness i thought not only does alara kalama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment i too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment what if i were to endeavor to realize for myself the dhamma that alara kalama declares he has entered dwells in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge so it was not long before i quickly entered dwelled in that dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge i went to him and said friend kalama is this the extent to which you have entered dwell in this dhamma having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge yes my friend this friend is the extent to which i too have entered dwell in this dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge it is a gain for us my friend a great gain for us that we have such a companion in the holy life so the dhamma i declare i have entered dwell in having realized it for myself through direct knowledge is the dhamma you declare you have entered dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge and the dhamma you declare you have entered dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge is the dhamma i declare i have entered dwell in having realized it for myself through direct knowledge the dhamma i know is the dhamma you know the dhamma you know is the dhamma i know as i am so are you as you are so am i come friend let us now lead this community together in this way did alara kalama my teacher place me his pupil on the same level with himself and pay me great honor but the thought occurred to me this dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to awakening nor to unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of nothingness so dissatisfied with that dhamma i left in search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace i went to when this was said he replied to me you may stay here my friend this doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter dwell in his own teacher s knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledge it was not long before i quickly learned the doctrine as far as mere lip reciting repetition i could speak the words of knowledge the words of the elders and i could affirm that i knew saw i along with others i thought it wasn t through mere conviction alone that rama declared i have entered dwell in this dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge certainly he dwelled knowing seeing this dhamma so i went to uddaka and said to what extent did rama declare that he had entered dwelled in this dhamma when this was said uddaka declared the dimension of neither perception nor non perception i thought not only did rama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment i too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment what if i were to endeavor to realize for myself the dhamma that rama declared he entered dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge so it was not long before i quickly entered dwelled in that dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge i went to uddaka and said friend uddaka is this the extent to which rama entered dwelled in this dhamma having realized it for himself through direct knowledge yes my friend this friend is the extent to which i too have entered dwell in this dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge it is a gain for us my friend a great gain for us that we have such a companion in the holy life so the dhamma rama declared he entered dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge is the dhamma you declare you have entered dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge and the dhamma you declare you have entered dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge is the dhamma rama declared he entered dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge the dhamma he knew is the dhamma you know the dhamma you know is the dhamma he knew as he was so are you as you are so was he come friend lead this community in this way did uddaka ramaputta my companion in the holy life place me in the position of teacher and pay me great honor but the thought occurred to me this dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to awakening nor to unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of neither perception nor non perception so dissatisfied with that dhamma i left in search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace i wandered by stages in the then monks being subject myself to birth seeing the drawbacks of birth seeking the unborn unexcelled rest from the yoke unbinding i reached the unborn unexcelled rest from the yoke unbinding being subject myself to aging illness death sorrow defilement seeing the drawbacks of aging illness death sorrow defilement seeking the aging less illness less deathless sorrow less unexcelled rest from the yoke unbinding i reached the aging less illness less deathless sorrow less unexcelled rest from the yoke unbinding knowledge vision arose in me unprovoked is my release this is the last birth there is now no further becoming then the thought occurred to me this dhamma that i have attained is deep hard to see hard to realize peaceful refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle to be experienced by the wise just then these verses unspoken in the past unheard before occurred to me enough now with teaching what only with difficulty i reached this dhamma is not easily realized by those overcome with aversion passion what is abstruse subtle deep hard to see going against the flow those delighting in passion cloaked in the mass of darkness won t see as i reflected thus my mind inclined to dwelling at ease not to teaching the dhamma then that is what brahma sahampati said having said that he further said this in the past there appeared among the magadhans an impure dhamma devised by the stained throw open the door to the deathless let them hear the dhamma realized by the stainless one just as one standing on a rocky crag might see people all around below so o wise one with all around vision ascend the palace fashioned of dhamma free from sorrow behold the people submerged in sorrow oppressed by birth aging rise up hero then having understood brahma s invitation out of compassion for beings i surveyed the world with the eye of an awakened one as i did so i saw beings with little dust in their eyes and those with much those with keen faculties and those with dull those with good attributes and those with bad those easy to teach and those hard some of them seeing disgrace danger in the other world having seen this i answered brahma sahampati in verse open are the doors to the deathless to those with ears let them show their conviction perceiving trouble o brahma i did not tell people the refined sublime dhamma then brahma sahampati thinking the blessed one has given his consent to teach the dhamma bowed down to me and circling me on the right disappeared right there then the thought occurred to me to whom should i teach the dhamma first who will quickly understand this dhamma then the thought occurred to me this alara kalama is wise competent intelligent he has long had little dust in his eyes what if i were to teach him the dhamma first he will quickly understand this dhamma then devas came to me and said lord alara kalama died seven days ago and knowledge vision arose within me alara kalama died seven days ago the thought occurred to me a great loss has alara kalama suffered if he had heard this dhamma he would have quickly understood it then the thought occurred to me to whom should i teach the dhamma first who will quickly understand this dhamma then the thought occurred to me this uddaka ramaputta is wise competent intelligent he has long had little dust in his eyes what if i were to teach him the dhamma first he will quickly understand this dhamma then devas came to me and said lord uddaka ramaputta died last night and knowledge vision arose within me uddaka ramaputta died last night the thought occurred to me a great loss has uddaka ramaputta suffered if he had heard this dhamma he would have quickly understood it then the thought occurred to me to whom should i teach the dhamma first who will quickly understand this dhamma then the thought occurred to me they were very helpful to me the group of five monks who attended to me when i was resolute in exertion what if i were to teach them the dhamma first then the thought occurred to me where are the group of five monks staying now and with the divine eye purified surpassing the human i saw that they were staying near then having stayed at uruvela as long as i liked i set out to wander by stages to varanasi when this was said i replied to upaka the ajivaka in verses all vanquishing all knowing am i with regard to all things unadhering all abandoning released in the ending of craving having fully known on my own to whom should i point as my teacher from your claims my friend you must be an infinite conqueror conquerors are those like me who have reached fermentations end i ve conquered evil qualities and so upaka i m a conqueror when this was said upaka said may it be so my friend and shaking his head taking a side road he left then wandering by stages i arrived at varanasi at the deer park in isipatana to where the group of five monks were staying from afar they saw me coming and on seeing me made a pact with one another saying friends here comes gotama the contemplative living luxuriously straying from his exertion backsliding into abundance he doesn t deserve to be bowed down to to be greeted by standing up or to have his robe bowl received still a seat should be set out if he wants to he can sit down but as i approached they were unable to keep to their pact one standing up to greet me received my robe bowl another spread out a seat another set out water for washing my feet however they addressed me by name and as friend so i said to them don t address the tathagata by name and as friend the tathagata friends is a worthy one rightly self awakened lend ear friends the deathless has been attained i will instruct you i will teach you the dhamma practicing as instructed you will in no long time reach remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing realizing it for yourselves in the here now when this was said the group of five monks replied to me by that practice that conduct that performance of austerities you did not attain any superior human states any distinction in knowledge vision worthy of a noble one so how can you now living luxuriously straying from your exertion backsliding into abundance have attained any superior human states any distinction in knowledge vision worthy of a noble one when this was said i replied to them the tathagata monks is not living luxuriously has not strayed from his exertion has not backslid into abundance the tathagata friends is a worthy one rightly self awakened lend ear friends the deathless has been attained i will instruct you i will teach you the dhamma practicing as instructed you will in no long time reach remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing realizing it for yourselves in the here now a second time a third time the group of five monks said to me by that practice that conduct that performance of austerities you did not attain any superior human states any distinction in knowledge vision worthy of a noble one so how can you now living luxuriously straying from your exertion backsliding into abundance have attained any superior human states any distinction in knowledge vision worthy of a noble one when this was said i replied to the group of five monks do you recall my ever having spoken in this way before no lord the tathagata monks is not living luxuriously has not strayed from his exertion has not backslid into abundance the tathagata friends is a worthy one rightly self awakened lend ear friends the deathless has been attained i will instruct you i will teach you the dhamma practicing as instructed you will in no long time reach remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing realizing it for yourselves in the here now and so i was able to convince them i would teach two monks while three went for alms and we six lived off what the three brought back from their alms round then i would teach three monks while two went for alms and we six lived off what the two brought back from their alms round then the group of five monks thus exhorted thus instructed by me being subject themselves to birth seeing the drawbacks of birth seeking the unborn unexcelled rest from the yoke unbinding reached the unborn unexcelled rest from the yoke unbinding being subject themselves to aging illness death sorrow defilement seeing the drawbacks of aging illness death sorrow defilement seeking the aging less illness less deathless sorrow less unexcelled rest from the yoke unbinding they reached the aging less illness less deathless sorrow less unexcelled rest from the yoke unbinding knowledge vision arose in them unprovoked is our release this is the last birth there is now no further becoming monks there are these and any brahmans or contemplatives tied to these five strings of sensuality infatuated with them having totally fallen for them consuming them without seeing their drawbacks or discerning the escape from them should be known as having met with misfortune having met with ruin but any brahmans or contemplatives not tied to these five strings of sensuality uninfatuated with them having not totally fallen for them consuming them seeing their drawbacks and discerning the escape from them should be known as not having met with misfortune not having met with ruin mara cannot do with them as he will just as if a wild deer were to lie unbound on a heap of snares it should be known as not having met with misfortune not having met with ruin the hunter cannot do with it as he will when the hunter comes it will get away as it would like in the same way any brahmans or contemplatives not tied to these five strings of sensuality uninfatuated with them having not totally fallen for them consuming them seeing their drawbacks and discerning the escape from them should be known as not having met with misfortune not having met with ruin mara cannot do with them as he will suppose that a wild deer is living in a wilderness glen carefree it walks carefree it stands carefree it sits carefree it lies down why is that because it has gone beyond the hunter s range then again the monk with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance this monk is said to have blinded mara trackless he has destroyed mara s vision and has become invisible to the evil one then again the monk with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding this monk is said to have blinded mara trackless he has destroyed mara s vision and has become invisible to the evil one then again the monk with the abandoning of pleasure stress as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain this monk is said to have blinded mara trackless he has destroyed mara s vision and has become invisible to the evil one then again the monk with the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving infinite space enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space this monk is said to have blinded mara trackless he has destroyed mara s vision and has become invisible to the evil one then again the monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space perceiving infinite consciousness enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness this monk is said to have blinded mara trackless he has destroyed mara s vision and has become invisible to the evil one then again the monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness perceiving there is nothing enters remains in the dimension of nothingness this monk is said to have blinded mara trackless he has destroyed mara s vision and has become invisible to the evil one then again the monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness enters remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non perception this monk is said to have blinded mara trackless he has destroyed mara s vision and has become invisible to the evil one then again the monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception enters remains in the cessation of perception feeling and having seen that with discernment his mental fermentations are completely ended this monk is said to have blinded mara trackless he has destroyed mara s vision and has become invisible to the evil one having crossed over he is unattached in the world carefree he walks carefree he stands carefree he sits carefree he lies down why is that because he has gone beyond the evil one s range that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words no lord and why is that because the chain of bones is thoroughly scraped without any flesh smeared with blood the dog would get nothing but its share of weariness vexation in the same way householder a disciple of the noble ones considers this point the blessed one has compared sensuality to a chain of bones of much stress much despair greater drawbacks seeing this with right discernment as it actually is then avoiding the equanimity coming from multiplicity dependent on multiplicity he develops the equanimity coming from singleness dependent on singleness yes lord in the same way householder a disciple of the noble ones considers this point the blessed one has compared sensuality to a lump of flesh of much stress much despair greater drawbacks seeing this with right discernment as it actually is then avoiding the equanimity coming from multiplicity dependent on multiplicity he develops the equanimity coming from singleness dependent on singleness where sustenance clinging for the baits of the world ceases without trace yes lord in the same way householder a disciple of the noble ones considers this point the blessed one has compared sensuality to a grass torch of much stress much despair greater drawbacks seeing this with right discernment as it actually is then avoiding the equanimity coming from multiplicity dependent on multiplicity he develops the equanimity coming from singleness dependent on singleness where sustenance clinging for the baits of the world ceases without trace yes lord and why is that because he would realize if i fall into this pit of glowing embers i will meet with death from that cause or with death like pain in the same way householder a disciple of the noble ones considers this point the blessed one has compared sensuality to a pit of glowing embers of much stress much despair greater drawbacks seeing this with right discernment as it actually is then avoiding the equanimity coming from multiplicity dependent on multiplicity he develops the equanimity coming from singleness dependent on singleness where sustenance clinging for the baits of the world ceases without trace no lord and why is that the owners are stripping him of what is theirs in the same way householder a disciple of the noble ones considers this point the blessed one has compared sensuality to borrowed goods of much stress much despair greater drawbacks seeing this with right discernment as it actually is then avoiding the equanimity coming from multiplicity dependent on multiplicity he develops the equanimity coming from singleness dependent on singleness where sustenance clinging for the baits of the world ceases without trace yes lord in the same way householder a disciple of the noble ones considers this point the blessed one has compared sensuality to the fruits of a tree of much stress much despair greater drawbacks seeing this with right discernment as it actually is present then avoiding the equanimity coming from multiplicity dependent on multiplicity he develops the equanimity coming from singleness dependent on singleness where sustenance clinging for the baits of the world ceases without trace now when the disciple of the noble ones has arrived at this purity of equanimity mindfulness he recollects his manifold past lives i e one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction expansion there i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose there there too i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose here thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes details when the disciple of the noble ones has arrived at this purity of equanimity mindfulness he sees by means of the divine eye purified surpassing the human beings passing away re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior superior beautiful ugly fortunate unfortunate in accordance with their kamma these beings who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech mind who reviled noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell but these beings who were endowed with good conduct of body speech mind who did not revile noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world thus by means of the divine eye purified surpassing the human he sees beings passing away re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior superior beautiful ugly fortunate unfortunate in accordance with their kamma when the disciple of the noble ones has arrived at this purity of equanimity mindfulness he enters remains in the fermentation free awareness release discernment release having directly known realized them for himself right in the here now it s to this extent householder that there is the all around in every way cutting off of one s affairs in the discipline of a noble one monks there are these four establishings of mindfulness which four there is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in of itself ardent alert mindful subduing greed distress with reference to the world for him remaining focused on the body in and of itself the body is comprehended from the comprehension of the body the deathless is realized he remains focused on feelings in of themselves ardent alert mindful subduing greed distress with reference to the world for him remaining focused on feelings in of themselves feelings are comprehended from the comprehension of feelings the deathless is realized he remains focused on the mind in of itself ardent alert mindful subduing greed distress with reference to the world for him remaining focused on the mind in and of itself the mind is comprehended from the comprehension of the mind the deathless is realized he remains focused on mental qualities in of themselves ardent alert mindful subduing greed distress with reference to the world for him remaining focused on mental qualities in of themselves mental qualities are comprehended from the comprehension of mental qualities the deathless is realized once the what are the feelings o lord what is the origin of feelings what is their cessation and the way leading to their cessation what is the gratification in feelings what is the danger in feelings and what is the escape from them it is the happiness and gladness arising dependent on feelings that is the gratification in feelings feelings are impermanent liable to bring pain and are subject to change this is the danger in feelings the removal and the giving up of the desire and lust for feelings is the escape from feelings i have further taught ananda the gradual cessation of conditioned phenomena on one occasion the blessed one was living in monk can you train in reference to the three trainings the training in heightened virtue the training in heightened mind the training in heightened discernment yes lord i can train in reference to the three trainings the training in heightened virtue the training in heightened mind the training in heightened discernment then train in reference to those three trainings the training in heightened virtue the training in heightened mind the training in heightened discernment as you train in heightened virtue heightened mind heightened discernment your passion aversion delusion when trained in heightened virtue heightened mind heightened discernment will be abandoned you with the abandoning of passion the abandoning of aversion the abandoning of delusion will not do anything unskillful or engage in any evil later on that monk trained in reference to heightened virtue heightened mind heightened discernment his passion aversion delusion when trained in heightened virtue heightened mind heightened discernment were abandoned he with the abandoning of passion the abandoning of aversion the abandoning of delusion did not do anything unskillful or engage in any evil i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was journeying along a road in the kosalan country with ven n gasam la as his junior companion ven n gasam la while going along the road saw a fork in the path on seeing it he said to the blessed one that lord blessed one a second time a third time ven n gasam la said to the blessed one that lord blessed one is the route we go that way and for a third time the blessed one said this n gasam la is the route we go this way then ven n gasam la placing the blessed one s bowl robes right there on the ground left saying this lord blessed one is the bowl robes then as ven n gasam la was going along that route thieves jumping out in the middle of the road pummeled him with their fists feet broke his bowl and ripped his outer robe to shreds so ven n gasam la with his bowl broken his outer robe ripped to shreds went to the blessed one and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one just now lord as i was going along that route thieves jumped out in the middle of the road pummeled me with their fists feet broke my bowl and ripped my outer robe to shreds then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed when traveling together mixed together with a person who doesn t know an attainer of wisdom on realizing that the person is evil abandons him as a milk feeding thus have i heard at one time the blessed one was residing in jetavana the monastery of anathapindika near savatthi at that time the blessed one having called all the bhikkhus together addressed them thus bhikkhus the bhikkhus answered in assent lord the bhikkhus then prepared themselves for the following teaching the blessed one then gave the following teaching on uposatha bhikkhus uposatha is comprised of eight factors which the ariyan disciple observes the observation of which brings glorious and radiant fruit and benefit bhikkhus what is the uposatha which observed by the ariyan disciples brings glorious and radiant fruit and benefit bhikkhus ariyan disciples in this religion reflect thus all arahants for as long as life lasts have given up the intentional taking of life all of you have given up the intentional taking of life have put down all weapons are possessed of shame of doing evil and are compassionate toward all beings for all of this day and night in this manner you will be known as having followed the arahants and the uposatha will have been observed by you this is the first factor of the uposatha bhikkhus ariyan disciples in this religion reflect thus all arahants for as long as life lasts have given up taking what has not been given all of you have given up the taking of what has not been given are ones who

east the west the north the south to lodge here nobles and brahmans merchants and serfs what monks are the states to be comprehended with higher knowledge they are the five groups of clinging which five the body group the feeling group the perception group the mental formation group the consciousness group what monks are the states to be abandoned with higher knowledge they are ignorance and the desire for further becoming and what monks are the states to be experienced with higher knowledge they are knowledge and liberation and what monk are the states to be cultivated with higher knowledge they are calm and insight and how does a monk who cultivates the noble eightfold path who assiduously practices the noble eightfold path comprehend abandon come to experience cultivate with higher knowledge those states that are to be so comprehended abandoned experienced cultivated in this monks a monk cultivates right view right concentration that is based on detachment dispassion leading to maturity of surrender on one occasion ven sariputta and ven maha kotthita were staying near varanasi in the game refuge at isipatana then in the evening ven sariputta emerged from his seclusion and went to ven maha kotthita and exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to ven maha kotthita now then friend kotthita does the tathagata exist after death that friend has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata exists after death well then friend kotthita does the tathagata not exist after death friend that too has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata does not exist after death then does the tathagata both exist and not exist after death that has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death well then does the tathagata neither exist nor not exist after death that too has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death now friend kotthita when asked if the tathagata exists after death you say that has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata exists after death when asked if the tathagata does not exist after death both exists and does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death you say that too has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death now what is the cause what is the reason why that has not been declared by the blessed one i the aggregates for one who loves form who is fond of form who cherishes form who does not know or see as it actually is present the cessation of form there occurs the thought the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death for one who loves feeling for one who loves perception for one who loves fabrications for one who loves consciousness who is fond of consciousness who cherishes consciousness who does not know or see as it actually is present the cessation of consciousness there occurs the thought the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death but for one who doesn t love form who isn t fond of form who doesn t cherish form who knows sees as it actually is present the cessation of form the thought the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death doesn t occur for one who doesn t love feeling for one who doesn t love perception for one who doesn t love fabrication for one who doesn t love consciousness who isn t fond of consciousness who doesn t cherish consciousness who knows sees as it actually is present the cessation of consciousness the thought the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death doesn t occur this is the cause this is the reason why that has not been declared by the blessed one ii becoming but my friend would there another line of reasoning in line with which that has not been declared by the blessed one there would my friend for one who loves becoming who is fond of becoming who cherishes becoming who does not know or see as it actually is present the cessation of becoming there occurs the thought the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death but for one who doesn t love becoming who isn t fond of becoming who doesn t cherish becoming who knows sees as it actually is present the cessation of becoming the thought the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death doesn t occur this too is a line of reasoning in line with which that has not been declared by the blessed one iii clinging sustenance but my friend would there another line of reasoning in line with which that has not been declared by the blessed one there would my friend for one who loves clinging sustenance who is fond of clinging sustenance who cherishes clinging sustenance who does not know or see as it actually is present the cessation of clinging sustenance there occurs the thought the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death but for one who doesn t love clinging sustenance who isn t fond of clinging sustenance who doesn t cherish clinging sustenance who knows sees as it actually is present the cessation of clinging sustenance the thought the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death doesn t occur this too is a line of reasoning in line with which that has not been declared by the blessed one iv craving but my friend would there another line of reasoning in line with which that has not been declared by the blessed one there would my friend for one who loves craving who is fond of craving who cherishes craving who does not know or see as it actually is present the cessation of craving there occurs the thought the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death but for one who doesn t love craving who isn t fond of craving who doesn t cherish craving who knows sees as it actually is present the cessation of craving the thought the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death doesn t occur this too is a line of reasoning in line with which that has not been declared by the blessed one but my friend would there another line of reasoning in line with which that has not been declared by the blessed one now what more do you want friend kotthita when a monk has been freed from the classification of craving there exists no cycle for describing him i have heard that at one time the blessed one was staying in yes lord the monks responded to him the blessed one said i will teach analyze for you the origination and subsiding of the four establishings of mindfulness listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded to him the blessed one said and what monks is the origination of the body from the origination of contact is the origination of feeling from the cessation of contact is the subsiding of feeling from the origination of name form is the origination of the mind from the cessation of name form is the cessation of the mind from the origination of attention is the origination of mental qualities thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living in the abode of alavaka the yakkha demon at alavi then alavaka approached the blessed one and said get out recluse samana very well friend so saying the blessed one went out come in recluse very well friend so saying the blessed one entered get out recluse said alavaka to the blessed one a second time very well friend so saying the blessed one went out come in recluse very well friend so saying the blessed one entered get out recluse said alavaka to the blessed one a third time very well friend so saying the blessed one went out come in recluse very well friend so saying the blessed one entered get out recluse said alavaka to the blessed one a fourth time no o friend i will not get out do what you will i will ask you a question recluse if you do not answer me i will confound your mind thoughts or cleave your heart or take you by your feet and fling you over to the further shore of the ocean well friend i do not see anyone in the world of then alavaka addressed the blessed one in verse what wealth here is best for man what well practiced will happiness bring what taste excels all other tastes how lived is the life they say is best having thus spoken alavaka said to the blessed one most excellent o gotama is thy teaching most excellent just as a man would set upright what is overturned reveal what is concealed point out the way to one gone astray bring an oil lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes could see objects even so the dhamma doctrine has been declared in many a manner by the venerable gotama i take refuge in the venerable gotama the buddha in the dhamma and in the sangha the order may the venerable gotama accept me as a disciple who has taken refuge from this day forth while life lasts the buddha alavaka the buddha alavaka the buddha samanasbrahmanas alavaka at savatthi for a monk practicing the dhamma in accordance with the dhamma what accords with the dhamma is this that he keep focused on stress with regard to form that he keep focused on stress with regard to feeling that he keep focused on stress with regard to perception that he keep focused on stress with regard to fabrications that he keep focused on stress with regard to consciousness as he keeps focusing on stress with regard to form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he comprehends form feeling perception fabrications consciousness as he comprehends form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he is totally released from form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he is totally released from sorrows lamentations pains distresses despairs he is totally released i tell you from suffering stress setting at savatthi then in the morning the bhikkhuni cala dressed she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day s abiding then mara the evil one approached the bhikkhuni cala and said to her what don t you approve of bhikkhuni i don t approve of birth friend then mara the evil one realizing the bhikkhuni cala knows me sad and disappointed disappeared right there mara cala wise mindful you should develop immeasurable concentration i e concentration based on immeasurable good will compassion appreciation or equanimity when wise mindful one has developed immeasurable concentration five realizations arise right within oneself which five the realization arises right within oneself that this concentration is blissful in the present and will result in bliss in the future the realization arises right within oneself that this concentration is noble not connected with the baits of the flesh the realization arises right within oneself that this concentration is not obtained by base people the realization arises right within oneself that this concentration is peaceful exquisite the acquiring of serenity the attainment of unity not kept in place by the fabrications of forceful restraint the realization arises right within oneself that i enter into this concentration mindfully and mindfully i emerge from it wise mindful you should develop immeasurable concentration when wise mindful one has developed immeasurable concentration these five realizations arise right within oneself at one time the now what friend s riputta is the pleasant and what is the painful rebirth friend is painful non rebirth is pleasant when friend there is rebirth this pain is to be expected cold and heat hunger and thirst excrement and urine contact with fire contact with punishment contact with weapons and anger caused by meeting and associating with relatives and friends when friend there is rebirth this pain is to be expected when friend there is no rebirth this pleasantness is to be expected neither cold nor heat neither hunger nor thirst neither excrement nor urine neither contact with fire nor contact with punishment nor contact with weapons and no anger caused by meeting and associating with relatives and friends when friend there is no rebirth this pleasantness is to be expected there are these five ways of subduing hatred by which when hatred arises in a monk he should wipe it out completely which five when one gives birth to hatred for an individual one should develop good will for that individual thus the hatred for that individual should be subdued when one gives birth to hatred for an individual one should develop compassion for that individual thus the hatred for that individual should be subdued when one gives birth to hatred for an individual one should develop equanimity toward that individual thus the hatred for that individual should be subdued when one gives birth to hatred for an individual one should pay him no mind pay him no attention thus the hatred for that individual should be subdued when one gives birth to hatred for an individual one should direct one s thoughts to the fact of his being the product of his actions this venerable one is the doer of his actions heir to his actions born of his actions related by his actions and has his actions as his arbitrator whatever action he does for good or for evil to that will he fall heir thus the hatred for that individual should be subdued these are five ways of subduing hatred by which when hatred arises in a monk he should wipe it out completely i will teach you the penetrative explanation that is a dhamma explanation listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said and which penetrative explanation is a dhamma explanation sensuality should be known the cause by which sensuality comes into play should be known the diversity in sensuality should be known the result of sensuality should be known the cessation of sensuality should be known the path of practice for the cessation of sensuality should be known feeling should be known the cause by which feeling comes into play should be known the diversity in feeling should be known the result of feeling should be known the cessation of feeling should be known the path of practice for the cessation of feeling should be known perception should be known the cause by which perception comes into play should be known the diversity in perception should be known the result of perception should be known the cessation of perception should be known the path of practice for the cessation of perception should be known fermentations kamma should be known the cause by which kamma comes into play should be known the diversity in kamma should be known the result of kamma should be known the cessation of kamma should be known the path of practice for the cessation of kamma should be known stress should be known the cause by which stress comes into play should be known the diversity in stress should be known the result of stress should be known the cessation of stress should be known the path of practice for the cessation of stress should be known there are these five strings of sensuality which five forms cognizable via the eye agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing sounds cognizable via the ear aromas cognizable via the nose flavors cognizable via the tongue tactile sensations cognizable via the body agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing but these are not sensuality they are called strings of sensuality in the discipline of the noble ones and what is the cause by which sensuality comes into play contact is the cause by which sensuality comes into play and what is the diversity in sensuality sensuality with regard to forms is one thing sensuality with regard to sounds is another sensuality with regard to aromas is another sensuality with regard to flavors is another sensuality with regard to tactile sensations is another this is called the diversity in sensuality and what is the result of sensuality one who wants sensuality produces a corresponding state of existence on the side of merit or demerit this is called the result of sensuality and what is the cessation of sensuality from the cessation of contact is the cessation of sensuality and just this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration is the way leading to the cessation of sensuality now when a disciple of the noble ones discerns sensuality in this way the cause by which sensuality comes into play in this way the diversity of sensuality in this way the result of sensuality in this way the cessation of sensuality in this way the path of practice leading to the cessation of sensuality in this way then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of sensuality sensuality should be known the cause by which sensuality comes into play the diversity in sensuality the result of sensuality the cessation of sensuality the path of practice for the cessation of sensuality should be known thus it has been said and in reference to this was it said there are these three kinds of feeling a feeling of pleasure a feeling of pain feeling of neither pleasure nor pain and what is the cause by which feeling comes into play contact is the cause by which feeling comes into play and what is the diversity in feeling there is the feeling of pleasure connected with the baits of the world there is the feeling of pleasure not connected with the baits of the world there is the feeling of pain connected with the baits of the world there is the feeling of pain not connected with the baits of the world there is the feeling of neither pleasure nor pain connected with the baits of the world there is the feeling of neither pleasure nor pain not connected with the baits of the world this is called the diversity in feeling and what is the result of feeling one who feels a feeling produces a corresponding state of existence on the side of merit or demerit this is called the result of feeling and what is the cessation of feeling from the cessation of contact is the cessation of feeling and just this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration is the way leading to the cessation of feeling now when a disciple of the noble ones discerns feeling in this way the cause by which feeling comes into play in this way the diversity of feeling in this way the result of feeling in this way the cessation of feeling in this way the path of practice leading to the cessation of feeling in this way then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of feeling feeling should be known the cause by which feeling comes into play the diversity in feeling the result of feeling the cessation of feeling the path of practice for the cessation of feeling should be known thus it has been said and in reference to this was it said there are these six kinds of perception and what is the cause by which perception comes into play contact is the cause by which perception comes into play and what is the diversity in perception perception with regard to forms is one thing perception with regard to sounds is another perception with regard to aromas is another perception with regard to flavors is another perception with regard to tactile sensations is another perception with regard to ideas is another this is called the diversity in perception and what is the result of perception perception has expression as its result i tell you however a person perceives something that is how he expresses it i have this sort of perception this is called the result of perception and what is the cessation of perception from the cessation of contact is the cessation of perception and just this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration is the way leading to the cessation of perception now when a disciple of the noble ones discerns perception in this way the cause by which perception comes into play in this way the diversity of perception in this way the result of perception in this way the cessation of perception in this way the path of practice leading to the cessation of perception in this way then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of perception perception should be known the cause by which perception comes into play the diversity in perception the result of perception the cessation of perception the path of practice for the cessation of perception should be known thus it has been said and in reference to this was it said there are these three kinds of fermentations the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignorance and what is the cause by which fermentations come into play ignorance is the cause by which fermentations come into play and what is the diversity in fermentations there are fermentations that lead to hell those that lead to the animal womb those that lead to the realm of the hungry shades those that lead to the human world those that lead to the world of the devas this is called the diversity in fermentations and what is the result of fermentations one who is immersed in ignorance produces a corresponding state of existence on the side of merit or demerit this is called the result of fermentations and what is the cessation of fermentations from the cessation of ignorance is the cessation of fermentations and just this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations now when a disciple of the noble ones discerns fermentations in this way the cause by which fermentations come into play in this way the diversity of fermentations in this way the result of fermentations in this way the cessation of fermentations in this way the path of practice leading to the cessation of fermentations in this way then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of fermentations fermentations should be known the cause by which fermentations come into play the diversity in fermentations the result of fermentations the cessation of fermentations the path of practice for the cessation of fermentations should be known thus it has been said and in reference to this was it said intention i tell you is kamma intending one does kamma by way of body speech intellect and what is the cause by which kamma comes into play contact is the cause by which kamma comes into play and what is the diversity in kamma there is kamma to be experienced in hell kamma to be experienced in the realm of common animals kamma to be experienced in the realm of the hungry shades kamma to be experienced in the human world kamma to be experienced in the world of the devas this is called the diversity in kamma and what is the result of kamma the result of kamma is of three sorts i tell you that which arises right here now that which arises later in this lifetime and that which arises following that this is called the result of kamma and what is the cessation of kamma from the cessation of contact is the cessation of kamma and just this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration is the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma now when a disciple of the noble ones discerns kamma in this way the cause by which kamma comes into play in this way the diversity of kamma in this way the result of kamma in this way the cessation of kamma in this way the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma in this way then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of kamma kamma should be known the cause by which kamma comes into play the diversity in kamma the result of kamma the cessation of kamma the path of practice for the cessation of kamma should be known thus it has been said and in reference to this was it said birth is stress aging is stress death is stress sorrow lamentation pain distress despair are stress association with the unbeloved is stress separation from the loved is stress not getting what is wanted is stress in short the five clinging aggregates are stress and what is the cause by which stress comes into play craving is the cause by which stress comes into play and what is the diversity in stress there is major stress minor slowly fading quickly fading this is called the diversity in stress and what is the result of stress there are some cases in which a person overcome with pain his mind exhausted grieves mourns laments beats his breast becomes bewildered or one overcome with pain his mind exhausted comes to search outside who knows a way or two to stop this pain i tell you monks that stress results either in bewilderment or in search this is called the result of stress and what is the cessation of stress from the cessation of craving is the cessation of stress and just this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress now when a disciple of the noble ones discerns stress in this way the cause by which stress comes into play in this way the diversity of stress in this way the result of stress in this way the cessation of stress in this way the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress in this way then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of stress stress should be known the cause by which stress comes into play the diversity in stress the result of stress the cessation of stress the path of practice for the cessation of stress should be known thus it was said and in reference to this was it said and this is the penetrative explanation that is a dhamma explanation the i have heard that on one occasion direct your mind to where you used to live among the devas of the thirty three empowered with all sensual pleasures honored surrounded by deva maidens you will shine ven anuruddha jalini they ven anuruddha thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the headman if i were to teach you the origination ending of stress with reference to the past saying thus it was in the past you would be doubtful and perplexed if i were to teach you the origination ending of stress with reference to the future saying thus it will be in the future you would be doubtful and perplexed so instead i sitting right here will teach you sitting right there the origination ending of stress listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord gandhabhaka the headman replied the blessed one said now what do you think headman are there any people in uruvelakappa who if they were murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would cause sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair to arise in you yes lord there are people in uruvelakappa who if they were murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would cause sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair to arise in me and are there any people in uruvelakappa who if they were murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would cause no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair to arise in you yes lord there are people in uruvelakappa who if they were murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would cause no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair to arise in me now what is the cause what is the reason why the murder imprisonment fining or censure of some of the people in uruvelakappa would cause you sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair whereas the murder imprisonment fining or censure of others would cause you no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair those people in uruvelakappa whose murder imprisonment fining or censure would cause me sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair are those for whom i feel desire passion those people in uruvelakappa whose murder imprisonment fining or censure would cause me no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair are those for whom i feel no desire or passion now headman from what you have realized fathomed attained right now in the present without regard to time you may draw an inference with regard to the past and future whatever stress in arising arose for me in the past all of it had desire as its root had desire as its cause for desire is the cause of stress and whatever stress in arising will arise for me in the future all of it will have desire as the root will have desire as its cause for desire is the cause of stress amazing lord stupendous how well the blessed one has put it whatever stress in arising arose for me in the past all of it had desire as its root had desire as its cause for desire is the cause of stress and whatever stress in arising will arise for me in the future all of it will have desire as the root will have desire as its cause for desire is the cause of stress now headman what do you think if ciravasi were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would you feel sorrow lamentation pain distress despair lord if my son ciravasi were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured my very life would be altered so how could i not feel sorrow lamentation pain distress despair thus headman by this line of reasoning it may be realized how stress when arising arises all of it has desire as its root has desire as its cause for desire is the cause of stress now what do you think headman before you had seen or heard of ciravasi s mother did you feel desire passion or love for her no lord and after you had seen or heard of ciravasi s mother did you feel desire passion or love for her yes lord what do you think if ciravasi s mother were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would you feel sorrow lamentation pain distress despair lord if ciravasi s mother were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured my very life would be altered so how could i not feel sorrow lamentation pain distress despair thus headman by this line of reasoning it may be realized how stress when arising arises all of it has desire as its root has desire as its cause for desire is the cause of stress thus have i heard once the exalted one was dwelling at anathapindika s monastery in the jeta grove near savatthi now when the night was far spent a certain deity whose surpassing splendor illuminated the entire jeta grove came to the presence of the exalted one and drawing near respectfully saluted him and stood at one side standing thus he addressed the exalted one in verse i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was wandering on a tour of as you say lord the monks responded then as he was wandering by stages in kasi the blessed one eventually arrived at a kasi town called kitagiri and there he stayed in the kasi town kitagiri now at that time the monks led by when this was said the monks led by assaji punabbasu said to those monks friends we eat in the evening in the morning in the wrong time during the day as we are eating in the evening in the morning in the wrong time during the day we sense next to no illness next to no affliction lightness strength a comfortable abiding why should we abandoning what is immediately visible chase after something subject to time we will eat in the evening in the morning in the wrong time during the day when they were unable to convince the monks led by assaji punabbasu those monks went to the blessed one and told him what had happened then the blessed one told a certain monk come monk in my name call the monks led by assaji punabbasu saying the teacher calls you friends as you say lord the monk answered and having gone to the monks led by assaji punabbasu on arrival he said the teacher calls you friends as you say friend the monks led by assaji punabbasu replied then they went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there the blessed one said to them is it true monks that a large number of monks went to you and you said why should we abandoning what is immediately visible chase after something subject to time we will eat in the evening in the morning in the wrong time during the day yes lord monks have you ever understood me to teach the dhamma in this way whatever a person experiences pleasant painful or neither pleasant nor painful his unskillful qualities decrease and his skillful qualities grow no lord and haven t you understood me to teach the dhamma in this way for someone feeling a pleasant feeling of this sort unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decrease but there is the case where for someone feeling a pleasant feeling of that sort unskillful qualities decrease and skillful qualities grow for someone feeling a painful feeling of this sort unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decrease but there is the case where for someone feeling a painful feeling of that sort unskillful qualities decrease and skillful qualities grow for someone feeling a neither pleasant nor painful feeling of this sort unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decrease but there is the case where for someone feeling a neither pleasant nor painful feeling of that sort unskillful qualities decrease and skillful qualities grow yes lord good monks and if it were not known by me not seen not observed not realized not touched through discernment that for someone feeling a pleasant feeling of this sort unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decrease then would it be fitting for me not knowing that to say abandon that sort of pleasant feeling no lord but because it is known by me seen observed realized touched through discernment that for someone feeling a pleasant feeling of this sort unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decrease i therefore say abandon that sort of pleasant feeling if it were not known by me not seen not observed not realized not touched through discernment that for someone feeling a pleasant feeling of this sort unskillful qualities decrease and skillful qualities grow then would it be fitting for me not knowing that to say enter remain in that sort of pleasant feeling no lord but because it is known by me seen observed realized touched through discernment that for someone feeling a pleasant feeling of this sort unskillful qualities decrease and skillful qualities grow i therefore say enter remain in that sort of pleasant feeling monks i don t say of all monks that they have a task to do with heedfulness nor do i say of all monks that they have no task to do with heedfulness monks who are arahants whose mental fermentations are ended who have reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who are released through right gnosis i don t say of them that they have work to do with heedfulness why is that they have done their task with heedfulness they are incapable of being heedless but as for monks in higher training who have not yet reached their hearts goal who still aspire for the unexcelled freedom from bondage i say of them that they have a task to do with heedfulness why is that i think perhaps these venerable ones when making use of suitable resting places associating with admirable friends balancing their mental faculties monks there are these seven individuals to be found in the world which seven one released both ways one released through discernment a bodily witness one attained to view one released through conviction a dhamma follower and a conviction follower and what is the individual released both ways there is the case where a certain individual remains touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form that are formless and having seen with discernment his fermentations are ended this is called an individual released both ways and what is the individual released through discernment there is the case where a certain individual does not remain touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form that are formless but having seen with discernment his fermentations are ended this is called an individual who is released through discernment and what is the individual who is a bodily witness there is the case where a certain individual remains touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form that are formless and having seen with discernment some of his fermentations are ended this is called an individual who is a bodily witness and what is the individual attained to view there is the case where a certain individual does not remain touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form that are formless but having seen with discernment some of his fermentations are ended and he has reviewed examined with discernment the qualities and what is the individual released through conviction there is the case where a certain individual does not remain touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form that are formless but having seen with discernment some of his fermentations are ended and his conviction in the tathagata is settled rooted and established this is called an individual who is released through conviction and what is the individual who is a dhamma follower there is the case where a certain individual does not remain touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form that are formless nor having seen with discernment are his fermentations ended but with a sufficient measure of reflection through discernment he has come to an agreement with the teachings proclaimed by the tathagata and he has these qualities the faculty of conviction the faculty of persistence the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of discernment this is called an individual who is a dhamma follower and what is the individual who is a conviction follower there is the case where a certain individual does not remain touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form that are formless nor having seen with discernment are his fermentations ended but he has a sufficient measure of conviction in love for the tathagata and he has these qualities the faculty of conviction the faculty of persistence the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of discernment this is called an individual who is a conviction follower regarding this monk i say that he has a task to do with heedfulness why is that i think perhaps this venerable one when making use of suitable resting places associating with admirable friends balancing his mental faculties will reach remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing realizing it for himself in the here now envisioning this fruit of heedfulness for this monk i say that he has a task to do with heedfulness monks i do not say that the attainment of gnosis is all at once rather the attainment of gnosis is after gradual training gradual action gradual practice and how is there the attainment of gnosis after gradual training gradual action gradual practice there is the case where when conviction has arisen one visits a teacher having visited one grows close having grown close one lends ear having lent ear one hears the dhamma having heard the dhamma one remembers it remembering one penetrates the meaning of the teachings penetrating the meaning one comes to an agreement through pondering the teachings there being an agreement through pondering the teachings desire arises when desire has arisen one is willing when one is willing one contemplates having contemplated one makes an exertion having made an exertion one realizes with the body the ultimate truth and having penetrated it with discernment sees it now monks there hasn t been that conviction there hasn t been that visiting there hasn t been that growing close that lending ear that hearing of the dhamma that remembering that penetration of the meaning of the teachings that agreement through pondering the teachings that desire that willingness that contemplation that exertion you have lost the way monks you have gone the wrong way monks how far have you strayed foolish men from this dhamma discipline monks there is a four phrased statement that when it is recited a wise man will in no long time learn the meaning through discernment i will recite it and you learn it from me but lord who are we to be learners of the dhamma monks even with a teacher devoted to material things an heir of material things who lives attached to material things this sort of haggling by his students wouldn t be proper if we get this we ll do it if we don t we won t so how could it be with regard to the tathagata who dwells entirely detached from material things for a disciple who has conviction in the teacher s message lives to penetrate it what accords with the dhamma is this the blessed one is the teacher i am a disciple he is the one who knows not i for a disciple who has conviction in the teacher s message lives to penetrate it the teacher s message is healing nourishing for a disciple who has conviction in the teacher s message lives to penetrate it what accords with the dhamma is this gladly would i let the flesh blood in my body dry up leaving just the skin tendons bones but if i have not attained what can be reached through human firmness human persistence human striving there will be no relaxing my persistence for a disciple who has conviction in the teacher s message lives to penetrate it one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis here now or if there be any remnant of clinging sustenance non return that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words pingiya the buddha pingiya the buddha i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near then mara the evil one went to the blessed one and recited this verse in his presence are you lying there in a stupor or drunk on poetry are your goals so very few all alone in a secluded lodging what is this dreamer this sleepy face then mara the evil one sad dejected at realizing the blessed one knows me the one well gone knows me vanished right there the buddha there are these a having a single perception of form internally one sees forms externally as limited beautiful ugly mastering them one has the perception i know i see this is the first dimension of mental mastery b having a single perception of form internally one sees forms externally as immeasurable beautiful ugly mastering them one has the perception i know i see this is the second dimension of mental mastery c having a single formless perception internally one sees forms externally as limited beautiful ugly mastering them one has the perception i know i see this is the third dimension of mental mastery d having a single formless perception internally one sees forms externally as immeasurable beautiful ugly mastering them one has the perception i know i see this is the fourth dimension of mental mastery e having a single formless perception internally one sees forms externally as blue blue in their color blue in their features blue in their glow just as a flax flower is blue blue in its color blue in its features blue in its glow or just as benares muslin smooth on both sides is blue blue in its color blue in its features blue in its glow in the same way having a single formless perception internally one sees forms externally as blue blue in their color blue in their features blue in their glow mastering them one has the perception i know i see this is the fifth dimension of mental mastery f having a single formless perception internally one sees forms externally as yellow yellow in their color yellow in their features yellow in their glow just as a kannikara flower is yellow yellow in its color yellow in its features yellow in its glow or just as benares muslin smooth on both sides is yellow yellow in its color yellow in its features yellow in its glow in the same way having a single formless perception internally one sees forms externally as yellow yellow in their color yellow in their features yellow in their glow mastering them one has the perception i know i see this is the sixth dimension of mental mastery g having a single formless perception internally one sees forms externally as red red in their color red in their features red in their glow just as a bandha jivaka flower is red red in its color red in its features red in its glow or just as benares muslin smooth on both sides is red red in its color red in its features red in its glow in the same way having a single formless perception internally one sees forms externally as red red in their color red in their features red in their glow mastering them one has the perception i know i see this is the seventh dimension of mental mastery h having a single formless perception internally one sees forms externally as white white in their color white in their features white in their glow just as the morning star is white white in its color white in its features white in its glow or just as benares muslin smooth on both sides is white white in its color white in its features white in its glow in the same way having a single formless perception internally one sees forms externally as white white in their color white in their features white in their glow mastering them one has the perception i know i see this is the eighth dimension of mental mastery these are the eight dimensions of mental mastery now of these eight dimensions of mastery this is supreme when having a single formless perception internally one sees forms externally as white white in their color white in their features white in their glow and there are beings who are percipient in this way yet even in the beings who are percipient in this way there is still aberration there is change seeing this the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with that being disenchanted with that he becomes dispassionate toward what is supreme and even more so toward what is inferior thus have i heard at one time the lord was staying near savatthi in the eastern park at migara s mother s mansion on that occasion the lord was sitting surrounded by the order of bhikkhus as it was the day of the uposatha observance then when the night was far advanced and the first watch had ended the venerable ananda arose from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his folded hands and said to the lord the night is far advanced revered sir the first watch has ended and the bhikkhus have been sitting for a long time revered sir let the lord recite the patimokkha to the bhikkhus when this was said the lord remained silent when the night was still further advanced and the middle watch had ended a second time the venerable ananda arose from his seat and said to the lord the night is far advanced revered sir the middle watch has ended and the bhikkhus have been sitting for a long time revered sir let the lord recite the patimokkha to the bhikkhus a second time the lord remained silent when the night was yet further advanced and the last watch had ended as dawn was approaching and the night was drawing to a close a third time the venerable ananda arose from his seat and said to the lord the night is far advanced revered sir the last watch has ended dawn is approaching and the night is drawing to a close and the bhikkhus have been sitting for a long time revered sir let the lord recite the patimokka to the bhikkhus the gathering is not pure ananda then the venerable mahamoggallana thought concerning which person has the lord said the gathering is not pure ananda and the venerable mahamoggallana comprehending the minds of the whole order of bhikkhus with his own mind saw that person sitting in the midst of the order of bhikkhus immoral wicked of impure and suspect behavior secretive in his acts no recluse though pretending to be one not practicing the holy life though pretending to do so rotten within lustful and corrupt on seeing him he arose from his seat approached that person and said get up friend you are seen by the lord you cannot live in communion with the bhikkhus but that person remained silent a second time and a third time the venerable mahamoggallana told that person to get up and a second time and a third time that person remained silent then the venerable mahamoggllana took that person by the arm pulled him outside the gate and bolted it then he approached the lord and said revered sir i have ejected that person the assembly is quite pure revered sir let the lord recite the patimokkha to the bhikkhus it is strange moggallana it is remarkable moggallana how that stupid person should have waited until he was taken by the arm then the lord addressed the bhikkhus from now on bhikkhus i shall not participate in the uposatha observance or recite the patimokkha from now on you yourselves should participate in the uposatha observance and recite the patimokkha it is impossible bhikkhus it cannot happen that the tathagata should participate in the uposatha observance and recite the patimokkha with a gathering that is not pure bhikkhus there are these eight wonderful and marvellous qualities of the great ocean seeing which the asuras delight in the great ocean what are the eight the great ocean bhikkhus gradually shelves slopes and inclines and there is no sudden precipice since the great ocean gradually shelves this is the first wonderful and marvellous quality of the great ocean seeing which the asuras delight in the great ocean furthermore the great ocean is stable and does not exceed the limits of the tide line this is the second wonderful and marvellous quality of the great ocean furthermore the great ocean does not tolerate a dead body for when there is a dead body in the great ocean it soon conveys it to the shore and casts it up on dry land this is the third wonderful and marvellous quality of the great ocean furthermore whatever great rivers there are the ganges the yamuna the aciravati the sarabhu and the mahi on reaching the great ocean lose their former names and identities and are just called the great ocean this is the fourth wonderful and marvellous quality of the great ocean furthermore although the rivers of the world flow into the great ocean and showers of rain fall from the sky no lessening or filling up of the great ocean is evident this is the fifth wonderful and marvellous quality of the great ocean furthermore the great ocean has one taste the taste of salt this is the sixth wonderful and marvellous quality of the great ocean furthermore the great ocean contains many precious substances various precious substances such as these pearl crystal beryl conch quartz coral silver gold ruby and cat s eye this is the seventh wonderful and marvellous quality of the great ocean furthermore the great ocean is the abode of mighty creatures of such creatures as these the timi timingala timirapingala asuras nagas and gandhabbas there exist in the great ocean beings a hundred yojanas in size beings two hundred three hundred four hundred and five hundred yojanas in size this is the eighth wonderful and marvellous quality of the great ocean these bhikkhus are the eight wonderful and marvellous qualities of the great ocean seeing which the asuras delight in the great ocean similarly bhikkhus there are eight wonderful and marvellous qualities in this dhamma and discipline seeing which bhikkhus delight in this dhamma and discipline what are the eight just as the great ocean gradually shelves slopes and inclines and there is no sudden precipice so also in this dhamma and discipline there is a gradual training a gradual course a gradual progression and there is no sudden penetration to final knowledge since in this dhamma and discipline there is a gradual training this is the first wonderful and marvellous quality in this dhamma and discipline seeing which bhikkhus delight in this dhamma and discipline just as the great ocean is stable and does not exceed the limits of the tide line so also my disciples do not transgress a training rule laid down by me for disciples even for the sake of their lives this is the second wonderful and marvellous quality in this dhamma and discipline just as the great ocean does not tolerate a dead body and casts it up on dry land so also whatsoever person is immoral wicked of impure and suspect behavior secretive in his acts no recluse though pretending to be one not practicing the holy life though pretending to do so rotten within lustful and corrupt the order does not associate with him but when it has met together soon throws him out even though he may be sitting in the midst of the order of bhikkhus yet he is far from the order and the order is far from him this is the third wonderful and marvellous quality in this dhamma and discipline just as whatever great rivers there are on reaching the great ocean lose their former names and identities and are just called the great ocean so also those of the four castes nobles brahmans merchants and workers having gone forth from home to the homeless state in the dhamma and discipline made known by the tathagata abandon their former names and identities and are just called recluses the followers of the sakyan son this is the fourth wonderful and marvellous quality in this dhamma and discipline just as although the rivers of the world flow into the great ocean and showers of rain fall from the sky no lessening or filling up of the great ocean is evident so also although many bhikkhus attain final nibbana in the nibbana element with no residue left no lessening or filling up of the nibbana element is evident this is the fifth wonderful and marvellous quality in this dhamma and discipline just as the great ocean has one taste the taste of salt so also this dhamma and discipline has one taste the taste of liberation this is the sixth wonderful and marvellous quality in this dhamma and discipline just as the great ocean contains many precious substances various precious substances so also this dhamma and discipline contains many precious things various precious things such as these the four foundations of mindfulness the four right endeavors the four bases for successful accomplishment the five faculties the five powers the seven enlightenment factors and the noble eightfold path this is the seventh wonderful and marvellous quality in this dhamma and discipline just as the great ocean is the abode of mighty creatures so also this dhamma and discipline is the abode of mighty creatures such as these the stream enterer and the one who is on the way to realizing the fruit of stream entry the once returner and the one who is on the way to realizing the fruit of once returning the non returner and the one who is on the way to realizing the fruit of non returning the arahant and the one who is on the way to arahatship this is the eighth wonderful and marvellous quality in this dhamma and discipline these bhikkhus are the eight wonderful and marvellous qualities in this dhamma and discipline seeing which bhikkhus delight in this dhamma and discipline then on realizing its significance the lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance rain soddens what is covered up it does not sodden what is open therefore uncover what is covered that the rain will not sodden it i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near don t say that friend don t slander the blessed one for it s not good to slander the blessed one the blessed one would not say that bodily action is barren verbal action is barren only mental action is true but there is friend an attainment in which on being attained nothing is felt how long has it been friend samiddhi since you went forth into homelessness not long friend three years then what now should i say about the elder monks when a junior monk would suppose that his teacher is to be defended in this way having intentionally done an action with body with speech or with mind what does one experience having intentionally done an action with body with speech or with mind one experiences stress then potaliputta the wanderer neither delighted in nor scorned ven samiddhi s words neither delighting nor scorning he got up from his seat and left then not long after potaliputta the wanderer had left ven samiddhi went to as you say friend ven samiddhi responded to ven nanda so ven samiddhi and ven nanda went to the blessed one and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one side as they were sitting there ven nanda reported to the blessed one the entirety of the discussion between ven samiddhi and potaliputta the wanderer when this was said the blessed one said i do not recall even having seen potaliputta the wanderer much less having that sort of discussion and his question which deserved an analytical answer has been given a categorical answer by this worthless man samiddhi when this was said when this was said the blessed one said to ven nanda look nanda at how this worthless ud yin interrupts i knew just now that he would interrupt in an inappropriate way from the very beginning potaliputta the wanderer was asking about the three kinds of feeling when this worthless samiddhi was asked by him in this way he should have answered having intentionally done with body with speech or with mind an action that is to be felt as pleasure one experiences pleasure having intentionally done with body with speech or with mind an action that is to be felt as pain one experiences pain having intentionally done with body with speech or with mind an action that is to be felt as neither pleasure nor pain one experiences neither pleasure nor pain answering this way this worthless samiddhi would have rightly answered potaliputta the wanderer but then who this is the time o blessed one this is the time o one well gone for the blessed one to analyze the greater analysis of action having heard the blessed one the monks will bear it in mind in that case nanda listen and pay close attention i will speak as you say lord ven nanda responded to the blessed one the blessed one said nanda there are four kinds of person to be found in the world which four there is the case where a certain person is one who takes life takes what is not given steals engages in illicit sex lies speaks divisively speaks abusively engages in idle chatter is covetous malevolent holds wrong view with the breakup of the body after death he reappears in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hell but there is also the case where a certain person is one who takes life takes what is not given steals engages in illicit sex lies speaks divisively speaks abusively engages in idle chatter is covetous malevolent holds wrong view yet with the breakup of the body after death he reappears in a good destination a heavenly world and there is the case where a certain person is one who abstains from taking life abstains from taking what is not given abstains from illicit sex abstains from lying abstains from speaking divisively abstains from speaking abusively abstains from idle chatter is not covetous not malevolent holds right view with the breakup of the body after death he reappears in a good destination a heavenly world but there is also the case where a certain person is one who abstains from taking life abstains from taking what is not given abstains from illicit sex abstains from lying abstains from speaking divisively abstains from speaking abusively abstains from idle chatter is not covetous not malevolent holds right view yet with the breakup of the body after death he reappears in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hell there is the case nanda where a certain contemplative or brahman through ardency exertion commitment heedfulness right attention touches the sort of concentration of awareness that when his mind is thus concentrated he sees with the divine eye pure and surpassing the human that person the case where one who takes life takes what is not given steals engages in illicit sex lies speaks divisively speaks abusively engages in idle chatter is covetous malevolent holds wrong view with the breakup of the body after death has reappeared in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hell he says so there really are evil actions there really is the result of misconduct for i saw the case where a person who took life held wrong view with the breakup of the body after death has reappeared in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hell he says anyone who takes life hold wrong view they all on the breakup of the body after death reappear in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hell whoever knows this knows rightly whoever knows otherwise their knowledge is wrong insisting through obstinacy grasping right there on what was seen by himself known by himself understood by himself he states only this is true everything otherwise is worthless then there is the case nanda where a certain contemplative or brahman through ardency exertion commitment heedfulness right attention touches the sort of concentration of awareness that when his mind is thus concentrated he sees with the divine eye pure and surpassing the human that person the case where one who takes life takes what is not given

one who abstains from taking life abstains from taking what is not given abstains from illicit sex abstains from lying abstains from speaking divisively abstains from speaking abusively abstains from idle chatter is not covetous not malevolent holds right view with the breakup of the body after death reappears in a good destination a heavenly world he says so there really are fine actions there really is the result of good conduct for i saw the case where a person who abstained from taking life held right view with the breakup of the body after death has reappeared in a good destination a heavenly world he says anyone who abstains from taking life holds right view they all on the breakup of the body after death reappear in a good destination a heavenly world whoever knows this knows

whoever knows this knows rightly whoever knows otherwise their knowledge is wrong insisting through obstinacy grasping right there on what was seen by himself known by himself understood by himself he states only this is true everything otherwise is worthless now nanda in the case where the contemplative or brahman says so there really are evil actions there really is the result of misconduct i allow him that when he says for i saw the case where a person who took life held wrong view with the breakup of the body after death has reappeared in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hell i allow him that too but when he says anyone who takes life hold wrong view they all on the breakup of the body after death reappear in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower

right there on what was seen by himself known by himself understood by himself he states only this is true everything otherwise is worthless i don t allow him that either why is that because the tath

apparently effectual there is action that is both effectual and apparently effectual there is action that is effectual but apparently ineffectual that is what the blessed one said gratified ven nanda delighted in the blessed one s words for a discussion of this discourse as an example of an analytical answer to a question see monks there are these and what is bodily sagacity there is the case where a monk abstains from taking life abstains from theft abstains from unchastity this is called bodily sagacity and what is verbal sagacity there is the case where a monk abstains from lying abstains from divisive tale bearing abstains from harsh language abstains from idle chatter this is called verbal sagacity and what is mental sagacity there is the case where a monk who with the wasting away of the mental fermentations remains in the fermentation free awareness release and discernment release having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here and now this is called mental sagacity these monks are the three forms of sagacity a sage in body a sage in speech a sage in mind without fermentation a sage consummate in sagacity is said to have abandoned everything the all dwelling at the knowledge of ending in the presence of ending has its prerequisite i tell you it is not without a prerequisite and what is the prerequisite for the knowledge of ending release it should be said release has its prerequisite i tell you it is not without a prerequisite and what is its prerequisite dispassion disenchantment knowledge vision of things as they actually are present concentration pleasure serenity rapture joy conviction stress birth becoming clinging craving feeling contact the thus fabrications have ignorance as their prerequisite consciousness has fabrications as its prerequisite name form has consciousness as its prerequisite the six sense media have name form as their prerequisite contact has the six sense media as its

as they actually are present as its prerequisite dispassion has disenchantment as its prerequisite release has dispassion as its prerequisite knowledge of ending has release as its prerequisite i have heard that at one time the blessed one was staying at yes lord the monks replied the blessed one said mindfulness of death when developed pursued is of great fruit great benefit it gains a footing in the deathless has the deathless as its final end therefore you should develop mindfulness of death when this was said a certain monk addressed the blessed one i already develop mindfulness of death and how do you develop mindfulness of death i think o that i might live for a day night that i might attend to the blessed one s instructions i would have accomplished a great deal this is how i develop mindfulness of death then another monk addressed the blessed one i too already develop mindfulness of death and how do you develop mindfulness of death i think o that i might live for a day that i might attend to the blessed one s instructions i would have accomplished a great deal this is how i develop mindfulness of death then another monk addressed the blessed one i too develop mindfulness of death i think o that i might live for the interval that it takes to eat a meal that i might attend to the blessed one s instructions i would have accomplished a great deal then another monk addressed the blessed one i too develop mindfulness of death i think o that i might live for the interval that it takes to swallow having chewed up four morsels of food that i might attend to the blessed one s instructions i would have accomplished a great deal then another monk addressed the blessed one i too develop mindfulness of death i think o that i might live for the interval that it takes to swallow having chewed up one morsel of food that i might attend to the blessed one s instructions i would have accomplished a great deal then another monk addressed the blessed one i too develop mindfulness of death i think o that i might live for the interval that it takes to breathe out after breathing in or to breathe in after breathing out that i might attend to the blessed one s instructions i would have accomplished a great deal this is how i develop mindfulness of death when this was said the blessed one addressed the monks whoever develops mindfulness of death thinking o that i might live for a day night for a day for the interval that it takes to eat a meal for the interval that it takes to swallow having chewed up four morsels of food that i might attend to the blessed one s instructions i would have accomplished a great deal they are said to dwell heedlessly they develop mindfulness of death slowly for the sake of ending the effluents but whoever develops mindfulness of death thinking o that i might live for the interval that it takes to swallow having chewed up one morsel of food for the interval that it takes to breathe out after breathing in or to breathe in after breathing out that i might attend to the blessed one s instructions i would have accomplished a great deal they are said to dwell heedfully they develop mindfulness of death acutely for the sake of ending the effluents therefore you should train yourselves we will dwell heedfully we will develop mindfulness of death acutely for the sake of ending the effluents that is how you should train yourselves that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words at one time the lord was staying near savatthi at jeta grove anathapindika s monastery then king pasenadi of kosala approached the lord and having done so paid his respects and sat down nearby now at that time queen mallika died a certain man then approached the king and whispered in his ear your majesty queen mallika has died at those words king pasenadi was filled with grief and depression and with shoulders drooping head down he sat glum and with nothing to say the lord saw the king sitting there like that and spoke to him in this way great king there are these five circumstances not to be got by monk brahman deva mara brahma or by anyone in the world what are the five that what is of the nature to decay may not decay is a circumstance not to be got by a monk or by anyone in the world that what is of the nature to be diseased may not be diseased is a circumstance not to be got by a monk or by anyone in the world that what is of the nature to die may not die is a circumstance not to be got by a monk or by anyone in the world that what is of the nature to be exhausted may not be exhausted is a circumstance not to be got by a monk or by anyone in the world that what is of the nature to be destroyed may not be destroyed is a circumstance not to be got by a monk or by anyone in the world great king for an uninstructed ordinary person what is of the nature to decay does decay what is of the nature to be diseased does become diseased what is of the nature to die does die what is of the nature to be exhausted is exhausted and what is of the nature to be destroyed is destroyed and when these things happen to him he does not reflect it s not only for me that what is of the nature to decay decays that what is of the nature to be destroyed is destroyed but wherever there are beings coming and going dying and being born for all those beings what is of the nature to decay decays what is of the nature to be destroyed is destroyed and if i when there is decay in what is of the nature to decay when there is destruction in what is of the nature to be destroyed should grieve pine and lament and crying beat the breast and so fall into delusion food would not be enjoyed my body would become haggard work would not be done and enemies would be pleased while friends would be depressed then when there is decay in what is of the nature to decay disease in what is of the nature to be diseased death in what is of the nature to die exhaustion in what is of the nature to be exhausted destruction in what is of the nature to be destroyed he grieves pines and laments and crying beats his breast and so falls into delusion this is called an uninstructed ordinary person pierced by the poisoned dart of grief he just torments himself great king for the instructed noble disciple what is of the nature to decay does decay and what is of the nature to be destroyed is destroyed and when these things happen to him he does reflect it s not only for me that what is of the nature to decay decays that what is of the nature to be destroyed is destroyed but wherever there are beings coming and going dying and being born for all those beings what is of the nature to decay decays what is of the nature to be destroyed is destroyed and if i when there is decay in what is of the nature to decay when there is destruction in what is of the nature to be destroyed should grieve pine and lament and crying beat the breast and so fall into delusion food would not be enjoyed my body would become haggard work would not be done and enemies would be pleased while friends would be depressed then when there is decay in what is of the nature to decay disease in what is of the nature to be diseased death in what is of the nature to die exhaustion in what is of the nature to be exhausted destruction in what is of the nature to be destroyed he does not grieve or pine or lament he does not beat his breast and fall into delusion this is called an instructed noble disciple drawn out is the poisoned dart of grief with which the uninstructed ordinary person torments himself free of grief free from the dart the noble disciple has quenched himself completely great king these are the five circumstances not to be got by monk brahman deva mara brahma or by anyone in the world do not grieve nor should you lament here what good is gained none at all indeed and enemies rejoice to see that grief and pain but when misfortunes do not shake the wise that one who knows well how to seek the good then enemies because of that are pained seeing his face as formerly not strained where and whatever good may gotten be there and just there he should try for that by study wisdom and well spoken words unpracticed so far and tradition too but if he knows this good can be got neither by me nor any other too then ungrieving he should bear it all and think now how to use my strength for present work seeing how behaving how is one said to be at peace gotama tell me about when asked about the ultimate person the buddha beforethe end in between he he he monks i will teach you new old kamma the cessation of kamma and the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma listen and pay close attention i will speak now what monks is old kamma the eye is to be seen as old kamma fabricated willed capable of being felt the ear the nose the tongue the body the intellect is to be seen as old kamma fabricated willed capable of being felt this is called old kamma and what is new kamma whatever kamma one does now with the body with speech or with the intellect this is called new kamma and what is the cessation of kamma whoever touches the release that comes from the cessation of bodily kamma verbal kamma mental kamma this is called the cessation of kamma so monks i have taught you new old kamma the cessation of kamma and the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma whatever a teacher should do seeking the welfare of his disciples out of sympathy for them that have i done for you over there are the roots of trees over there empty dwellings practice jhana monks don t be heedless don t later fall into regret this is our message to you at savatthi monks craving for forms is inconstant changeable alterable

heard that on one occasion in that case householder i will question you in return answer as you see fit now what do you think those who teach a dhamma for the abandoning of passion for the abandoning of aversion for the abandoning of delusion is their dhamma well taught or not or how does this strike you sir those who teach a dhamma for the abandoning of passion for the abandoning of aversion for

taught those who have practiced for the abandoning of passion for the abandoning of aversion for the abandoning of delusion they have practiced well in this world those whose passion aversion delusion is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising they in this world are well gone how amazing sir how astounding that

your passion aversion delusion is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising you in this world are well gone the milindapa ha the eighteenth book of the composed around the beginning of the common era and of unknown authorship the milindapa ha is set up as a compilation of questions posed by king milinda to a revered senior monk named nagasena this milinda has been identified with considerable confidence by scholars as the greek king menander of bactria in the dominion founded by alexander the great which corresponds with much of present day afghanistan menander s realm thus would have included gandhara where buddhism was flourishing at that time what is most interesting about the milindapa ha is that it is the product of the encounter of two great civilizations hellenistic greece and buddhist india and is thus of continuing relevance as the wisdom of the east meets the modern western world king milinda poses questions about dilemmas raised by buddhist philosophy that we might ask today and nagasena s responses are full of wisdom wit and helpful analogies i see the pure the supreme free from disease it s in connection with what s seen that a person s purity is they jtb ao published this first paragraph in verse form at one time the buddha was residing in magadha near a place called andhakavinda at that time the buddha was seated under the open sky in the deep darkness of the night and the rain god was making it rain drop by drop then the brahma sahampati as the night was passing away lighting up andhakavinda with his surpassing brilliance approached the buddha and stood to one side as he stood to one side the brahma sahampati offered up these verses in the presence of the buddha let the wilderness serve for your seat and bed from fear and in the fearless released in places where frightening serpents abide lightning clashes and the rain god thunders in the blinding darkness of the deepest night there he sits the monk who s vanquished his dread let the wilderness serve for your seat and bed go about set free from the ties that bind but if perchance you don t find there your bliss then live in a group but watch over yourself mindful proceeding for alms from house to house mindful with guarded faculties and wise on one occasion brahman the blessed one the one who knows the one who sees worthy rightly self awakened has declared the level of one who is venerable and the level of one who is a youngster even if one is venerable years old yet if one partakes of sensuality lives in the midst of sensuality burns with sensual fever is chewed up by sensual thoughts and is eager in the search for sensuality then one is reckoned simply as a young fool not an elder but if one is a youngster youthful a black haired young person endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life yet does not partake of sensuality does not live in the midst of sensuality does not burn with sensual fever is not chewed up by sensual thoughts and is not eager in the search for sensuality then one is reckoned as a wise elder when this was said kandarayana the brahman rose up from his seat arranged his cloak over one shoulder and bowed down at the feet of the monks who were youngsters saying you sirs are the venerable ones standing on the level of those who are venerable we are the youngsters standing on the level of those who are youngsters magnificent master kaccana magnificent just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has master kaccana through many lines of reasoning made the dhamma clear i go to master gotama for refuge to the dhamma to the community of monks may master kaccana remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for life jtb the following preamble is traditionally included when this sutta is chanted although it does not appear in the tipitaka i have heard that at one time the blessed one was staying in savatthi at jeta s grove anathapindika s monastery there he addressed the monks saying monks yes lord the monks responded to him the blessed one said whether or not there is the arising monks whether or not there is the arising of tathagatas this property stands this steadfastness of the dhamma this orderliness of the dhamma all processes are inconstant the tathagata directly awakens to that breaks through to that directly awakening breaking through to that he declares it teaches it describes it sets it forth he reveals it explains it makes it plain all processes are inconstant whether or not there is the arising of tathagatas this property stands this steadfastness of the dhamma this orderliness of the dhamma all processes are stressful the tathagata directly awakens to that breaks through to that directly awakening breaking through to that he declares it teaches it describes it sets it forth he reveals it explains it makes it plain all processes are stressful whether or not there is the arising of tathagatas this property stands this steadfastness of the dhamma this orderliness of the dhamma all phenomena are not self the tathagata directly awakens to that breaks through to that directly awakening breaking through to that he declares it teaches it describes it sets it forth he reveals it explains it makes it plain all phenomena are not self jtb the following epilogue is traditionally included when this sutta is chanted although it does not appear in the tipitaka that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted at his words once the blessed one was staying near may what is subject to aging not age this is something that cannot be gotten by a contemplative a brahman a deva a mara a brahma or anyone at all in the world may what is subject to illness not grow ill this is something that cannot be gotten by a contemplative a brahman a deva a mara a brahma or anyone at all in the world may what is subject to death not die this is something that cannot be gotten by a contemplative a brahman a deva a mara a brahma or anyone at all in the world may what is subject to ending not end this is something that cannot be gotten by a contemplative a brahman a deva a mara a brahma or anyone at all in the world may what is subject to destruction not be destroyed this is something that cannot be gotten by a contemplative a brahman a deva a mara a brahma or anyone at all in the world now it happens to an uninstructed run of the mill person that something that is subject to aging ages with the aging of what is subject to aging he does not reflect it doesn t happen only to me that what is subject to aging will age to the extent that there are beings past future passing away re arising it happens to all of them that what is subject to aging will age and if with the aging of what is subject to aging i were to sorrow grieve lament beat my breast become distraught food would not agree with me my body would become unattractive my affairs would go untended my enemies would be gratified and my friends unhappy so with the aging of what is subject to aging he sorrows grieves laments beats his breast becomes distraught this is called an uninstructed run of the mill person pierced by the poisoned arrow of sorrow tormenting himself furthermore it happens to an uninstructed run of the mill person that something that is subject to illness grows ill that something subject to death dies that something subject to ending ends that something subject to destruction is destroyed with the destruction of what is subject to destruction he does not reflect it doesn t happen only to me that what is subject to destruction will be destroyed to the extent that there are beings past future passing away re arising it happens to

sorrows grieves laments beats his breast becomes distraught this is called an uninstructed run of the mill person pierced by the poisoned arrow of sorrow tormenting himself now it happens to a well instructed disciple of the noble ones that something that is subject to aging ages with the aging of what is subject to aging he reflects it doesn t happen only to me that what is subject to aging will age to the extent that there are beings past future passing away re arising it happens to all of them that what is subject to aging will age and if with the aging of what is subject to aging i were to sorrow grieve lament beat my breast become distraught food would not agree with me my body would become unattractive my affairs would go untended my enemies would be gratified and my friends unhappy so with the aging of what is subject to aging he does not sorrow grieve or lament does not beat his breast or become distraught this is called a well instructed disciple of the noble ones who has pulled out the poisoned arrow of sorrow pierced with which the uninstructed run of the mill person torments himself sorrowless arrowless the disciple of the noble ones is totally unbound right within himself furthermore it happens to a well instructed disciple of the noble ones that something that is subject to illness grows ill that something subject to death dies that something subject to ending ends that something subject to destruction is destroyed with the destruction of what is subject to destruction he reflects it doesn t happen only to me that what is subject to destruction will

instructed disciple of the noble ones who has pulled out the poisoned arrow of sorrow pierced with which the uninstructed run of the mill person torments himself sorrowless arrowless the disciple of the noble ones is totally unbound right within himself these are the five things great king that cannot be gotten by a contemplative a brahman a deva a mara a brahma or anyone at all in the world not by sorrowing not by lamenting is any aim accomplished here not even a bit knowing you re sorrowing in pain your enemies are gratified but when a sage with a sense for determining what is his aim doesn t waver in the face of misfortune his enemies are pained seeing his face unchanged as of old where however an aim is accomplished through eulogies chants good sayings donations family customs follow them diligently there that way but if you discern that your own aim or that of others is not gained in this way acquiesce to the nature of things unsorrowing with the thought what important work am i doing now monks these five future dangers unarisen at present will arise in the future be alert to them and being alert work to get rid of them which five there will be in the course of the future monks desirous of fine robes they desirous of fine robes will neglect the practice of wearing cast off cloth will neglect isolated forest and wilderness dwellings will move to towns cities and royal capitals taking up residence there for the sake of a robe they will do many kinds of unseemly inappropriate things this monks is the first future danger unarisen at present that will arise in the future be alert to it and being alert work to get rid of it furthermore in the course of the future there will be monks desirous of fine food they desirous of fine food will neglect the practice of going for alms will neglect isolated forest and wilderness dwellings will move to towns cities and royal capitals taking up residence there and searching out the tip top tastes with the tip of the tongue for the sake of food they will do many kinds of unseemly inappropriate things this monks is the second future danger unarisen at present that will arise in the future be alert to it and being alert work to get rid of it furthermore in the course of the future there will be monks desirous of fine lodgings they desirous of fine lodgings will neglect the practice of living in the wilds will neglect isolated forest and wilderness dwellings will move to towns cities and royal capitals taking up residence there for the sake of lodgings they will do many kinds of unseemly inappropriate things this monks is the third future danger unarisen at present that will arise in the future be alert to it and being alert work to get rid of it furthermore in the course of the future there will be monks who will live in close association with nuns female probationers and female novices as they interact with nuns female probationers and female novices they can be expected either to lead the holy life dissatisfied or to fall into one of the grosser offenses leaving the training returning to a lower way of life this monks is the fourth future danger unarisen at present that will arise in the future be alert to it and being alert work to get rid of it furthermore in the course of the future there will be monks who will live in close association with monastery attendants and novices as they interact with monastery attendants and novices they can be expected to live intent on storing up all kinds of possessions and to stake out crops and fields this monks is the fifth future danger unarisen at present that will arise in the future be alert to it and being alert work to get rid of it these monks are the five future dangers unarisen at present that will arise in the future be alert to them and being alert work to get rid of them i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the now at that time yes lord there are many resting places prepared in kala khemaka the sakyan s dwelling many monks live there our time for making robes has come around ananda a monk does not shine if he delights in company enjoys company is committed to delighting in company if he delights in a group enjoys a group rejoices in a group indeed ananda it is impossible that a monk who delights in company enjoys company is committed to delighting in company who delights in a group enjoys a group rejoices in a group will obtain at will without difficulty without trouble the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of self awakening but it is possible that a monk who lives alone withdrawn from the group can expect to obtain at will without difficulty without trouble the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of self awakening indeed ananda it is impossible that a monk who delights in company enjoys company is committed to delighting in company who delights in a group enjoys a group rejoices in a group will enter remain in the awareness release that is temporary and pleasing or in the awareness release that is not temporary and beyond provocation but it is possible that a monk who lives alone withdrawn from the group can expect to enter remain in the awareness release that is temporary and pleasing or in the awareness release that is not temporary and beyond provocation ananda i do not envision even a single form whose change alteration would not give rise to sorrow lamentation pain distress despair in one who is passionate for it and takes delight in it but there is this mental dwelling discovered by the tathagata where not attending to any themes he enters remains in internal emptiness if while he is dwelling there by means of this dwelling he is visited by monks nuns lay men lay women kings royal ministers sectarians their disciples then with his mind bent on seclusion tending toward seclusion inclined toward seclusion aiming at seclusion relishing renunciation having destroyed those qualities that are the basis for mental fermentation he converses with them only as much as is necessary for them to take their leave so ananda if a monk should wish may i enter remain in internal emptiness then he should get the mind steadied right within settled unified concentrated and how does the monk get the mind steadied right within settled unified concentrated there is the case where a monk quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful qualities enters remains in the first jhana the second jhana the third jhana the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain that is how a monk gets the mind steadied right within settled unified concentrated he attends to internal emptiness while he is attending to internal emptiness his mind does not take pleasure find satisfaction grow steady or indulge in internal emptiness when this is the case he discerns while i am attending to internal emptiness my mind does not take pleasure find satisfaction grow steady or indulge in internal emptiness in this way he is alert there he attends to external emptiness he attends to internal external emptiness he attends to the imperturbable when that is the case he should get the mind steadied right within settled unified concentrated in his first theme of concentration he then attends to internal emptiness while he is attending to internal emptiness his mind takes pleasure finds satisfaction grows steady indulges in internal emptiness when this is the case he discerns while i am attending to internal emptiness my mind takes pleasure finds satisfaction grows steady indulges in internal emptiness in this way he is alert there he attends to external emptiness he attends to internal external emptiness he attends to the imperturbable while he is attending to the imperturbable his mind takes pleasure finds satisfaction grows steady indulges in the imperturbable when this is the case he discerns while i am attending to the imperturbable my mind takes pleasure finds satisfaction grows steady indulges in the imperturbable in this way he is alert there if while the monk is dwelling by means of this dwelling his mind inclines to walking back forth he walks back forth thinking while i am walking thus no covetousness or sadness no evil unskillful qualities will take possession of me in this way he is alert there if while he is dwelling by means of this dwelling his mind inclines to standing to sitting to lying down he lies down thinking while i am lying down thus no covetousness or sadness no evil unskillful qualities will take possession of me in this way he is alert there if while he is dwelling by means of this dwelling his mind inclines to speaking he resolves that i will not engage in talk that is base vulgar common ignoble unbeneficial that does not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation calm direct knowledge self awakening or unbinding i e talk about kings robbers ministers of state armies alarms battles food drink clothing furniture garlands scents relatives vehicles villages towns cities the countryside women heroes the gossip of the street the well tales of the dead tales of diversity the creation of the world of the sea talk of whether things exist or not in this way he is alert there but he resolves i will engage in talk that is scrupulous conducive to release of awareness and leads exclusively to disenchantment dispassion cessation calm direct knowledge self awakening unbinding i e talk on modesty contentment seclusion non entanglement arousing persistence virtue concentration discernment release and the knowledge vision of release in this way he is alert there if while he is dwelling by means of this dwelling his mind inclines to thinking he resolves that i will not think thoughts that are base vulgar common ignoble unbeneficial that do not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation calm direct knowledge self awakening or unbinding i e thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will thoughts of harmfulness in this way he is alert there but he resolves i will think thoughts that are noble onward leading that lead to the right ending of stress for the person who acts on them i e thoughts of renunciation thoughts of no ill will thoughts of harmlessness in this way he is alert there there are these five clinging aggregates where a monk should stay keeping track of arising passing away thus such is form such its origination such its disappearance such is feeling such is perception such are fabrications such is consciousness such its origination such its disappearance as he stays keeping track of arising passing away with regard to these five clinging aggregates he abandons any conceit that i am with regard to these five clinging aggregates this being the case he discerns i have abandoned any conceit that i am with regard to these five clinging aggregates in this way he is alert there these qualities ananda are exclusively skillful in their grounding noble transcendent inaccessible to the evil one what do you think ananda when envisioning what aim is it proper for a disciple to follow after the teacher even when being rebuked for us lord the teachings have the blessed one as their root their guide their arbitrator it would be good if the blessed one himself would explicate the meaning of this statement having heard it from the blessed one the monks will remember it ananda it s not proper for a disciple to follow after the teacher to hear discourses verses or catechisms why is that for a long time ananda have you listened to the teachings retained them discussed them accumulated them examined them with your mind and penetrated them well in terms of your views but as for talk that is scrupulous conducive to release of awareness and leads exclusively to disenchantment dispassion cessation calm direct knowledge self awakening unbinding i e talk on modesty contentment seclusion non entanglement arousing persistence virtue concentration discernment release and the knowledge vision of release it s for the sake of hearing talk of this sort that it is proper for a disciple to follow after the teacher as if yoked to him this being the case there is the teacher s undoing there is the student s undoing there is the undoing of one who leads the holy life and how is there the teacher s undoing there is the case where a certain teacher and how is there the student s undoing a student of that teacher imitating his teacher s seclusion resorts to a secluded dwelling a wilderness the shade of a tree a heap of straw while he is living thus secluded brahmans householders from town countryside visit him when they visit him he gets smitten with things that infatuate falls into greed and reverts to luxury this is called a student undone with a student s undoing he has been struck down by evil unskillful qualities that defile that lead to further becoming are troublesome ripen in pain and lead to future birth aging death such is the student s undoing and how is there the undoing of one who leads the holy life there is the case where a tathagata arises in the world worthy and rightly self awakened consummate in knowledge conduct well gone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the teacher of divine human beings awakened blessed he resorts to a secluded dwelling a wilderness the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a forest grove the open air a heap of straw while he is living thus secluded brahmans householders from town countryside visit him when they visit him he doesn t get smitten with things that infatuate doesn t fall into greed doesn t revert to luxury a student of that teacher imitating his teacher s seclusion resorts to a secluded dwelling a wilderness the shade of a tree a heap of straw while he is living thus secluded brahmans householders from town countryside visit him when they visit him he gets smitten with things that infatuate falls into greed and reverts to luxury this is called one following the holy life who is undone with the undoing of one who leads the holy life he has been struck down by evil unskillful qualities that defile that lead to further becoming are troublesome ripen in pain and lead to future birth aging death such is the undoing of one who leads the holy life and in this regard ananda the undoing of one who leads the holy life ripens in more pain more bitterness than the teacher s undoing or the student s undoing it leads even to the states of deprivation therefore ananda engage with me in friendliness and not in opposition that will be for your long term well being happiness and how do students engage with the teacher in opposition and not in friendliness there is the case where a teacher teaches the dhamma to his students sympathetically seeking their well being out of sympathy this is for your well being this is for your happiness his disciples do not listen or lend ear or apply their minds to gnosis turning aside they stray from the teacher s message this is how students engage with the teacher as opponents and not as friends and how do students engage with the teacher in friendliness and not in opposition there is the case where a teacher teaches the dhamma to his students sympathetically seeking their well being out of sympathy this is for your well being this is for your happiness his disciples listen lend ear apply their minds to gnosis not turning aside they don t stray from the teacher s message this is how students engage with the teacher as friends and not as opponents therefore ananda engage with me in friendliness and not in opposition that will be for your long term well being happiness i won t hover over you like a potter over damp unbaked clay goods scolding again again i will speak urging you on again again i will speak whatever is of essential worth will remain that is what the blessed one said gratified ven ananda delighted in the blessed one s words monks these nine perceptions when developed pursued are of great fruit of great benefit they gain a footing in the deathless and have the deathless as their final end which nine the perception of unattractiveness of the body the perception of death the perception of the foulness in food the perception of no delight in any world the perception of inconstancy the perception of stress in inconstancy the perception of not self in stress the perception of abandoning the perception of dispassion these nine perceptions when developed pursued are of great fruit of great benefit they gain a footing in the deathless and have the deathless as their final end tissa metteyya the buddha at and why do you call it form and why do you call it feeling because it feels thus it is called feeling what does it feel it feels pleasure it feels pain it feels neither pleasure nor pain because it feels it is called feeling and why do you call it perception because it perceives thus it is called perception what does it perceive it perceives blue it perceives yellow it perceives red it perceives white because it perceives it is called perception and why do you call them fabrications because they fabricate fabricated things thus they are called fabrications what do they fabricate as a fabricated thing for the sake of form ness they fabricate form as a fabricated thing for the sake of feeling ness they fabricate feeling as a fabricated thing for the sake of perception hood for the sake of fabrication hood for the sake of consciousness hood they fabricate consciousness as a fabricated thing because they fabricate fabricated things they are called fabrications and why do you call it consciousness because it cognizes thus it is called consciousness what does it cognize it cognizes what is sour bitter pungent sweet alkaline non alkaline salty unsalty because it cognizes it is called consciousness thus an instructed disciple of the noble ones reflects in this way i am now being chewed up by form but in the past i was also chewed up by form in the same way i am now being chewed up by present form and if i delight in future form then in the future i will be chewed up by form in the same way i am now being chewed up by present form having reflected in this way he becomes indifferent to past form does not delight in future form and is practicing for the sake of disenchantment dispassion and cessation with regard to present form he reflects i am now being chewed up by feeling perception fabrications consciousness but in the past i was also chewed up by consciousness in the same way i am now being chewed up by present consciousness and if i delight in future consciousness then in the future i will be chewed up by consciousness in the same way i am now being chewed up by present consciousness having reflected in this way he becomes indifferent to past consciousness does not delight in future consciousness and is practicing for the sake of disenchantment dispassion and cessation with regard to present consciousness what do you think monks is form constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord is feeling constant or inconstant inconstant lord is perception constant or inconstant inconstant lord are fabrications constant or inconstant inconstant lord what do you think monks is consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord thus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am any feeling whatsoever any perception whatsoever any fabrications whatsoever any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am this monks is called a disciple of the noble ones who tears down and does not build up who abandons and does not cling who discards and does not pull in who scatters and does not pile up and what does he tear down and not build up he tears down form and does not build it up he tears down feeling perception fabrications consciousness and does not build it up and what does he abandon and not cling to he abandons form and does not cling to it he abandons feeling perception fabrications consciousness and does not cling to it and what does he discard and not pull in he discards form and does not pull it in he discards feeling perception fabrications consciousness and does not pull it in and what does he scatter and not pile up he scatters form and does not pile it up he scatters feeling perception fabrications consciousness and does not pile it up seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness disenchanted he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is fully released with full release there is the knowledge fully released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world this monks is called a disciple of the noble ones who neither builds up nor tears down but who stands having torn down who neither clings nor abandons but who stands having abandoned who neither pulls in nor discards but who stands having discarded who neither piles up nor scatters but who stands having scattered and what is it that he neither builds up nor tears down but stands having torn it down he neither builds up nor tears down form but stands having torn it down he neither builds up nor tears down feeling perception fabrications consciousness but stands having torn it down and what is it that he neither clings to nor abandons but stands having abandoned it he neither clings to nor abandons form but stands having abandoned it he neither clings to nor abandons feeling perception fabrications consciousness but stands having abandoned it and what is it that he neither pulls in nor discards but stands having discarded it he neither pulls in nor discards form but stands having discarded it he neither pulls in nor discards feeling perception fabrications consciousness but stands having discarded it and what is it that he neither piles up nor scatters but stands having scattered it he neither piles up nor scatters form but stands having scattered it he neither piles up nor scatters feeling perception fabrications consciousness but stands having scattered it and to the monk whose mind is thus released the devas together with homage to you o thoroughbred man homage to you o superlative man you of whom we don t know even what dependent on which you re absorbed monks these four types of kamma have been directly realized verified made known by me which four there is kamma that is dark with dark result there is kamma that is bright with bright result there is kamma that is dark bright with dark bright result there is kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither dark nor bright result leading to the ending of kamma and what is kamma that is dark with dark result there is the case where a certain person fabricates an injurious bodily fabrication fabricates an injurious verbal fabrication fabricates an injurious mental fabrication having fabricated an injurious bodily fabrication having fabricated an injurious verbal fabrication having fabricated an injurious mental fabrication he rearises in an injurious world on rearising in an injurious world he is there touched by injurious contacts touched by injurious contacts he experiences feelings that are exclusively painful like those of the beings in hell this is called kamma that is dark with dark result and what is kamma that is bright with bright result there is the case where a certain person fabricates a non injurious bodily fabrication a non injurious verbal fabrication a non injurious mental fabrication he rearises in a non injurious world there he is touched by non injurious contacts he experiences feelings that are exclusively pleasant like those of the beautiful black devas this is called kamma that is bright with bright result and what is kamma that is dark bright with dark bright result there is the case where a certain person fabricates a bodily fabrication that is injurious non injurious a verbal fabrication that is injurious non injurious a mental fabrication that is injurious non injurious he rearises in an injurious non injurious world there he is touched by injurious non injurious contacts he experiences injurious non injurious feelings pleasure mingled with pain like those of human beings some devas and some beings in the lower realms this is called kamma that is dark bright with dark bright result and what is kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither dark nor bright result leading to the ending of kamma right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration this is called kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither dark nor bright result leading to the ending of kamma these monks are the four types of kamma directly realized verified made known by me the monk who subdues his arisen anger as with herbs snake venom once it has spread sloughs off the near shore far as a snake its decrepit old skin the monk who has cut off passion without leaving a trace as he would plunging into a lake a lotus sloughs off the near shore far as a snake its decrepit old skin the monk who has cut off craving without leaving a trace as if he had dried up a swift flowing stream sloughs off the near shore far as a snake its decrepit old skin the monk who has demolished conceit without leaving a trace as a great flood a very weak bridge made of reeds sloughs off the near shore far as a snake its decrepit old skin the monk seeing in states of becoming no essence as he would when surveying a fig tree no flowers sloughs off the near shore far as a snake its decrepit old skin the monk with no inner anger who has thus gone beyond becoming not sloughs off the near shore far as a snake its decrepit old skin the monk whose discursive thoughts are dispersed well dealt with inside without leaving a trace sloughs off the near shore far as a snake its decrepit old skin the monk who hasn t slipped past or turned back transcending all this objectification sloughs off the near shore far as a snake its decrepit old skin the monk who hasn t slipped past or turned back knowing with regard to the world that all this is unreal sloughs off the near shore far as a snake its decrepit old skin the monk who hasn t slipped past or turned back without greed as all this is unreal sloughs off the near shore far as a snake its decrepit old skin the monk who hasn t slipped past or turned back without aversion as all this is unreal sloughs off the near shore far as a snake its decrepit old skin the monk who hasn t slipped past or turned back without delusion as all this is unreal sloughs off the near shore far as a snake its decrepit old skin the monk in whom there are no obsessions the roots of unskillfulness totally destroyed sloughs off the near shore far as a snake its decrepit old skin the monk in whom there s nothing born of distress that would lead him back to this shore sloughs off the near shore far as a snake its decrepit old skin the monk in whom there s nothing born of desire that would keep him bound to becoming sloughs off the near shore far as a snake its decrepit old skin the monk who s abandoned five hindrances who untroubled unwounded has crossed over doubt sloughs off the near shore far as a snake its decrepit old skin endowed with these five qualities a lay follower is an outcaste of a lay follower a stain of a lay follower a dregs of a lay follower which five he she does not have conviction in the buddha s awakening is unvirtuous is eager for protective charms ceremonies trusts protective charms ceremonies not kamma and searches for recipients of his her offerings outside of the sangha and gives offerings there first endowed with these five qualities a lay follower is an outcaste of a lay follower a stain of a lay follower a dregs of a lay follower endowed with these five qualities a lay follower is a jewel of a lay follower a lotus of a lay follower a fine flower of a lay follower which five he she has conviction is virtuous is not eager for protective charms ceremonies trusts kamma not protective charms ceremonies does not search for recipients of his her offerings outside of the sangha and gives offerings here first endowed with these five qualities a lay follower is a jewel of a lay follower a lotus of a lay follower a fine flower of a lay follower then there is the case sariputta where a certain person having gone to a brahman or contemplative makes him an offer tell me sir what you need in terms of the four requisites but he doesn t give what he offered if he passes away from there and comes here then whatever trade he engages in it turns out a failure then there is the case where a certain person having gone to a brahman or contemplative makes him an offer tell me sir what you need in terms of the four requisites but he gives him something other than what he intended by the offer if he passes away from there and comes here then whatever trade he engages in it turns out not as intended then there is the case where a certain person having gone to a brahman or contemplative makes him an offer tell me sir what you need in terms of the four requisites he gives him what he intended by the offer if he passes away from there and comes here then whatever trade he engages in it turns out as intended then there is the case where a certain person having gone to a brahman or contemplative makes him an offer tell me sir what you need in terms of the four requisites he gives him more than what he intended by the offer if he passes away from there and comes here then whatever trade he engages in it turns out better than intended this is the reason sariputta this is the cause why a certain trade when engaged in by some people turns out a failure why the same sort of trade when engaged in by other people turns out not as intended why the same sort of trade when engaged in by other people turns out as intended why the same sort of trade when engaged in by other people turns out better than intended ananda i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in jivaka when one has gone to the buddha for refuge has gone to the dhamma for refuge and has gone to the sangha for refuge then to that extent is one a lay follower and to what extent lord is one a virtuous lay follower jivaka when one abstains from taking life from stealing from sexual misconduct from lying and from fermented distilled drinks that lead to heedlessness then to that extent is one a virtuous lay follower and to what extent lord is one a lay follower who practices for his own benefit but not that of others jivaka when a lay follower himself is consummate in conviction but does not encourage others in the consummation of conviction when he himself is consummate in virtue but does not encourage others in the consummation of virtue when he himself is consummate in generosity but does not encourage others in the consummation of generosity when he himself desires to see the monks but does not encourage others to see the monks when he himself wants to hear the true dhamma but does not encourage others to hear the true dhamma when he himself habitually remembers the dhamma he has heard but does not encourage others to remember the dhamma they have heard when he himself explores the meaning of the dhamma he has heard but does not encourage others to explore the meaning of the dhamma they have heard when he himself knowing both the dhamma its meaning practices the dhamma in line with the dhamma but does not encourage others to practice the dhamma in line with the dhamma then to that extent he is a lay follower who practices for his own benefit but not for the benefit of others and to what extent lord is one a lay follower who practices both for his own benefit the benefit of others jivaka when a lay follower himself is consummate in conviction and encourages others in the consummation of conviction when he himself is consummate in virtue and encourages others in the consummation of virtue when he himself is consummate in generosity and encourages others in the consummation of generosity when he himself desires to see the monks and encourages others to see the monks when he himself wants to hear the true dhamma and encourages others to hear the true dhamma when he himself habitually remembers the dhamma he has heard and encourages others to remember the dhamma they have

practices the dhamma in line with the dhamma and encourages others to practice the dhamma in line with the dhamma then to that extent he is a lay follower who practices both for his own benefit and for the benefit of others i have heard that on one occasion having abandoned home living free from society the sage in villages creates no intimacies rid of sensual passions free from yearning he wouldn t engage with people in quarrelsome debate how is the detailed meaning of this the blessed one s brief statement to be understood ven maha kaccana the property of form householder is the home of consciousness when consciousness is in bondage through passion to the property of form it is said to be living at home the property of feeling perception fabrication is the home of consciousness when consciousness is in bondage through passion to the property of fabrication it is said to be dwelling at home and how does one not live at home any desire passion delight craving any attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases or obsessions with regard to the property of form any desire passion delight craving any attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases or obsessions with regard to the property of feeling perception fabrication any desire passion delight craving any attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases or obsessions with regard to the property of consciousness these the tathagata has abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising therefore the tathagata is said to be not dwelling at home and how does one live with society one who is in bondage to the distraction of the society of form impressions is said to be living in society one who is in bondage to the distraction of the society of sound impressions aroma impressions flavor impressions tactile sensation impressions idea impressions is said to be living in society this is how one lives with society and how does one live free from society the tathagata has abandoned bondage to the distraction of the society of form impressions its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising therefore the tathagata is said to be living free from society the tathagata has abandoned bondage to the distraction of the society of sound impressions aroma impressions flavor impressions tactile sensation impressions idea impressions its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising therefore the tathagata is said to be living free from society and how is one intimate in villages there is the case where a certain person lives entangled with householders delighting together with them sorrowing together with them happy when they are happy pained when they are pained he takes on any of their arisen business affairs as his own duty this is how one is intimate in villages and how is one not intimate in villages there is the case where a monk lives unentangled with householders not delighting together with them not sorrowing together with them not happy when they are happy not pained when they are pained he does not take on any of their arisen business affairs as his own duty this is how one is not intimate in villages and how is one not rid of sensual passions there is the case where a certain person is not free of passion for sensual pleasures not free of desire not free of love not free of thirst not free of fever not free of craving for sensual pleasures this is how one is not rid of sensual passions and how is one rid of sensual passions there is the case where a certain person is free of passion for sensual pleasures free of desire free of love free of thirst free of fever free of craving for sensual pleasures this is how one is rid of sensual passions and how does one have yearnings there is the case where a certain person thinks may form be like this in the future may feeling may perception may fabrication may consciousness be like this in the future this is how one has yearnings and how is one free from yearning there is the case where a certain person does not think may form be like this in the future may feeling may perception may fabrication may consciousness be like this in the future this is how one is free from yearning and how does one engage with people in quarrelsome debate there is the case where a certain person is a fomenter of this kind of debate and how does one not engage with people in quarrelsome debate there is the case where a certain person is not a fomenter of this kind of debate so householder what was said by the blessed one in magandiya s questions in the atthaka vagga having abandoned home living free from society the sage in villages creates no intimacies rid of sensual passions free from yearning he wouldn t engage with people in quarrelsome debate this is how the detailed meaning of this the blessed one s brief statement is to be understood my hut is roofed comfortable free of drafts my mind well centered set free i remain ardent so rain deva go ahead rain i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion the blessed one sat reflecting on the various evil unskillful qualities that had been abandoned in him and on the various skillful qualities that had gone to the culmination of their development then as he realized the various evil unskillful qualities that had been abandoned in him and the various skillful qualities that had gone to the culmination of their development he on that occasion exclaimed before it was then it wasn t before it wasn t then it was it wasn t won t be now isn t to be found i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion ven pi ola bh radv ja was sitting not far from the blessed one his legs crossed his body held erect a wilderness dweller an alms goer a rag robe wearer an owner of only one set of three robes modest content solitary unentangled his persistence aroused an advocate of the ascetic practices devoted to the heightened mind the blessed one saw ven pi ola bh radv ja sitting not far away his legs crossed his body held erect a wilderness dweller an alms goer a rag robe wearer an owner of only one set of three robes modest content solitary unentangled his persistence aroused an advocate of the ascetic practices devoted to the heightened mind then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed not disparaging not injuring restraint in line with the p imokkha moderation in food dwelling in seclusion commitment to the heightened mind this is the teaching of the awakened abandon what is unskillful monks it is possible to abandon what is unskillful if it were not possible to abandon what is unskillful i would not say to you abandon what is unskillful but because it is possible to abandon what is unskillful i say to you abandon what is unskillful if this abandoning of what is unskillful were conducive to harm and pain i would not say to you abandon what is unskillful but because this abandoning of what is unskillful is conducive to benefit and pleasure i say to you abandon what is unskillful develop what is skillful monks it is possible to develop what is skillful if it were not possible to develop what is skillful i would not say to you develop what is skillful but because it is possible to develop what is skillful i say to you develop what is skillful if this development of what is skillful were conducive to harm and pain i would not say to you develop what is skillful but because this development of what is skillful is conducive to benefit and pleasure i say to you develop what is skillful violence breeds misery having seen people struggling and contending with each other here follows the rule of training whatever are worldly fetters may you not be bound by them completely break down sensual desires and practice so as to realize nibbana for yourself a sage should be truthful not arrogant not deceitful not given to slandering others and should be without anger he should remove the evil of attachment and wrongly directed longing he should conquer drowsiness lassitude and sloth and not dwell in indolence a man whose mind is set on nibbana should not be arrogant he should not lapse into untruth nor generate love for sense objects he should thoroughly understand the nature of conceit and abstain from violence he should not delight in what is past nor be fond of what is new nor sorrow for what is disappearing nor crave for the attractive greed i say is a great flood it is a whirlpool sucking one down a constant yearning seeking a hold continually in movement having actually experienced and understood the dhamma he has realized the highest knowledge and is independent dry out that which is past to be not callous not greedy at rest and unruffled by circumstances that is the profitable result i proclaim when asked about one who does not waver for one who does not crave who has understanding there is no production of new kamma on one occasion yes friend the monks replied to him ven ananda said it is amazing friends it is marvelous how the blessed one who knows sees the worthy one rightly self awakened has attained recognized the opportunity for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow lamentation for the disappearance of pain distress for the attainment of the right method for the realization of unbinding where the eye will be and forms and yet one will not be sensitive to that dimension where the ear will be and sounds where the nose will be and aromas where the tongue will be and flavors where the body will be and tactile sensations and yet one will not be sensitive to that dimension when this was said ananda one is percipient when not sensitive to that dimension my friend not unpercipient udayin when not sensitive to that dimension my friend one is percipient of what ananda there is the case where with the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving infinite space one enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space this is one way of being percipient when not sensitive to that dimension then again with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space perceiving infinite consciousness one enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness this is another way of being percipient when not sensitive to that dimension then again with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness perceiving there is nothing one enters remains in the dimension of nothingness this is another way of being percipient when not sensitive to that dimension once friend when i was staying in i said to her sister the concentration whereby neither pressed down nor forced back nor with fabrication kept blocked or suppressed still as a result of release contented as a result of standing still and as a result of contentment one is not agitated this concentration is said by the blessed one to be the fruit of gnosis i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion ven bhaddiya the dwarf following behind a large number of monks was going to the blessed one from afar the blessed one saw ven bhaddiya the dwarf coming following behind a large number of monks ugly unsightly stunted treated with condescension yes lord that monks is a monk of great power great might the attainment already attained by that monk is not of a sort easily attained and by means of it he has reached remains in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing realizing it for himself right in the here now then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed faultless canopied in white the single spoked chariot rolls along see him coming untroubled one whose stream is cut free from bonds monks there are these four modes of practice which four intolerant practice tolerant practice self controlled practice and even practice and which is intolerant practice there is the case where a certain individual when insulted returns the insult when abused returns the abuse when bickered with bickers in return this is called intolerant practice and which is tolerant practice there is the case where a certain individual when insulted doesn t return the insult when abused doesn t return the abuse when bickered with doesn t bicker in return this is called tolerant practice and which is self controlled practice there is the case where a monk on seeing a form with the eye doesn t grasp at any theme or variations by which if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him he practices with restraint he guards the faculty of the eye he achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the eye on hearing a sound with the ear on smelling an aroma with the nose on tasting a flavor with the tongue on touching a tactile sensation with the body on cognizing an idea with the intellect he doesn t grasp at any theme or variations by which if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him he practices with restraint he guards the faculty of the intellect he achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the intellect this is called self controlled practice and which is even practice there is the case where a monk doesn t acquiesce to an arisen thought of sensuality he abandons it destroys it dispels it knows it demolishes it wipes it out of existence he doesn t acquiesce to an arisen thought of ill will he abandons it dispels it knows it demolishes it wipes it out of existence he doesn t acquiesce to an arisen thought of harmfulness he abandons it dispels it knows it demolishes it wipes it out of existence he doesn t acquiesce to any arisen evil unskillful qualities he abandons them dispels them knows them demolishes them wipes them out of existence this is called even practice these monks are four modes of practice and which is even practice there is the case where a monk doesn t acquiesce to an arisen thought of sensuality he abandons it destroys it dispels it knows it he doesn t acquiesce to an arisen thought of ill will he abandons it destroys it dispels it wipes it out of existence he doesn t acquiesce to an arisen thought of harmfulness he abandons it destroys it dispels it wipes it out of existence he doesn t acquiesce to any arisen evil unskillful qualities he abandons them destroys them dispels them wipes them out of existence this is called even practice these monks are four modes of practice the tathagata the worthy one the rightly self awakened one who from disenchantment with feeling perception fabrication from dispassion from cessation from lack of clinging the tathagata the worthy one the rightly self awakened one who from disenchantment with consciousness from dispassion from cessation from lack of clinging so what difference what distinction what distinguishing factor is there between one rightly self awakened and a monk discernment released for us lord the teachings have the blessed one as their root their guide their arbitrator it would be good if the blessed one himself would explicate the meaning of this statement having heard it from the blessed one the monks will remember it in that case monks listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said the tathagata the worthy one the rightly self awakened one is the one who gives rise to the path this is the difference this the distinction this the distinguishing between one rightly self awakened and a monk discernment released i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near savatthi in jeta s grove anathapindika s monastery there he addressed the monks monks yes lord the monks replied monks the thought occurs to them now what future danger concerning sensual pleasures do those other brahmans contemplatives foresee that they have spoken of the relinquishment of sensual pleasures and describe the full comprehension of sensual pleasures it s pleasant the touch of this woman wanderer s soft tender downy arm thus they meet with their downfall through sensual pleasures then having met with their downfall through sensual pleasures with the break up of the body after death they go to a bad bourn destitution the realm of the hungry shades hell there they experience sharp burning pains they say and then no peacock swallowed it no deer ate it no brush fire burned it up no woodsmen picked it up no termites carried it off and it really the thought occurred to the deva living in the sala tree now what future danger did my friends companions relatives kin garden devas forest devas tree devas devas living in herbs grass forest monarchs foresee in that maluva creeper seed that they gathered together to console me have no fear have no fear in all likelihood a peacock is sure to swallow this maluva creeper seed or a deer will eat it or a brush fire will burn it up or woodsmen will pick it up or termites will carry it off and anyway it probably isn t really a seed it s pleasant the touch of this maluva creeper s soft tender downy tendril then the creeper having enwrapped the sala tree having made a canopy over it cascading down around it caused the massive limbs of the sala tree to come crashing down the thought occurred to the deva living in the tree in the same way monks there are some brahmans contemplatives who hold to a doctrine a view like this there is no harm in sensual pleasures thus they meet with their downfall through sensual pleasures they consort with women wanderers who wear their hair coiled in a topknot the thought occurs to them now what future danger do those other brahmans contemplatives foresee that they teach the relinquishment analysis of sensual pleasures it s pleasant the touch of this woman wanderer s soft tender downy arm thus they meet with their downfall through sensual pleasures then having met with their downfall through sensual pleasures with the break up of the body after death they go to a bad bourn destitution the realm of the hungry shades hell there they experience sharp burning pains they say this is called the taking on of a practice that is pleasant in the present but yields pain in the future and what is the taking on of a practice that is painful in the present and yields pain in the future there is the case where someone is a cloth less this is called the taking on of a practice that is painful in the present and yields pain in the future and what is the taking on of a practice that is painful in the present but yields pleasure in the future there is the case of a person who is normally strongly passionate by nature and frequently experiences pain grief born of passion a person who is normally strongly aversive by nature and frequently experiences pain grief born of aversion a person who is normally strongly deluded by nature and frequently experiences pain grief born of delusion even though touched with pain grief crying with a tearful face he lives the holy life that is utterly perfect surpassingly pure with the break up of the body after death he reappears in the good bourn the heavenly world this is called the taking on of a practice that is painful in the present but yields pleasure in the future and what is the taking on of a practice that is pleasant in the present and yields pleasure in the future there is the case of a person who is not normally strongly passionate by nature and doesn t frequently experience pain grief born of passion who is not normally strongly aversive by nature and doesn t frequently experience pain grief born of aversion who is not normally strongly deluded by nature and doesn t frequently experience pain grief born of delusion quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress he enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain with the break up of the body after death he reappears in the good bourn the heavenly world this is called the taking on of a practice that is pleasant in the present and yields pleasure in the future and these are the four ways of taking on practices that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words the blessed one was once staying among the kurus at their market town of kammaasadamma do not say that aananda do not say that this law of dependent origination is indeed profound and appears profound it is through not knowing not understanding not penetrating this truth on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the so the brahman of the bharadvaja clan together with the youths went to the forest grove on arrival he saw the blessed one sitting in the grove his legs folded crosswise his body set straight mindfulness established to the fore on seeing him he went to the blessed one and on arrival addressed him in verse in the deep looking forest teeming with terrors having plunged into the wilderness desolate empty unflinchingly steadfastly compellingly you practice jhana monk how very lovely you look where no song is sung where no music is played alone in the wilderness the forest dwelling sage this looks amazing to me that you live alone in the forest with rapturous mind i suppose it s in longing for the three heavens unexcelled in the company of the ruling lord of the worlds that staying here in the wilderness desolate you practice austerities for attaining brahma the buddha i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near r jagaha at the bamboo grove the squirrels refuge now at on that occasion ven pilindavaccha went around addressing the monks as if they were outcastes so a large number of monks went to the blessed one and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one side as they were sitting there they said to him lord ven pilindavaccha goes around addressing the monks as if they were outcastes then the blessed one told a certain monk come monk in my name call pilindavaccha saying the teacher calls you friend vaccha responding as you say lord to the blessed one the monk went to ven pilindavaccha and on arrival said to him the teacher calls you friend vaccha responding as you say my friend to the monk ven pilindavaccha went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him is it true pilindavaccha that you go around addressing the monks as if they were outcastes yes lord then the blessed one having directed attention to ven pilindavaccha s previous lives said to the monks don t take offense at the monk vaccha it s not out of inner hatred that he goes around addressing the monks as if they were outcastes for consecutive lifetimes the monk vaccha has been born in brahman families for a long time he has been accustomed to addressing people as outcastes that s why he goes around addressing the monks as if they were outcastes then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed in whom there s no deceit or conceit his greed ended unpossessive free from longing his anger dispelled his mind unbound he she alternate translation this was said by the lord bhikkhus the skeletons of a single person running on and wandering in samsara for an aeon would make a heap of bones a quantity of bones as large as this mount vepulla if there were someone to collect them and if the collection were not destroyed the bones of a single person accumulated in a single aeon would make a heap like a mountain so said the great sage he declared it to be as great as mount vepulla to the north of vulture s peak in the hill fort of magadha but when one sees with perfect wisdom the four noble truths as they are suffering the origin of suffering the overcoming of suffering and the noble eightfold path leading to relief from suffering having merely run on seven times at the most by destroying all fetters one makes an end of suffering i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at uruvel on the bank of the nera jar river at the root of the bodhi tree the tree of awakening newly awakened and on that occasion he sat at the root of the bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of release then with the passing of seven days after emerging from that concentration in the third watch of the night he gave close attention to dependent co arising in forward and reverse order thus when this is that is in other words from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed as phenomena grow clear to the brahman ardent in jh na he stands routing m ra s army as the sun illumining the sky at savatthi monks i will teach you the burden the carrier of the burden the taking up of the burden and the casting off of the burden as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said and which is the burden the five clinging aggregates it should be said which five form as a clinging aggregate feeling as a clinging aggregate perception as a clinging aggregate fabrications as a clinging aggregate consciousness as a clinging aggregate this monks is called the burden and which is the carrier of the burden the person it should be said this venerable one with such a name such a clan name this is called the carrier of the burden and which is the taking up of the burden the craving that makes for further becoming accompanied by passion delight relishing now here now there i e craving for sensual pleasure craving for becoming craving for non becoming this is called the taking up of the burden and which is the casting off of the burden the remainderless fading cessation renunciation relinquishment release letting go of that very craving this is called the casting off of the burden that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further a burden indeed are the five aggregates and the carrier of the burden is the person taking up the burden in the world is stressful casting off the burden is bliss having cast off the heavy burden and not taking on another pulling up craving along with its root one is free from hunger totally unbound on one occasion the blessed one was staying near conquered by eight untrue dhammas his mind overcome devadatta is headed for a state of deprivation headed for hell there to stay for an eon incurable which eight conquered by material gain his mind overcome devadatta is headed for a state of deprivation headed for hell there to stay for an eon incurable conquered by lack of material gain conquered by status conquered by lack of status conquered by offerings conquered by lack of offerings conquered by evil ambition conquered by evil friendship his mind overcome devadatta is headed for a state of deprivation headed for hell there to stay for an eon incurable monks it s good for a monk to keep conquering again again any arisen material gain it s good for a monk to keep conquering again again any arisen lack of material gain any arisen status any arisen lack of status any arisen offerings any arisen lack of offerings any arisen evil ambition any arisen evil friendship and for what compelling reason should a monk keep conquering again again any arisen material gain any arisen evil friendship because when one dwells not having conquered any arisen material gain effluents arise along with vexations fevers but when one dwells having conquered any arisen material gain those effluents vexations fevers are not similarly with any arisen lack of material gain any arisen status any arisen lack of status any arisen offerings any arisen lack of offerings any arisen evil ambition any arisen evil friendship it s for this compelling reason that a monk should keep conquering again again any arisen material gain any arisen evil friendship therefore monks you should train yourselves we will keep conquering again again any arisen material gain any arisen lack of material gain any arisen status any arisen lack of status any arisen offerings any arisen lack of offerings any arisen evil ambition any arisen evil friendship that s how you should train yourselves it s too cold too hot too late in the evening at why is that from an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration a beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating wandering on long have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things enough to become dispassionate enough to be released at savatthi stay mindful monks and alert this is our instruction to you all and

monk delighting in and approving of the blessed one s words got up from his seat and bowed down to the blessed one circled around him keeping the blessed one to his right and departed then dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent resolute he in no long time reached remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing realizing it for himself in the here now he knew birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for the sake of this world and thus he became another one of the arahants endowed with

right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration he dwells with his persistence aroused thinking gladly would i let the flesh blood in my body dry up leaving just the skin tendons bones but if i have not attained what can be reached through human steadfastness human persistence human striving there will be no relaxing my persistence endowed with these eight qualities a monk is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect an incomparable field of merit for the world there are these four types of people to be found existing in the world which four one in darkness who is headed for darkness one in darkness who is headed for light one in light who is headed for darkness and one in light who is headed for light and how is one the type of person in darkness who is headed for darkness there is the case where a person is born into a lowly family the family of a scavenger a hunter a basket weaver a wheelwright or a sweeper a family that is poor with little food or drink living in hardship where food clothing are hard to come by and he is ugly misshapen stunted sickly half blind or deformed or lame or crippled he doesn t receive any gifts of food drink clothing or vehicles garlands perfumes or ointments bedding shelter or lamps he engages in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct having engaged in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct he on the break up of the body after death reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell this is the type of person in darkness who is headed for darkness and how is one the type of person in darkness who is headed for light there is the case where a person is born into a lower class family the family of a scavenger a hunter a basket weaver a wheelwright or a sweeper a family that is poor with little food or drink living in hardship where food clothing are hard to come by and he is ugly misshapen stunted sickly half blind or deformed or lame or crippled he doesn t receive any gifts of food drink clothing or vehicles garlands perfumes or ointments bedding shelter or lamps he engages in good bodily conduct good verbal conduct good mental conduct having engaged in good bodily conduct good verbal conduct good mental conduct he on the break up of the body after death reappears in the good destination the heavenly world this is the type of person in darkness who is headed for light and how is one the type of person in light who is headed for darkness there is the case where a person is born into an upper class family a noble warrior family a priestly family a prosperous householder family a family that is rich with much wealth with many possessions with a great deal of money a great many accoutrements of wealth a great many commodities and he is well built handsome extremely inspiring endowed with a lotus like complexion he receives gifts of food drink

good mental conduct having engaged in good bodily conduct good verbal conduct good mental conduct he on the break up of the body after death reappears in the good destination the heavenly world this is the type of person in light who is headed for light these are the four types of people to be found existing in the world at then that which is to be attained by seers the place so very hard to reach women can t with their two inch discernment attain then the thought occurred to soma the nun now who has recited this verse a human being or a non human one then it occurred to her this is mara the evil one who has recited this verse wanting to arouse fear horripilation terror in me wanting to make me fall away from concentration then having understood that this is mara the evil one she replied to him in verses what difference does being a woman make when the mind s well centered when knowledge is progressing seeing clearly rightly into the dhamma anyone who thinks i m a woman or a man or am i anything at all that s who mara s fit to address then mara the evil one sad dejected at realizing soma the nun knows me vanished right there in seeing six rewards it s enough motivation for a monk to establish the perception of not self with regard to all phenomena without exception which six i won t be fashioned in connection with any world my i making will be stopped my my making will be stopped i ll be endowed with uncommon knowledge in seeing these six rewards it s enough motivation for a monk to establish the perception of not self with regard to all phenomena without exception then the ear is empty the nose is empty the tongue is empty the body is empty the intellect is empty of a self or of anything pertaining to a self ideas intellect consciousness intellect contact is empty of a self or of anything pertaining to a self thus it is said that the world is empty i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one on a wandering tour among the the brahman householders of icchanangala heard it said gotama the contemplative the son of the sakyans having gone forth from the sakyan clan on a wandering tour among the kosalans with a large community of monks has arrived at icchanangala and is staying in the icchanangala forest grove and of that master gotama this fine reputation has spread he is indeed a blessed one worthy rightly self awakened consummate in knowledge conduct well gone a knower of the cosmos an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed teacher of human divine beings awakened blessed he has made known having realized it through direct knowledge this world with its devas maras brahmas its generations with their contemplatives brahmans their rulers common people has explained the dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end has expounded the holy life both in its particulars in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure it is good to see such a worthy one so the brahman householders of icchanangala when the night was gone taking many staple non staple foods went to the gate house of the icchanangala forest grove on arrival they stood there making a loud racket a great racket lord those are the brahman householders of icchanangala standing at the gate house to the icchanangala forest grove having brought many staple non staple foods for the sake of the blessed one the community of monks may i have nothing to do with honor nagita and honor nothing to do with me whoever cannot obtain at will without difficulty without trouble as i do the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of self awakening let him consent to this slimy excrement pleasure this torpor pleasure this pleasure of gains offerings fame lord let the blessed one acquiesce to their offerings now let the one well gone acquiesce now now is the time for the blessed one s acquiescence lord now is the time for the blessed one s acquiescence lord wherever the blessed one will go now the brahmans of the towns countryside will be so inclined just as when the rain devas send rain in fat drops the waters flow with the incline in the same way wherever the blessed one will go now the brahmans of the towns countryside will be so inclined why is that because such is the blessed one s virtue discernment may i have nothing to do with honor nagita and honor nothing to do with me whoever cannot obtain at will without difficulty without trouble as i do the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of self awakening let him consent to this slimy excrement pleasure this torpor pleasure this pleasure of gains offerings fame nagita there is the case where i see a monk sitting in concentration in a village dwelling the thought occurs to me soon a monastery attendant will disturb this venerable one in some way or a novice will and rouse him from his concentration and so i am not pleased with that monk s village dwelling but then there is the case where i see a monk sitting nodding in the wilderness the thought occurs to me soon this venerable one will dispel his drowsiness fatigue and attend to the wilderness perception then there is the case where i see a wilderness monk sitting unconcentrated in the wilderness the thought occurs to me soon this venerable one will center his unconcentrated mind or protect his concentrated mind and so i am pleased with that monk s wilderness dwelling then there is the case where i see a wilderness monk sitting in concentration in the wilderness the thought occurs to me soon this venerable one will release his unreleased mind or protect his released mind and so i am pleased with that monk s wilderness dwelling then there is the case where i see a village dwelling monk who receives robes alms food shelter medicinal requisites for curing the sick receiving as he likes those gains offerings fame he neglects seclusion he neglects isolated forest wilderness dwellings he makes his living by visiting villages towns cities and so i am not pleased with that monk s village dwelling then there is the case where i see a wilderness monk who receives robes alms food shelter medicinal requisites for curing the sick fending off those gains offerings fame he doesn t neglect seclusion doesn t neglect isolated forest wilderness dwellings and so i am pleased with that monk s wilderness dwelling but when i am traveling along a road and see no one in front or behind me at that time i have my ease even when urinating defecating on one occasion the blessed one was staying near there is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the awakened one indeed the blessed one is worthy and rightly self awakened consummate in knowledge conduct well gone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the teacher of divine human beings awakened blessed he she is endowed with verified confidence in the dhamma the dhamma is well expounded by the blessed one to be seen here now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselves he she is endowed with verified confidence in the sangha the sangha of the blessed one s disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straight forwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully in other words the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types they are the sangha of the blessed one s disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the incomparable field of merit for the world he she is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones untorn unbroken unspotted unsplattered liberating praised by the wise untarnished leading to concentration a disciple of the noble ones endowed with these four qualities is a stream winner steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for self awakening furthermore a disciple of the noble ones endowed with these four qualities is linked with long life human or divine is linked with beauty human or divine is linked with happiness human or divine is linked with status human or divine is linked with influence human or divine i tell you this nandaka not having heard it from any other brahman or contemplative instead i tell you this having known seen and realized it for myself when this was said a certain man said to nandaka the chief minister of the licchavis it is now time for your bath sir nandaka responded enough i say with this external bath i am satisfied with this internal bath confidence in the blessed one i have heard that on one occasion ven yes friends as i understand the teaching explained by the blessed one a monk with no more effluents on the break up of the body is annihilated perishes does not exist after death don t say that friend yamaka don t misrepresent the blessed one it s not good to misrepresent the blessed one for the blessed one would not say a monk with no more effluents on the break up of the body is annihilated perishes does not exist after death but even though ven yamaka was thus rebuked by those monks he from stubbornness attachment maintained his adherence to that evil supposition as i understand the teaching explained by the blessed one a monk with no more effluents on the break up of the body is annihilated perishes does not exist after death when those monks could not pry ven yamaka loose from his evil supposition they got up from their seats and went to ven sariputta on arrival they said to him friend sariputta this evil supposition has arisen to ven yamaka as i understand the teaching explained by the blessed one a monk with no more effluents on the break up of the body is annihilated perishes does not exist after death it would be good if you would go to ven yamaka out of sympathy for his sake ven sariputta consented by remaining silent then in the evening ven sariputta left his seclusion went to ven yamaka and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to ven yamaka is it true my friend yamaka that this evil supposition has arisen to you as i understand the teaching explained by the blessed one a monk with no more effluents on the break up of the body is annihilated perishes does not exist after death yes my friend sariputta as i understand the teaching explained by the blessed one a monk with no more effluents on the break up of the body is annihilated perishes does not exist after death what do you think my friend yamaka is form constant or inconstant inconstant my friend and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful my friend and is it proper to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no my friend is feeling constant or inconstant inconstant my friend is perception constant or inconstant inconstant my friend are fabrications constant or inconstant inconstant my friend is consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant my friend and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful my friend and is it proper to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no my friend thus friend yamaka any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen with right discernment as it has come to be this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am any feeling whatsoever any perception whatsoever any fabrications whatsoever any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen with right discernment as it has come to be this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness disenchanted he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is released with release there is the knowledge released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world how do you construe this my friend yamaka do you regard form as the tathagata no my friend do you regard feeling as the tathagata no my friend do you regard perception as the tathagata no my friend do you regard fabrications as the tathagata no my friend do you regard consciousness as the tathagata no my friend what do you think do you regard the tathagata as being in form elsewhere than form in feeling elsewhere than feeling in perception elsewhere than perception in fabrications elsewhere than fabrications in consciousness elsewhere than consciousness no my friend what do you think do you regard the tathagata as form feeling perception fabrications consciousness no my friend do you regard the tathagata as that which is without form without feeling without perception without fabrications without consciousness no my friend and so my friend yamaka when you can t pin down the tathagata as a truth or reality even in the present life is it proper for you to declare as i understand the teaching explained by the blessed one a monk with no more effluents on the break up of the body is annihilated perishes does not exist after death previously my friend sariputta i did foolishly hold that evil supposition but now having heard your explanation of the dhamma i have abandoned that evil supposition and have broken through to the dhamma then friend yamaka how would you answer if you are thus asked a monk a worthy one with no more mental effluents what is he on the break up of the body after death thus asked i would answer form is inconstant feeling perception fabrications consciousness is inconstant that which is inconstant is stressful that which is stressful has ceased and gone to its end very good my friend yamaka very good in that case i will give you an analogy for the sake of taking your understanding of this point even further so he would go to the householder or householder s son and say may you take me on as a servant lord with that the householder or householder s son would take the man on as a servant having been taken on as a servant the man would rise in the morning before his master go to bed in the evening only after his master doing whatever his master ordered always acting to please him speaking politely to him then the householder or householder s son would come to regard him as a friend companion and would fall into his trust when the man realizes this householder or householder s son trusts me then encountering him in a solitary place he would kill him with a sharp knife now what do you think my friend yamaka when that man went to the householder or householder s son and said may you take me on as a servant lord wasn t he even then a murderer and yet although he was a murderer the householder or householder s son did not know him as my murderer and when taken on as a servant he would rise in the morning before his master go to bed in the evening only after his master doing whatever his master ordered always acting to please him speaking politely to him wasn t he even then a murderer and yet although he was a murderer the householder or householder s son did not know him as my murderer and when he encountered him in a solitary place and killed him with a sharp knife wasn t he even then a murderer and yet although he was a murderer the householder or householder s son did not know him as my murderer yes my friend in the same way an uninstructed run of the mill person who has no regard for noble ones is not well versed or disciplined in their dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not well versed or disciplined in their dhamma assumes form the body to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form he assumes feeling to be the self he assumes perception to be the self he assumes mental fabrications to be the self he assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness he does not discern inconstant form as it actually is present as

discern inconstant consciousness as it actually is present as inconstant consciousness he does not discern stressful form as it actually is present as stressful form he does not discern stressful feeling he does not discern stressful perception he does not discern stressful fabrications he does not discern stressful consciousness as it actually is present as stressful consciousness he does not

discern not self consciousness as it actually is present as not self consciousness he does not discern fabricated form as it actually is present as fabricated form he does not discern fabricated feeling he does not discern fabricated perception he does not discern fabricated fabrications he does not discern fabricated consciousness as it actually is present as fabricated consciousness he does not discern murderous form as it actually is present as murderous form he does not discern murderous feeling he does not discern murderous perception he does not discern murderous fabrications he does not discern murderous consciousness as it actually is present as murderous consciousness he gets attached to form clings to form determines it to be my self he gets attached to feeling he gets attached to perception he gets attached to fabrications he gets attached to consciousness clings to consciousness determines it to be my self now the well instructed disciple of the noble ones who has regard for noble ones is well versed disciplined in their dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is well versed disciplined in their dhamma does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form he does not assume feeling to be the self he does not assume perception to be the self he does not assume fabrications to be the self he does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness he discerns inconstant form as it actually is present as inconstant form he discerns inconstant feeling he discerns inconstant perception he discerns inconstant fabrications he discerns inconstant consciousness as it actually is present as inconstant consciousness he discerns stressful form as it actually is present as stressful form he discerns stressful feeling he discerns stressful perception he discerns stressful fabrications he discerns stressful consciousness as it actually is present as stressful consciousness he discerns not self form as it actually is present as not self form he discerns not self feeling he discerns not self perception he discerns not self fabrications he discerns not self consciousness as it actually is present as not self consciousness he discerns fabricated form as it actually is present as fabricated form he discerns fabricated feeling he discerns fabricated perception he discerns fabricated fabrications he discerns fabricated consciousness as it actually is present as fabricated consciousness he discerns murderous form as it actually is present as murderous form he discerns murderous feeling he discerns murderous perception he discerns murderous fabrications he discerns murderous consciousness as it actually is present as murderous consciousness he does not get attached to form does not cling to form does not determine it to be my self he does not get attached to feeling he does not get attached to perception he does not get attached to fabrications he does not get attached to consciousness does not cling to consciousness does not determine it to be my self these five clinging aggregates not attached to not clung to lead to his long term happiness well being on one occasion the blessed one was traveling along the road between then the blessed one leaving the road went to sit at the root of a certain tree his legs crossed his body erect with mindfulness established to the fore then dona following the blessed one s footprints saw him sitting at the root of the tree confident inspiring confidence his senses calmed his mind calmed having attained the utmost control tranquility tamed guarded his senses restrained a naga no brahman i am not a deva are you a gandhabba no a yakkha no a human being no brahman i am not a human being when asked are you a deva you answer no brahman i am not a deva when asked are you a gandhabba you answer no brahman i am not a gandhabba when asked are you a yakkha you answer no brahman i am not a yakkha when asked are you a human being you answer no brahman i am not a human being then what sort of being are you brahman the fermentations by which if they were not abandoned i would be a deva those are abandoned by me their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising the fermentations by which if they were not abandoned i would be a gandhabba a yakkha a human being those are abandoned by me their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising just like a red blue or white lotus born in the water grown in the water rising up above the water stands unsmeared by the water in the same way i born in the world grown in the world having overcome the world live unsmeared by the world remember me brahman as awakened the fermentations by which i would go to a deva state or become a gandhabba in the sky or go to a yakkha state human state those have been destroyed by me ruined their stems removed like a blue lotus rising up unsmeared by water unsmeared am i by the world and so brahman i m awake monks these four things are born which four affection is born of affection aversion is born of affection affection is born of aversion aversion is born of aversion and how is affection born of affection there is the case where an individual is pleasing appealing charming to another individual others treat that individual as pleasing appealing charming and the other one thinks this individual is pleasing appealing charming to me others treat this individual as pleasing appealing charming he gives rise to affection for them this is how affection is born of affection and how is aversion born of affection there is the case where an individual is pleasing appealing charming to another individual others treat that individual as displeasing unappealing not charming and the other one thinks this individual is pleasing appealing charming to me others treat this individual as displeasing unappealing not charming he gives rise to aversion for them this is

the four things that are born now on the occasion when a monk quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation then any affection of his that is born of affection does not come about any aversion of his that is born of affection any affection of his that is born of aversion any aversion of his that is born of aversion does not come about on the occasion when a monk enters remains in the second jhana enters remains in the third jhana enters remains in the fourth jhana then any affection of his that is born of affection does not come about any aversion of his that is born of affection any affection of his that is born of aversion any aversion of his that is born of aversion does not come about on the occasion when a monk through the ending of the mental fermentations enters remains in the fermentation free awareness release discernment release having known verified them for himself right in the here now then any affection of his that is born of affection is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising any aversion of his that is born of affection any affection of his that is born of aversion any aversion of his that is born of aversion is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising this is said to be a monk who doesn t pull in doesn t push away doesn t smolder doesn t flare up and doesn t burn and how does a monk pull in there is the case where a monk assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form he assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or feeling as in the self or the self as in feeling he assumes perception to be the self or the self as possessing perception or perception as in the self or the self as in perception he assumes mental fabrications to be the self or the self as possessing fabrications or fabrications as in the self or the self as in fabrications he assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness this is how a monk pulls in and how does a monk not pull in there is the case where a monk doesn t assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form he doesn t assume feeling to be the self doesn t assume perception to be the self doesn t assume fabrications to be the self doesn t assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness this is how a monk doesn t pull in and how does a monk push away there is the case where a monk returns insult to one who has insulted him returns anger to one who is angry at him quarrels with one who is quarreling this is how a monk pushes away and how does a monk not push away there is the case where a monk doesn t return insult to one who has insulted him doesn t return anger to one who is angry at him doesn t quarrel with one who is quarreling this is how a monk doesn t push away and how does a monk smolder there is the case where there being i am there comes to be i am here there comes to be i am like this i am otherwise i am bad i am good i might be i might be here i might be like this i might be otherwise may i be may i be here may i be like this may i be otherwise i will be i will be here i will be like this i will be otherwise and how does a monk not smolder there is the case where there not being i am there doesn t come to be i am here there doesn t come to be i am like this i am otherwise i am bad i am good i might be i might be here i might be like this i might be otherwise may i be may i be here may i be like this may i be otherwise i will be i will be here i will be like this i will be otherwise and how does a monk flare up there is the case where there being i am because of this or by means of this there comes to be i am here because of this there comes to be i am like this because of this i am otherwise because of this i am bad because of this i am good because of this i might be because of this i might be here because of this i might be like this because of this i might be otherwise because of this may i be because of this may i be here because of this may i be like this because of this may i be otherwise because of this i will be because of this i will be here because of this i will be like this because of this i will be otherwise because of this and how does a monk not flare up there is the case where there not being i am because of this or by means of this there doesn t come to be i am here because of this there doesn t come to be i am like this because of this i am otherwise because of this i am bad because of this i am good because of this i might be because of this i might be here because of this i might be like this because of this i might be otherwise because of this may i be because of this may i be here because of this may i be like this because of this may i be otherwise because of this i will be because of this i will be here because of this i will be like this because of this i will be otherwise because of this and how does a monk burn there is the case where a monk s conceit of i am is and how does a monk not burn there is the case where a monk s conceit of i am just as the noble buffalo with hairy neck can pull the plough with little effort step by step so do i let the time flow by with little effort day by day when joy untainted has been won on one occasion yes friend the monks responded ven ananda said friends whoever monk or nun declares the attainment of arahantship in my presence they all do it by means of one or another of there is the case where a monk has developed insight preceded by tranquillity as he develops insight preceded by tranquillity the path is born he follows that path develops it pursues it as he follows the path developing it pursuing it his fetters are abandoned his obsessions destroyed then there is the case where a monk has developed tranquillity preceded by insight as he develops tranquillity preceded by insight the path is born he follows that path develops it pursues it as he follows the path developing it pursuing it his fetters are abandoned his obsessions destroyed then there is the case where a monk has developed tranquillity in tandem with insight as he develops tranquillity in tandem with insight the path is born he follows that path develops it pursues it as he follows the path developing it pursuing it his fetters are abandoned his obsessions destroyed then there is the case where a monk s mind has its restlessness concerning the dhamma comm the corruptions of insight well under control there comes a time when his mind grows steady inwardly settles down and becomes unified concentrated in him the path is born he follows that path develops it pursues it as he follows the path developing it pursuing it his fetters are abandoned his obsessions destroyed whoever monk or nun declares the attainment of arahantship in my presence they all do it by means of one or another of these four paths i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at yes lord the monks responded to him the blessed one said monks i will teach you noble right concentration with its supports requisite conditions listen and pay close attention i will speak yes lord the monks responded to him the blessed one said now what monks is noble right concentration with its supports requisite conditions any singleness of mind equipped with these seven factors right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness is called noble right concentration with its supports requisite conditions and what is the right view with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions there is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed there are fruits results of good bad actions there is this world the next world there is mother father there are spontaneously reborn beings there are contemplatives brahmans who faring rightly practicing rightly proclaim this world the next after having directly known realized it for themselves this is the right view with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions and what is the right view that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path the discernment the faculty of discernment the strength of discernment analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening the path factor of right view one makes an effort for the abandoning of wrong view for entering into right view this is one s right effort one is mindful to abandon wrong view to enter remain in right view this is one s right mindfulness and what is right resolve right resolve i tell you is of two sorts there is right resolve with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions there is right resolve that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path and what is the right resolve with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions resolve for renunciation resolve for freedom from ill will resolve for harmlessness this is the right resolve with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions and what is the right resolve that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path the thinking directed thinking resolve mental fixity mental transfixion focused awareness verbal fabrications in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble whose mind is without effluents who is fully possessed of the noble path this is the right resolve that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path one makes an effort for the abandoning of wrong resolve for entering right resolve this is one s right effort one is mindful to abandon wrong resolve to enter remain in right resolve this is one s right mindfulness thus these three qualities right view right effort right mindfulness run circle around right resolve and what is right speech right speech i tell you is of two sorts there is right speech with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions there is right speech that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path and what is the right speech with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions abstaining from lying from divisive tale bearing from abusive speech from idle chatter this is the right speech with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions and what is the right speech that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path the abstaining desisting abstinence avoidance of the four forms of verbal misconduct in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble whose mind is without effluents who is fully possessed of the noble path this is the right speech that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path one makes an effort for the abandoning of wrong speech for entering right speech this is one s right effort one is mindful to abandon wrong speech to enter remain in right speech this is one s right mindfulness thus these three qualities right view right effort right mindfulness run circle around right speech and what is right action right action i tell you is of two sorts there is right action with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions there is right action that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path and what is the right action with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions abstaining from killing from taking what is not given from illicit sex and what is the right action that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path the abstaining desisting abstinence avoidance of the three forms of bodily misconduct in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble whose mind is without effluents who is fully possessed of the noble path this is the right action that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path one makes an effort for the abandoning of wrong action for entering into right action this is one s right effort one is mindful to abandon wrong action to enter remain in right action this is one s right mindfulness thus these three qualities right view right effort right mindfulness run circle around right action and what is right livelihood right livelihood i tell you is of two sorts there is right livelihood with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions there is right livelihood that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path and what is the right livelihood with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions there is the case where a disciple of the noble ones abandons wrong livelihood and maintains his life with right livelihood this is the right livelihood with effluents siding with merit resulting in acquisitions and what is the right livelihood that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path the abstaining desisting abstinence avoidance of wrong livelihood in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble whose mind is without effluents who is fully possessed of the noble path this is the right livelihood that is noble without effluents transcendent a factor of the path one tries to abandon wrong livelihood to enter into right livelihood this is one s right effort one is mindful to abandon wrong livelihood to enter remain in right livelihood this is one s right mindfulness thus these three qualities right view right effort right mindfulness run circle around right livelihood of those right view is the forerunner and how is right view the forerunner in one of right view right resolve comes into being in one of right resolve right speech comes into being in one of right speech right action in one of right action right livelihood in one of right livelihood right effort in one of right effort right mindfulness in one of right mindfulness right concentration in one of right concentration right knowledge in one of right knowledge right release comes into being of those right view is the forerunner and how is right view the forerunner in one of right view wrong view is abolished the many evil unskillful qualities that come into play with wrong view as their condition are also abolished while the many skillful qualities that have right view as their condition go to the culmination of their development in one of right resolve wrong resolve is abolished in one of right speech wrong speech is abolished in one of right action wrong action is abolished in one of right livelihood wrong livelihood is abolished in one of right effort wrong effort is abolished in one of right mindfulness wrong mindfulness is abolished in one of right concentration wrong concentration is abolished in one of right knowledge wrong knowledge is abolished in one of right release wrong release is abolished the many evil unskillful qualities that come into play with wrong release as their condition are also abolished while the many skillful qualities that have right release as their condition go to the culmination of their development thus monks there are twenty factors siding with skillfulness and twenty with unskillfulness this dhamma discourse on the great forty has been set rolling and cannot be stopped by any contemplative or brahman or deva or mara and brahma or anyone at all in the world if any contemplative or brahman might think that this great forty dhamma discourse should be censured rejected there are ten legitimate implications of his statement that would form grounds for censuring him here now if he censures right view then he would honor any contemplatives brahmans who are of wrong view he would praise them if he censures right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration right knowledge if he censures right release then he would honor any contemplatives brahmans who are of wrong release he would praise them if any contemplative or brahman might think that this great forty dhamma discourse should be censured rejected there are these ten legitimate implications of his statement that would form grounds for censuring him here now even that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words luminous monks is the mind luminous monks is the mind and it is freed from incoming defilements luminous monks is the mind and it is defiled by incoming defilements the uninstructed run of the mill person doesn t discern that as it actually is present which is why i tell you that for the uninstructed run of the mill person there is no development of the mind luminous monks is the mind and it is freed from incoming defilements the well instructed disciple of the noble ones discerns that as it actually is present which is why i tell you that for the well instructed disciple of the noble ones there is development of the mind dwelling at and what is dependent co arising from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications from fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name form from name form as a requisite condition come the six sense media from the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact from contact as a requisite condition comes feeling from feeling as a requisite condition comes craving from craving as a requisite condition comes clinging sustenance from clinging sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth from birth as a requisite condition then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair come into play such is the origination of this entire mass of stress suffering and what is and what is and what is and what is and what is and what are and what is and what is and what are and what is now from the remainderless fading cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications from the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness from the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name form from the cessation of name form comes the cessation of the six sense media from the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact from the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling from the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving from the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging sustenance from the cessation of clinging sustenance comes the cessation of becoming from the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth from the cessation of birth then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair all cease such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress suffering outside the walls they stand at crossroads at door posts they stand returning to their old homes but when a meal with plentiful food drink is served no one remembers them such is the kamma of living beings thus those who feel sympathy for their dead relatives give timely donations of proper food drink exquisite clean thinking may this be for our relatives may our relatives be happy and those who have gathered there the assembled shades of the relatives with appreciation give their blessing for the plentiful food drink may our relatives live long because of whom we have gained this gift we have been honored and the donors are not without reward for there in their realm there s no farming no herding of cattle no commerce no trading with money they live on what is given here hungry shades whose time here is done as water raining on a hill flows down to the valley even so does what is given here benefit the dead as rivers full of water fill the ocean full even so does what is given here benefit the dead he gave to me she acted on my behalf they were my relatives companions friends offerings should be given for the dead when one reflects thus on things done in the past for no weeping no sorrowing no other lamentation benefits the dead whose relatives persist in that way but when this offering is given well placed in the sangha it works for their long term benefit and they profit immediately in this way the proper duty to relatives has been shown great honor has been done to the dead and monks have been given strength the merit you ve acquired isn t small on one occasion the blessed one was staying at yes lord in the same way monks if you don t veer toward the near shore don t veer toward the far shore don t sink in the middle don t get washed up on high ground don t get snared by human beings don t get snared by non human beings don t get snared in a whirlpool and don t become rotten inside you will tend to unbinding tilt to unbinding incline to unbinding why is that because right view tends to unbinding tilts to unbinding inclines to unbinding when this was said a certain monk addressed the blessed one what lord is the near shore what is the far shore what is sinking in the middle what is being washed up on high ground what is being snared by human beings what is being snared by non human beings what is being snared by a whirlpool what is becoming rotten inside the near shore monks stands for the six internal sense media the far shore stands for the six external sense media sinking in the middle stands for passion delight being washed up on high ground stands for the conceit i am and what monks is being snared by human beings there is the case where a monk lives entangled with householders delighting with them and sorrowing with them happy when they are happy pained when they are in pain taking on their affairs as his own duty this is called being snared by human beings and what monks is being snared by non human beings there is the case where a certain monk lives the holy life in hopes of a certain company of devas thinking by means of this virtue or practice or austerity or holy life i will become one sort of deva or another this is called being snared by non human beings being snared by a whirlpool stands for the five strings of sensuality and what monks is becoming rotten inside there is the case where a certain monk is unprincipled evil unclean and suspect in his undertakings hidden in his actions not a contemplative though claiming to be one not leading the holy life though claiming to do so inwardly rotten oozing with desire filthy by nature this is called becoming rotten inside in that case nanda lead the cows back to their owners the cows will go back lord out of attachment for their calves lead the cows back to their owners nanda then having led the cows back to their owners nanda the cowherd went to the blessed one and on arrival told him the cows lord have been led back to their owners let me obtain the going forth in the blessed one s presence let me obtain the full acceptance there are o monks four nutriments for the sustenance of beings born and for the support of beings seeking birth what are the four edible food coarse and fine secondly sense impression thirdly volitional thought fourthly consciousness after these words the venerable moliya phagguna addressed the exalted one as follows who o lord consumes the question is not correct said the exalted one i do not say that he consumes who o lord has a sense impression the question is not correct said the exalted one i do not say that he has a sense impression had i said so then the question who has a sense impression would be appropriate but since i did not speak thus the correct way to ask the question will be what is the condition of sense impression and to that the correct reply is the sixfold sense base is a condition of sense impression and sense impression is the condition of feeling who o lord feels the question is not correct said the exalted one i do not say that he feels had i said so then the question who feels would be appropriate but since i did not speak thus the correct way to ask the question will be what is the condition of feeling and to that the correct reply is sense impression is the condition of feeling and feeling is the condition of craving who o lord craves the question is not correct said the exalted one i do not say that he craves had i said so then the question who craves would be appropriate but since i did not speak thus the correct way to ask the question will be what is the condition of craving and to that the correct reply is feeling is the condition of craving and craving is the condition of clinging who o lord clings the question is not correct said the exalted one i do not say that he clings had i said so then the question who clings would be appropriate but since i did not speak thus the correct way to ask the question will be what is the condition of clinging and to that the correct reply is craving is the condition of clinging and clinging is the condition of the process of becoming such is the origin of this entire mass of suffering through the complete fading away and cessation of even these six bases of sense impression sense impression ceases monks these three are fabricated characteristics of what is fabricated which three arising is discernible passing away is discernible alteration literally other ness while staying is discernible these are three fabricated characteristics of what is fabricated now these three are unfabricated characteristics of what is unfabricated which three no arising is discernible no passing away is discernible no alteration while staying is discernible these are three unfabricated characteristics of what is unfabricated at savatthi there ven sariputta addressed the monks friends yes friend the monks responded ven sariputta said friends just now as i was withdrawn in seclusion this train of thought arose to my awareness is there anything in the world with whose change or alteration there would arise within me sorrow lamentation pain distress despair then the thought occurred to me there is nothing in the world with whose change or alteration there would arise within me sorrow lamentation pain distress despair when this was said ven ananda said to ven sariputta sariputta my friend even if there were change alteration in the teacher would there arise within you no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair even if there were change alteration in the teacher my friend there would arise within me no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair still i would have this thought what a great being of great might of great prowess has disappeared for if the blessed one were to remain for a long time that would be for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit happiness of human divine beings surely said ven ananda it s because ven sariputta s i making mine making and obsessions with conceit have long been well uprooted that even if there were change alteration in the teacher there would arise within him no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at when this was said one of the ministers said to the king your majesty there is when this was said the king remained silent then another minister said to the king your majesty there is when this was said the king remained silent all this time jivaka komarabhacca was sitting silently not far from the king so the king said to him friend jivaka why are you silent your majesty there is the blessed one worthy and rightly self awakened staying in my mango grove with a large community of monks monks in all concerning this blessed one this admirable report has been spread surely the blessed one is worthy and rightly self awakened consummate in clear knowing and conduct well gone an expert with regard to the cosmos unexcelled trainer of tamable people teacher of beings human and divine awakened blessed your majesty should visit him perhaps if you visited him he would enlighten and bring peace to your mind then in that case friend jivaka have the riding elephants prepared having replied as you say your majesty having had five hundred female elephants prepared as well as the king s personal tusker jivaka announced to the king your majesty your riding elephants are prepared do what you think it is now time to do then the king having had five hundred of his women mounted on the five hundred female elephants one on each and having mounted his own personal tusker set out from the capital in full royal state with attendants carrying torches headed for jivaka komarabhacca s mango grove but when the king was not far from the mango grove he was gripped with fear trepidation his hair standing on end fearful agitated his hair standing on end he said to jivaka komarabhacca friend jivaka you aren t deceiving me are you you aren t betraying me are you you aren t turning me over to my enemies are you how can there be such a large community of monks in all with no sound of sneezing no sound of coughing no voices at all don t be afraid great king don t be afraid i m not deceiving you or betraying you or turning you over to your enemies go forward great king go forward those are lamps burning in the pavilion hall then the king going as far on his tusker as the ground would permit dismounted and approached the door of the pavilion on foot on arrival he asked jivaka where friend jivaka is the blessed one that is the blessed one great king sitting against the middle pillar facing east surrounded by the community of monks then the king approached the blessed one and on reaching him stood to one side as he was standing there surveying the community of monks sitting in absolute silence as calm as a lake he felt inspired to exclaim may my son the blessed one said have you come great king together with your affections lord my son prince udayibhadda is very dear to me may he enjoy the same peace that this community of monks now enjoys then bowing down to the blessed one and saluting the community of monks with his hands palm to palm over his heart he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one i would like to ask the blessed one about a certain issue if he would give me the opportunity to explain my question ask great king whatever you like the king s question lord there are these common craftsmen elephant trainers horse trainers charioteers archers standard bearers camp marshals supply corps officers high royal officers commandos military heroes armor clad warriors leather clad warriors domestic slaves confectioners barbers bath attendants cooks garland makers laundrymen weavers basket makers potters calculators accountants and any other common craftsmen of a similar sort they live off the fruits of their crafts visible in the here and now they give pleasure and refreshment to themselves to their parents wives and children to their friends and colleagues they put in place an excellent presentation of offerings to brahmans and contemplatives leading to heaven resulting in happiness conducive to a heavenly rebirth is it possible lord to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life visible in the here and now do you remember great king ever having asked this question of other brahmans and contemplatives yes i do if it isn t troublesome for you how did they answer no it s not troublesome for me wherever the blessed one or someone like the blessed one is sitting then speak great king non action once lord i approached when this was said purana kassapa said to me great king in acting or getting others to act in mutilating or getting others to mutilate in torturing or getting others to torture in inflicting sorrow or in getting others to inflict sorrow in tormenting or getting others to torment in intimidating or getting others to intimidate in taking life taking what is not given breaking into houses plundering wealth committing burglary ambushing highways committing adultery speaking falsehood one does no evil if with a razor edged disk one were to turn all the living beings on this earth to a single heap of flesh a single pile of flesh there would be no evil from that cause no coming of evil even if one were to go along the right bank of the ganges killing and getting others to kill mutilating and getting others to mutilate torturing and getting others to torture there would be no evil from that cause no coming of evil even if one were to go along the left bank of the ganges giving and getting others to give making sacrifices and getting others to make sacrifices there would be no merit from that cause no coming of merit through generosity self control restraint and truthful speech there is no merit from that cause no coming of merit thus when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now purana kassapa answered with non action just as if a person when asked about a mango were to answer with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit were to answer with a mango in the same way when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now purana kassapa answered with non action the thought occurred to me how can anyone like me think of disparaging a brahman or contemplative living in his realm yet i neither delighted in purana kassapa s words nor did i protest against them neither delighting nor protesting i was dissatisfied without expressing dissatisfaction without accepting his teaching without adopting it i got up from my seat and left purification through wandering on another time i approached when this was said makkhali gosala said to me great king there is no cause no requisite condition for the defilement of beings beings are defiled without cause without requisite condition there is no cause no requisite condition for the purification of beings beings are purified without cause without requisite condition there is nothing self caused nothing other caused nothing human caused there is no strength no effort no human energy no human endeavor all living beings all life all beings all souls are powerless devoid of strength devoid of effort subject to the changes of fate serendipity and nature they are sensitive to pleasure and pain in the six great classes of birth there are principle modes of origin there are kinds of kamma five kinds and three kinds full kamma and half kamma there are pathways sub eons six great classes of birth eight classes of men modes of livelihood kinds of wanderers naga abodes faculties hells dust realms seven spheres of percipient beings seven spheres of non percipient beings seven kinds of jointed plants seven kinds of devas seven kinds of human beings seven kinds of demons seven great lakes seven major knots seven minor knots major precipices minor precipices major dreams minor dreams great aeons having transmigrated and wandered on through these the wise and the foolish alike will put an end to pain though one might think through this morality this practice this austerity or this holy life i will ripen unripened kamma and eliminate ripened kamma whenever touched by it that is impossible pleasure and pain are measured out the wandering on is fixed in its limits there is no shortening or lengthening no accelerating or decelerating thus when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now makkhali gosala answered with purification through wandering on just as if a person when asked about a mango were to answer with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit were to answer with a mango in the same way when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now makkhali gosala answered with purification through wandering on the thought occurred to me how can anyone like me think of disparaging a brahman or contemplative living in his realm yet i neither delighted in makkhali gosala s words nor did i protest against them neither delighting nor protesting i was dissatisfied without expressing dissatisfaction without accepting his teaching without adopting it i got up from my seat and left annihilation another time i approached when this was said ajita kesakambalin said to me great king there is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed there is no fruit or result of good or bad actions there is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no brahmans or contemplatives who faring rightly and practicing rightly proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselves a person is a composite of four primary elements at death the earth in the body returns to and merges with the external earth substance the fire returns to and merges with the external fire substance the liquid returns to and merges with the external liquid substance the wind returns to and merges with the external wind substance the sense faculties scatter into space four men with the bier as the fifth carry the corpse its eulogies are sounded only as far as the charnel ground the bones turn pigeon colored the offerings end in ashes generosity is taught by idiots the words of those who speak of existence after death are false empty chatter with the break up of the body the wise and the foolish alike are annihilated destroyed they do not exist after death thus when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now ajita kesakambalin answered with annihilation just as if a person when asked about a mango were to answer with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit were to answer with a mango in the same way when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now ajita kesakambalin answered with annihilation the thought occurred to me how can anyone like me think of disparaging a brahman or contemplative living in his realm yet i neither delighted in ajita kesakambalin s words nor did i protest against them neither delighting nor protesting i was dissatisfied without expressing dissatisfaction without accepting his teaching without adopting it i got up from my seat and left non relatedness another time i approached when this was said pakudha kaccayana said to me great king there are these seven substances unmade irreducible uncreated without a creator barren stable as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar that do not alter do not change do not interfere with one another are incapable of causing one another pleasure pain or both pleasure and pain which seven the earth substance the liquid substance the fire substance the wind substance pleasure pain and the soul as the seventh these are the seven substances unmade irreducible uncreated without a creator barren stable as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar that do not alter do not change do not interfere with one another and are incapable of causing one another pleasure pain or both pleasure and pain and among them there is no killer nor one who causes killing no hearer nor one who causes hearing no cognizer nor one who causes cognition when one cuts off another person s head there is no one taking anyone s life it is simply between the seven substances that the sword passes thus when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now pakudha kaccayana answered with non relatedness just as if a person when asked about a mango were to answer with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit were to answer with a mango in the same way when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now pakudha kaccayana answered with non relatedness the thought occurred to me how can anyone like me think of disparaging a brahman or contemplative living in his realm yet i neither delighted in pakudha kaccayana s words nor did i protest against them neither delighting nor protesting i was dissatisfied without expressing dissatisfaction without accepting his teaching without adopting it i got up from my seat and left fourfold restraint another time i approached when this was said nigantha nataputta said to me great king there is the case where the nigantha the knotless one is restrained with the fourfold restraint and how is the nigantha restrained with the fourfold restraint there is the case where the nigantha is obstructed by all waters conjoined with all waters cleansed with all waters suffused with all waters this is how the nigantha is restrained with the fourfold restraint when the nigantha a knotless one is restrained with such a fourfold restraint he is said to be a knotless one nigantha a son of thus when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now nigantha nataputta answered with fourfold restraint just as if a person when asked about a mango were to answer with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit were to answer with a mango in the same way when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now nigantha nataputta answered with fourfold restraint the thought occurred to me how can anyone like me think of disparaging a brahman or contemplative living in his realm yet i neither delighted in nigantha nataputta s words nor did i protest against them neither delighting nor protesting i was dissatisfied without expressing dissatisfaction without accepting his teaching without adopting it i got up from my seat and left evasion another time i approached when this was said sa jaya belatthaputta said to me if you ask me if there exists another world after death if i thought that there exists another world would i declare that to you i don t think so i don t think in that way i don t think otherwise i don t think not i don t think not not if you asked me if there isn t another world both is and isn t neither is nor isn t if there are beings who transmigrate if there aren t both are and aren t neither are nor aren t if the tathagata exists after death doesn t both neither exists nor doesn t exist after death would i declare that to you i don t think so i don t think in that way i don t think otherwise i don t think not i don t think not not thus when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now sa jaya belatthaputta answered with evasion just as if a person when asked about a mango were to answer with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit were to answer with a mango in the same way when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now sa jaya belatthaputta answered with evasion the thought occurred to me this among these brahmans and contemplatives is the most foolish and confused of all how can he when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now answer with evasion still the thought occurred to me how can anyone like me think of disparaging a brahman or contemplative living in his realm yet i neither delighted in sa jaya belatthaputta s words nor did i protest against them neither delighting nor protesting i was dissatisfied without expressing dissatisfaction without accepting his teaching without adopting it i got up from my seat and left the first visible fruit of the contemplative life so lord i ask the blessed one as well there are these common craftsmen elephant trainers horse trainers charioteers archers standard bearers camp marshals supply corps officers high royal officers commandos military heroes armor clad warriors leather clad warriors domestic slaves confectioners barbers bath attendants cooks garland makers laundrymen weavers basket makers potters calculators accountants and any other common

and colleagues they put in place an excellent presentation of offerings to brahmans and contemplatives leading to heaven resulting in happiness conducive to a heavenly rebirth is it possible lord to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life visible in the here and now yes it is great king but first with regard to that i will ask you a counter question answer however you please suppose there were a man of yours your slave your workman rising in the morning before you going to bed in the evening only after you doing whatever you order always acting to please you speaking politely to

being and i too am a human being yet king ajatasattu enjoys himself supplied and replete with the five strings of sensuality like a deva as it were while i am his slave his workman always watching for the look on his face i too should do meritorious deeds what if i were to shave off my hair and beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness so after some time he shaves off his hair and beard puts on the ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessness having thus gone forth he lives restrained in body speech and mind content with the simplest food and shelter delighting in solitude then suppose one of your men were to inform you you should know your majesty that that man of yours your slave your workman always watching for the look on your face has gone forth from the household life into homelessness content with the simplest food and shelter delighting in solitude would you thus informed say bring that man back to me make

neither exists nor does not exist after death now lady when asked if the tathagata exists after death you say that has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata exists after death when asked if the tathagata does not exist after death both exists and does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death you say that too has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death now what is the cause what is the reason why that has not been declared by the blessed one very well then great king i will question you in return about this very same matter answer as you see fit what do you think great king do you have an accountant or actuary or mathematician who can count the grains of sand in the river ganges as so many grains of sand or so many hundreds of grains of sand or so many thousands of grains of sand or so many hundreds of thousands of grains of sand no lady then do you have an accountant or calculator or mathematician who can count the water in the great ocean as so many buckets of water or so many hundreds of buckets of water or so many thousands of buckets of water or so many hundreds of thousands of buckets of water no lady why is that the great ocean is deep boundless hard to fathom even so great king any physical form by which one describing the tathagata would describe him any feeling any perception any mental fabrication any consciousness by which one describing the tathagata would describe him that the tathagata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising freed from the classification of consciousness great king the tathagata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the ocean the tathagata exists after death doesn t apply the tathagata doesn t exist after death doesn t apply the tathagata both exists and doesn t exist after death doesn t apply the tathagata neither exists nor doesn t exist after death doesn t apply then king pasenadi kosala delighting in approving of the bhikkhuni khema s words got up from his seat bowed down to her and keeping her to his right departed then at another time he went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to the blessed one sat to one side as he was sitting there he asked the blessed one the same questions he had asked the bhikkhuni khema and received precisely the same responses and analogies then he exclaimed amazing lord astounding how the meaning and phrasing of the teacher and disciple agree coincide and do not diverge from one another with regard to the supreme teaching recently lord i went to the bhikkhuni khema and on arrival asked her about this matter and she answered me with the same words the same phrasing as the blessed one amazing lord astounding how the meaning and phrasing of the teacher and disciple agree coincide and do not diverge from one another with regard to the supreme teaching now lord we must go many are our duties many our responsibilities then do great king what you think it is now time to do so king pasenadi kosala delighting in and approving of the blessed one s words got up from his seat bowed down to the blessed one and keeping him to his right departed now at that time uncertainty arose in the monks with regard to this and that item now what is allowed by the blessed one what is not allowed they told this matter to the blessed one who said bhikkhus whatever i have not objected to saying this is not allowable if it fits in with what is not allowable if it goes against what is allowable this is not allowable for you whatever i have not objected to saying this is not allowable if it fits in with what is allowable if it goes against what is not allowable this is allowable for you and whatever i have not permitted saying this is allowable if it fits in with what is not allowable if it goes against what is allowable this is not allowable for you and whatever i have not permitted saying this is allowable if it fits in with what is allowable if it goes against what is not allowable this is allowable for you at it s in the same way an uninstructed run of the mill person regards form as this is mine this is my self this is what i am he regards feeling perception fabrications consciousness as this is mine this is my self this is what i am if he walks he walks right around these five clinging aggregates if he stands he stands right next to these five clinging aggregates if he sits he sits right next to these five clinging aggregates if he lies down he lies down right next to these five clinging aggregates thus one should reflect on one s mind with every moment for a long time has this mind been defiled by passion aversion delusion from the defilement of the mind are beings defiled from the purification of the mind are beings purified monks have you ever seen a moving contraption yes lord that moving contraption was created by the mind and this mind is even more variegated than a moving contraption thus one should reflect on one s mind with every moment for a long time has this mind been defiled by passion aversion delusion from the defilement of the mind are beings defiled from the purification of the mind are beings purified monks i can imagine no one group of beings more variegated than that of common animals common animals are created by mind and the mind is even more variegated than common animals thus one should reflect on one s mind with every moment for a long time has this mind been defiled by passion aversion delusion from the defilement of the mind are beings defiled from the purification of the mind are beings purified it s now what do you think monks is form constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord is feeling constant or inconstant inconstant lord is perception constant or inconstant inconstant lord are fabrications constant or inconstant inconstant lord what do you think monks is consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord thus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am any feeling whatsoever any perception whatsoever any fabrications whatsoever any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am seeing thus the well instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness disenchanted he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is fully released with full release there is the knowledge fully released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world monks there are these five types of warriors who can be found existing in the world which five there is the case of a warrior who taking his sword shield strapping on his bow quiver goes down into the thick of battle there in the battle he strives makes effort but while he is striving making an effort his opponents strike him down and finish him off some warriors are like this this is the first type of warrior who can be found existing in the world then there is the warrior who taking his sword shield strapping on his bow quiver goes down into the thick of battle there in the battle he strives makes effort but while he is striving making an effort his opponents wound him he gets carried out and taken to his relatives but while he is being taken to his relatives before he has reached them he dies along the way some warriors are like this this is the second type of warrior who can be found existing in the world then there is the warrior who taking his sword shield strapping on his bow quiver goes down into the thick of battle there in the battle he strives makes effort but while he is striving making an effort his opponents wound him he gets carried out and taken to his relatives who nurse him and care for him but he dies of that injury some warriors are like this this is the third type of warrior who can be found existing in the world then there is the warrior who taking his sword shield strapping on his bow quiver goes down into the thick of battle there in the battle he strives makes effort but while he is striving making an effort his opponents wound him he gets carried out and taken to his relatives his relatives nurse him and care for him and he recovers from his injury some warriors are like this this is the fourth type of warrior who can be found existing in the world then there is the warrior who taking his sword shield strapping on his bow quiver goes down into the thick of battle on winning the battle victorious in battle he comes out at the very head of the battle some warriors are like this this is the fifth type of warrior who can be found existing in the world these are the five types of warriors who can be found existing in the world in the same way monks there are these five warrior like individuals who can be found existing among the monks which five there is the case of the monk who dwells in dependence on a certain village or town early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his bowl outer robe he goes into the village or town for alms with his body speech mind unprotected with mindfulness unestablished with his sense faculties unguarded there he sees a woman improperly dressed or half naked as he sees her improperly dressed or half naked lust ravages his mind with his mind ravaged by lust he without renouncing the training without declaring his weakness engages in sexual intercourse this individual i tell you is like the warrior who taking his sword shield strapping on his bow quiver goes down into the thick of battle there in the battle he strives makes effort but while he is striving making an effort his opponents strike him down and finish him off some individuals are like this this is the first type of warrior like individual who can be found existing among the monks then there is the case of the monk who dwells in dependence on a certain village or town early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his bowl outer robe he goes into the village or town for alms with his body speech mind unprotected with mindfulness unestablished with his sense faculties unguarded there he sees a woman improperly dressed or half naked as he sees her improperly dressed or half naked lust ravages his mind with his mind ravaged by lust he burns in body mind the thought occurs to him what if i were to go to the monastery and tell the monks friends i am assailed by lust overcome by lust i can t continue in the holy life declaring my weakness in the training renouncing the training i will return to the lower life he heads toward the monastery but before he arrives there along the way he declares his weakness in the training renounces the training and returns to the lower life this individual i tell you is like the warrior who taking his sword shield strapping on his bow quiver goes down into the thick of battle there in the battle he strives makes effort but while he is striving making an effort his opponents wound him he gets carried out and taken to his relatives but while he is being taken to his relatives before he has reached them he dies along the way some individuals are like this this is the second type of warrior like individual who can be found existing among the monks then there is the case of the monk who dwells in dependence on a certain village or town early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his bowl outer robe he goes into the village or town for alms with his body speech mind unprotected with mindfulness unestablished with his sense faculties unguarded there he sees a woman improperly dressed or half naked as he sees her improperly dressed or half naked lust ravages his mind with his mind ravaged by lust he burns in body mind the thought occurs to him what if i were to go to the monastery and tell the monks friends i am assailed by lust overcome by lust i can t continue in the holy life declaring my weakness in the training renouncing the training i will return to the lower life going to the monastery he tells the monks friends i am assailed by lust overcome by lust i can t continue in the holy life declaring my weakness in the training renouncing the training i will return to the lower life then his companions in the holy life admonish instruct him friend the blessed one has said that sensual pleasures are of little satisfaction of much stress much despair greater drawbacks the blessed one has compared sensual pleasures to a thus admonished instructed by his companions in the holy life he says even though the blessed one has said that sensual pleasures are of little satisfaction of much stress much despair greater drawbacks still i can t continue in the holy life declaring my weakness in the training renouncing the training i will return to the lower life so he declares his weakness in the training renounces the training and returns to the lower life this individual i tell you is like the warrior who taking his sword shield strapping on his bow quiver goes down into the thick of battle there in the battle he strives makes effort but while he is striving making an effort his opponents wound him he gets carried out and taken to his relatives who nurse him and care for him but he dies of that injury some individuals are like this this is the third type of warrior like individual who can be found existing among the monks then there is the case of the monk who dwells in dependence on a certain village or town early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his bowl outer robe he goes into the village or town for alms with his body speech mind unprotected with mindfulness unestablished with his sense faculties unguarded there he sees a woman improperly dressed or half naked as he sees her improperly dressed or

admonish instruct him friend the blessed one has said that sensual pleasures are of little satisfaction of much stress much despair greater drawbacks the blessed one has compared sensual pleasures to a chain of bones of much stress much despair greater drawbacks he has compared sensual pleasures to a lump of flesh a grass torch a pit of glowing embers a dream borrowed goods the fruits of a tree a slaughterhouse spears swords a poisonous snake of much stress much despair greater drawbacks find delight friend in the holy life don t declare your weakness in the training renounce the training or return to the lower life thus admonished instructed by his companions in the holy life he responds i will strive friends i will remember i will find delight in the holy life i won t yet declare my weakness in the training renounce the training or return to the lower life this individual i tell you is like the warrior who taking his sword shield strapping on his bow quiver goes down into the thick of battle there in the battle he strives makes effort but while he is striving making an effort his opponents wound him he gets carried out and taken to his relatives who nurse him and care for him and he recovers from his injury some individuals are like this this is the fourth type of warrior like individual who can be found existing among the monks then there is the case of the monk who dwells in dependence on a certain village or town early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his bowl outer robe he goes into the village or town for alms with his body speech mind protected with mindfulness established with his sense faculties guarded on seeing a form with the eye does not grasp at any theme or particulars by which if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him he practices with restraint he guards the faculty of the eye he achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the eye on hearing a sound with the ear on smelling an aroma with the nose on tasting a flavor with the tongue on touching a tactile sensation with the body on cognizing an idea with the intellect he does not grasp at any theme or particulars by which if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him he practices with restraint he guards the faculty of the intellect he achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the intellect abandoning covetousness with regard to the world he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness he cleanses his mind of covetousness abandoning ill will anger he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will sympathetic with the welfare of all living beings he cleanses his mind of ill will anger abandoning sloth drowsiness he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth drowsiness mindful alert percipient of light he cleanses his mind of sloth drowsiness abandoning restlessness anxiety he dwells undisturbed his mind inwardly stilled he cleanses his mind of restlessness anxiety abandoning uncertainty he dwells having crossed over uncertainty with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities he cleanses his mind of uncertainty having abandoned these five hindrances corruptions of awareness that weaken discernment then quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress he enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain with his mind thus concentrated purified bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations he discerns as it has come to be that this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the way leading to the cessation of stress these are mental fermentations this is the origination of fermentations this is the cessation of fermentations this is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations his heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignorance with release there is the knowledge released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world this individual i tell you is like the warrior who taking his sword shield strapping on his bow quiver goes down into the thick of battle on winning the battle victorious in battle he comes out at the very head of the battle some individuals are like this this is the fifth type of warrior like individual who can be found existing among the monks these are the five warrior like individuals who can be found existing among the monks monks there are these there are these then a certain monk went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one it would be good if the blessed one would teach me the dhamma in brief so that having heard the dhamma from the blessed one i might dwell alone in seclusion heedful ardent resolute but it is in just this way that some worthless men make a request but then having been told the dhamma think they should tag along right behind me may the blessed one teach me the dhamma in brief may the one well gone teach me the dhamma in brief it may well be that i will understand the blessed one s words it may well be that i will become an heir to the blessed one s words then monk you should train yourself thus my mind will be established inwardly well composed no evil unskillful qualities once they have arisen will remain consuming the mind that s how you should train yourself then you should train yourself thus good will as my awareness release will be developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated well undertaken that s how you should train yourself when you have developed this concentration in this way you should develop this concentration with directed thought evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought a modicum of evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought no evaluation you should develop it accompanied by rapture not accompanied by rapture endowed with a sense of enjoyment you should develop it endowed with equanimity when this concentration is thus developed thus well developed by you you should then train yourself thus compassion as my awareness release appreciation as my awareness release equanimity as my awareness release will be developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated well undertaken that s how you should train yourself when you have developed this concentration in this way you should develop this concentration with directed thought evaluation you

will go in comfort wherever you stand you will stand in comfort wherever you sit you will sit in comfort wherever you lie down you will lie down in comfort then that monk having been admonished by an admonishment from the blessed one got up from his seat and bowed down to the blessed one circled around him keeping the blessed one to his right side and left then dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent resolute he in no long time reached remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing realizing it for himself in the here now he knew birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for the sake of this world and thus he became another one of the arahants at a when this was said the brahman jata bharadvaja said to the blessed one tangle the buddha on one occasion a large number of senior monks were living near the senior monks acquiesced by silence then citta the householder sensing the senior monks acquiescence got up from his seat and having bowed down to them circumambulated them keeping them to his right and left when the night had passed the senior monks put on their robes in the early morning and taking their bowls outer robes went to citta s residence there they sat down on the appointed seats then citta the householder with his own hand served satisfied them with exquisite milk rice mixed with ghee when the senior monks had finished eating and had rinsed their bowls hands they got up from their seats and left citta the householder having said give away the rest followed behind the senior monks now on that occasion it was hot sweltering the senior monks went along with their bodies melting as it were from the meal they had finished and on that occasion yes friend mahaka that would be nice then ven mahaka willed a psychic feat such that a cool wind blew a thundering cloud developed and the rain fell in scattered drops the thought occurred to citta the householder such is the psychic power of the most junior of all the monks in this community then when ven mahaka reached the monastery park he said to the senior monk is that enough venerable sir that s enough friend mahaka what you have done what you have offered then the monks went to their separate dwellings and ven mahaka went to his then citta the householder went to ven mahaka and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to him it would be good venerable sir if master mahaka would show me a superior human attainment a miracle of psychic power in that case householder spread out your upper robe on the porch and put a pile of grass on it responding as you say venerable sir citta the householder spread out his upper robe on the porch and put a pile of grass on it then ven mahaka having entered his dwelling and bolted the door willed a psychic feat such that flame shot through the keyhole and the space around the door burning up the grass but not the robe then citta the householder having shaken out the robe stood to one side in awe his hair standing on end ven mahaka came out of his dwelling and said is that enough householder that s enough venerable sir what you have done what you have offered may master mahaka delight in the charming wild mango grove at macchikasanda i will be responsible for your robes almsfood lodgings medicinal requisites that is admirably said householder then ven mahaka having set his lodging in order and taking his bowl robes left macchikasanda and in leaving macchikasanda he was gone for good and never returned at savatthi then early in the morning sisupacala the nun put on her robes and taking her bowl outer robe went into savatthi for alms when she had gone for alms in savatthi and had returned from her alms round after her meal she went to the grove of the blind to spend the day having gone deep into the grove of the blind she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day s abiding then mara the evil one wanting to arouse fear horripilation terror in her wanting to make her fall from solitude approached her said whose philosophy do you approve of nun i don t approve of anyone s philosophy my friend then mara the evil one sad dejected at realizing sisupacala the nun knows me vanished right there mara sister sisupacala this is what should be done by one who is skilled in goodness and who knows the path of peace let them be able and upright straightforward and gentle in speech humble and not conceited contented and easily satisfied unburdened with duties and frugal in their ways peaceful and calm and wise and skillful not proud or demanding in nature let them not do the slightest thing that the wise would later reprove wishing in gladness and in safety may all beings be at ease whatever living beings there may be whether they are weak or strong omitting none the great or the mighty medium short or small the seen and the unseen those living near and far away those born and to be born may all beings be at ease let none deceive another or despise any being in any state let none through anger or ill will wish harm upon another even as a mother protects with her life her child her only child so with a boundless heart should one cherish all living beings radiating kindness over the entire world spreading upwards to the skies and downwards to the depths outwards and unbounded freed from hatred and ill will whether standing or walking seated or lying down free from drowsiness one should sustain this recollection this is said to be the sublime abiding by not holding to fixed views the pure hearted one having clarity of vision being freed from all sense desires is not born again into this world in the sky o monks various kinds of winds are blowing winds from the east west north and south winds carrying dust and winds without dust winds hot and cold gentle and fierce similarly monks there arise in this body various kinds of feelings pleasant feelings arise painful feelings arise and neutral feelings arise just as in the sky above winds of various kinds are blowing coming from the east or west blowing from the north or south some carry dust and others not cold are some and others hot some are fierce and others mild their blowing is so different so also in this body here feelings of different kind arise the pleasant feelings and the painful and the neutral ones but if a monk is ardent and does not neglect to practice mindfulness and comprehension clear the nature of all feelings will he understand and having penetrated them he will be taint free in this very life mature in knowledge firm in dhamma s ways when once his life span ends his body breaks all measure and concept he has transcended at as we understand the dhamma taught to us by the blessed one this is the greater the tears we have shed while transmigrating wandering this long long time crying weeping from being joined with what is displeasing being separated from what is pleasing not the water in the four great oceans excellent monks excellent it is excellent that you thus understand the dhamma taught by me this is the greater the tears you have shed while transmigrating wandering this long long time crying weeping from being joined with what is displeasing being separated from what is pleasing not the water in the four great oceans long have you repeatedly experienced the death of a mother the tears you have shed over the death of a mother while transmigrating wandering this long long time crying weeping from being joined with what is displeasing being separated from what is pleasing are greater than the water in the four great oceans long have you repeatedly experienced the death of a father the death of a brother the death of a sister the death of a son the death of a daughter loss with regard to relatives loss with regard to wealth loss with regard to disease the tears you have shed over loss with regard to disease while transmigrating wandering this long long time crying weeping from being joined with what is displeasing being separated from what is pleasing are greater than the water in the four great oceans why is that from an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration a beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating wandering on long have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things enough to become dispassionate enough to be released see also the greed with which beings go to a bad destination an untaught worldling o monks experiences pleasant feelings he experiences painful feelings and he experiences neutral feelings a well taught noble disciple likewise experiences pleasant painful and neutral feelings now what is the distinction the diversity the difference that exists herein between a well taught noble disciple and an untaught worldling when an untaught worldling is touched by a painful bodily feeling he worries and grieves he laments beats his breast weeps and is distraught he thus experiences two kinds of feelings a bodily and a mental feeling it is as if a man were pierced by a dart and following the first piercing he is hit by a second dart so that person will experience feelings caused by two darts it is similar with an untaught worldling when touched by a painful bodily feeling he worries and grieves he laments beats his breast weeps and is distraught so he experiences two kinds of feeling a bodily and a mental feeling having been touched by that painful feeling he resists and resents it then in him who so resists and resents that painful feeling an underlying tendency of resistance against that painful feeling comes to underlie his mind under the impact of that painful feeling he then proceeds to enjoy sensual happiness and why does he do so an untaught worldling o monks does not know of any other escape from painful feelings except the enjoyment of sensual happiness then in him who enjoys sensual happiness an underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feelings comes to underlie his mind he does not know according to facts the arising and ending of these feelings nor the gratification the danger and the escape connected with these feelings in him who lacks that knowledge an underlying tendency to ignorance as to neutral feelings comes to underlie his mind when he experiences a pleasant feeling a painful feeling or a neutral feeling he feels it as one fettered by it such a one o monks is called an untaught worldling who is fettered by birth by old age by death by sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair he is fettered by suffering this i declare but in the case of a well taught noble disciple o monks when he is touched by a painful feeling he will not worry nor grieve and lament he will not beat his breast and weep nor will he be distraught it is having been touched by that painful feeling he does not resist and resent it hence in him no underlying tendency of resistance against that painful feeling comes to underlie his mind under the impact of that painful feeling he does not proceed to enjoy sensual happiness and why not as a well taught noble disciple he knows of an escape from painful feelings other than by enjoying sensual happiness then in him who does not proceed to enjoy sensual happiness no underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feelings comes to underlie his mind he knows according to facts the arising and ending of those feelings and the gratification the danger and the escape connected with these feelings in him who knows thus no underlying tendency to ignorance as to neutral feelings comes to underlie his mind when he experiences a pleasant feeling a painful feeling or a neutral feeling he feels it as one who is not fettered by it such a one o monks is called a well taught noble disciple who is not fettered by birth by old age by death by sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair he is not fettered to suffering this i declare this o monks is the distinction the diversity the difference that exists between a well taught noble disciple and an untaught worldling indeed headman the tathaagata does dwell in compassion for all living beings well then lord does not the blessed one teach dhamma in full i will reply to this question headman with another answer as seems proper to you what do you think suppose a peasant farmer has three fields one excellent one middling and one poor sandy salty with bad soil tell me when the farmer wants to sow his seed which field would he sow first the excellent one the middling one or the poor one that is sandy salty and with bad soil lord the farmer who wanted to sow his seed would sow the excellent field first having done that he would sow the middling field next and the one that was poor sandy salty with bad soil he might or might not sow why well it might do for cattle food well headman that excellent field is like my monks and nuns to them i teach the dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in spirit and in letter the middling field is like my male and female lay followers to these too i teach the dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in spirit and in letter i display to them the holy life perfectly fulfilled and purified why because these people adhere to me as their island their shelter their resort their refuge the poor field that is sandy salty and with bad soil is like my wandering recluses and brahmans of other sects i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near then early in the morning aggivessana what a bad thing to hear we have heard master assaji when we have heard that gotama the contemplative teaches this sort of thing perhaps sooner or later we might go to meet with gotama the contemplative perhaps there might be some discussion perhaps we might pry him away from that evil viewpoint now on that occasion five hundred then some of the licchavis said who is gotama the contemplative that he will refute the statement of saccaka the niga ha son it s saccaka the niga ha son who will refute the statement of gotama the contemplative some of the licchavis said who is saccaka the niga ha son that he will refute the statement of gotama the contemplative it s gotama the contemplative who will refute the statement of saccaka the niga ha son so saccaka the niga ha son surrounded by five hundred licchavis went to the gabled hall in the great forest now on that occasion a large number of monks were doing walking meditation in the open air so saccaka the niga ha son went up to the monks and said where masters is master gotama now we want to see master gotama the blessed one aggivessana having plunged into the great forest is sitting under a certain tree for the day s abiding then saccaka the niga ha son together with a large group of licchavis plunged into the great forest and went to the blessed one on arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with the blessed one after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side some of the licchavis having bowed down to the blessed one sat to one side some of the licchavis exchanged courteous greetings with the blessed one and after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies sat to one side some of the licchavis having raised their hands palm to palm in front of the chest sat to one side some of the licchavis after announcing their name and clan sat to one side some of the licchavis staying silent sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one i would like to question master gotama on a certain point if master gotama would grant me the favor of an answer to the question ask aggivessana as you see fit how does master gotama discipline his disciples or what part of his instruction is generally presented to his disciples aggivessana i discipline my disciples in this way this part of my instruction is generally presented to my disciples form is inconstant feeling is inconstant perception is inconstant fabrications are inconstant consciousness is inconstant form is not self feeling is not self perception is not self fabrications are not self consciousness is not self all fabrications are inconstant all phenomena are not self this aggivessana is the way in which i discipline my disciples this part of my instruction is generally presented to my disciples a simile occurs to me master gotama let it occur to you aggivessana just as any seeds that exhibit growth increase proliferation all do so in dependence on the earth or just as any activities requiring strength that are done all are done in dependence on the earth in the same way master gotama an individual with form as self taking a stance on form produces merit or demerit an individual with feeling as self with perception as self with fabrications as self with consciousness as self taking a stance on consciousness produces merit or demerit then aggivessana are you saying form is my self feeling is my self perception is my self fabrications are my self consciousness is my self yes master gotama i m saying that form is my self feeling is my self perception is my self fabrications are my self consciousness is my self as does this great multitude what does this great multitude have to do with you please focus just on your own assertion yes master gotama i m saying that form is my self feeling is my self perception is my self fabrications are my self consciousness is my self very well then aggivessana i will cross question you on this matter answer as you see fit what do you think would a consecrated noble warrior king such as yes master gotama he would wield the power in his own domain to execute those who deserve execution to fine those who deserve to be fined and to banish those who deserve to be banished even these oligarchic groups such as the vajjians mallans wield the power in their own domains to execute those who deserve execution to fine those who deserve to be fined and to banish those who deserve to be banished what do you think aggivessana when you say form is my self do you wield power over that form may my form be thus may my form not be thus when this was said saccaka the niga ha son was silent a second time the blessed one said to saccaka the niga ha son what do you think aggivessana when you say form is my self do you wield power over that form may my form be thus may my form not be thus when this was said saccaka the niga ha son was silent a second time then the blessed one said to him answer now aggivessana this is not the time to be silent when anyone doesn t answer when asked a legitimate question by the tath gata up to three times his head splits into seven pieces right here now on that occasion the spirit the blessed one saw the spirit vajirap in as did saccaka the niga ha son so saccaka afraid terrified his hair standing on end seeking shelter in the blessed one seeking a cave asylum in the blessed one seeking refuge in the blessed one said to the blessed one let master gotama ask me i will answer what do you think aggivessana when you say form is my self do you wield power over that form may my form be thus may my form not be thus no master gotama pay attention aggivessana and answer only after having paid attention what you said after isn t consistent with what you said before nor is what you said before consistent with what you said after what do you think aggivessana when you say feeling is my self perception is my self fabrications are my self consciousness is my self do you wield power over that consciousness may my consciousness be thus may my consciousness not be thus no master gotama pay attention aggivessana and answer only after having paid attention what you said after isn t consistent with what you said before nor is what you said before consistent with what you said after what do you think aggivessana is form constant or inconstant inconstant master gotama and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful master gotama and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no master gotama is feeling constant or inconstant inconstant master gotama is perception constant or inconstant inconstant master gotama are fabrications constant or inconstant inconstant master gotama what do you think aggivessana is consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant master gotama and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful master gotama and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no master gotama what do you think aggivessana when one adheres to stress holds to stress is attached to stress and envisions of stress that this is mine this is my self this is what i am would he comprehend stress or dwell having totally destroyed stress how could that be master gotama no master gotama that being the case aggivessana don t you adhere to stress hold to stress aren t you attached to stress and don t you envision of stress that this is mine this is my self this is what i am how could that not be the case master gotama yes master gotama suppose a man in need of heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood were to enter a forest taking a sharp ax there he would see a large plantain trunk straight young immature he would cut it at the root and having cut it at the root cut off the crown having cut off the crown he would unfurl the leaf sheaths unfurling the leaf sheaths he wouldn t even find sapwood there to say nothing of heartwood in the same way aggivessana when you are interrogated rebuked pressed by me with regard to your own statement you are empty void mistaken but it was you who made this statement before the assembly in ves l i see no contemplative or brahman the head of an order the head of a group or even one who claims to be an arahant rightly self awakened who engaged in debate with me would not shiver quiver shake break out in sweat under the armpits even if i were to engage a senseless stump in debate it engaged with me in debate would shiver quiver shake to say nothing of a human being but now some drops of sweat coming out of your forehead drenching your upper robe are landing on the ground whereas now i have no sweat on my body and the blessed one uncovered his golden colored body to the assembly when this was said saccaka the niga ha son fell silent abashed sitting with his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for words then let it occur to you dummukha the blessed one said suppose lord that not far from a village or town was a pond there in it was a crab then a number of boys girls leaving the village or town would go to the pond and on arrival would go down to bathe in it taking the crab out of the water they would place it on the ground and whenever the crab extended a leg the boys or girls would cut it off break it and smash it with sticks or stones right there so that the crab with all its legs cut off broken smashed would be unable to get back in the water as before in the same way whatever saccaka the niga ha son s writhings capers contortions the blessed one has cut them off broken them and smashed them all so that saccaka the niga ha son is now unable to approach the blessed one again for the purpose of debate when this was said saccaka the niga ha son said to dummukha the licchavi son just you wait dummukha just you wait dummukha you re a big mouth dummukha now master gotama to what extent is a disciple of master gotama one who carries out his message carries out his instruction one who has crossed over beyond doubt one with no more questioning one who has gained fearlessness and dwells independent of others with regard to the teacher s message there is the case aggivessana where a disciple of mine sees with right discernment any form whatsoever past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form as it has come to be as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am he sees with right discernment any feeling any perception any fabrications any consciousness whatsoever past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness as it has come to be as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am it s to this extent aggivessana that a disciple of mine is one who carries out my message carries out my instruction one who has crossed over beyond doubt one with no more questioning one who has gained fearlessness and dwells independent of others with regard to the teacher s message and to what extent master gotama is a monk an arahant one whose mental effluents are ended who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal laid to waste the fetter of becoming and is released through right gnosis there is the case aggivessana where a monk having seen with right discernment any form whatsoever past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form as it has come to be as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am is through lack of clinging sustenance released having seen with right discernment any feeling any perception any fabrications any consciousness whatsoever past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness as it has come to be as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am he is through lack of clinging sustenance released it s to this extent aggivessana that a monk is an arahant one whose mental effluents are ended who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal laid to waste the fetter of becoming and is released through right gnosis one thus released is endowed with three unsurpassables unsurpassable vision unsurpassable practice unsurpassable release and a monk whose mind is thus released still honors respects reveres worships the tath gata in this way awakened the blessed one teaches the dhamma for awakening tamed the blessed one teaches the dhamma for taming tranquil the blessed one teaches the dhamma for tranquility having crossed over the blessed one teaches the dhamma for crossing over totally unbound the blessed one teaches the dhamma for total unbinding when this was said saccaka the niga ha son said to the blessed one it is we master gotama who were insolent we who were reckless in that we construed that master gotama could be attacked statement by statement for there might be safety for a person who has attacked a rutting elephant but there is no safety for a person who has attacked master gotama there might be safety for a person who has attacked a mass of fire but there is no safety for a person who has attacked master gotama there might be safety for a person who has attacked a fanged snake a poisonous snake but there is no safety for a person who has attacked master gotama it is we master gotama who were insolent we who were reckless in that we construed that master gotama could be attacked statement by statement may master gotama together with the community of monks acquiesce to my offer of tomorrow s meal the blessed one acquiesced with silence then saccaka the niga ha son sensing the blessed one s acquiescence addressed the licchavis listen master licchavis gotama the contemplative is invited for tomorrow together with the community of monks offer to me what you construe to be proper for him then after the night had passed the licchavis offered to saccaka the niga ha son a food offering of approximately five hundred oblation dishes saccaka the niga ha son after having exquisite staple non staple food prepared in his own monastery announced the time to the blessed one it s time master gotama the meal is ready so the blessed one early in the morning adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl robes went together with the community of monks to saccaka the niga ha son s monastery on arrival he sat down on a seat laid out saccaka the niga ha son with his own hand served satisfied the community of monks headed by the blessed one with exquisite staple non staple food then when the blessed one had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl saccaka the niga ha son taking a lower seat sat down to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one master gotama may the merit and accoutrements of the merit of this gift be exclusively for the happiness of the donors aggivessana whatever has come from giving to a recipient such as you not without passion not without aversion not without delusion that will be for the donors whatever has come from giving to a recipient such as me without passion without aversion without delusion that will be for you for more on the buddha s approach to argument and debate see there are these gross impurities in gold dirty sand gravel grit the dirt washer or his apprentice having placed the gold in a vat washes it again again until he has washed them away when he is rid of them there remain the moderate impurities in the gold coarse sand fine grit he washes the gold again again until he has washed them away when he is rid of them there remain the fine impurities in the gold fine sand black dust the dirt washer or his apprentice washes the gold again again until he has washed them away when he is rid of them there remains just the gold dust the goldsmith or his apprentice having placed it in a crucible blows on it again again to blow away the dross the gold as long as it has not been blown on again again to the point where the impurities are blown away as long as it is not refined free from dross is not pliant malleable or luminous it is brittle and not ready to be worked but there comes a time when the goldsmith or his apprentice has blown on the gold again again until the dross is blown away the gold having been blown on again again to the point where the impurities are blown away is then refined free from dross pliant malleable luminous it is not brittle and is ready to be worked then whatever sort of ornament he has in mind whether a belt an earring a necklace or a gold chain the gold would serve his purpose in the same way there are these gross impurities in a monk intent on heightened mind misconduct in body speech mind these the monk aware able by nature abandons dispels wipes out of existence when he is rid of them there remain in him the moderate impurities thoughts of sensuality ill will harmfulness these he abandons dispels wipes out of existence when he is rid of them there remain in him the fine impurities thoughts of his caste thoughts of his home district thoughts related to not wanting to be despised these he abandons dispels wipes out of existence when he is rid of them there remain only thoughts of the dhamma his concentration is neither calm nor refined it has not yet attained serenity or unity and is kept in place by the fabrication of forceful restraint but there comes a time when his mind grows steady inwardly settles down grows unified concentrated his concentration is calm refined has attained serenity unity and is no longer kept in place by the fabrication of forceful restraint and then whichever of the higher knowledges he turns his mind to know realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants he wields manifold supranormal powers having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one he appears he vanishes he goes unimpeded through walls ramparts and mountains as if through space he dives in and out of the earth as if it were water he walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land sitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged bird with his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon so mighty and powerful he exercises influence with his body even as far as the brahma worlds he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants he hears by means of the divine ear element purified and surpassing the human both kinds of sounds divine and human whether near or far he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants he knows the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with his own awareness he discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passion he discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion he discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion he discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind and a scattered mind as a scattered mind he discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mind he discerns an excelled mind one that is not at the most excellent level as an excelled mind and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind he discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind he discerns a released mind as a released mind and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants he recollects his manifold past lives lit previous homes i e one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion recollecting there i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose there there too i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose here thus he remembers his manifold past lives in their modes and details he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants he sees by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human beings passing away and re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma these beings who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell but these beings who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world thus by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human he sees beings passing away and re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants then through the ending of the mental effluents he remains in the effluent free awareness release and discernment release having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here and now he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening on that occasion when this was said citta the householder said to the garden devas forest devas tree devas and devas inhabiting herbs grasses forest giants even that is inconstant even that is impermanent one must abandon even that when one passes on when this was said citta the householder s friends companions relatives and kinsmen said to him steady your mindfulness master don t ramble what did i say that you say to me steady your mindfulness master don t ramble you said even that is inconstant even that is impermanent one must abandon even that when one passes on that was because garden devas forest devas tree devas and devas inhabiting herbs grasses forest giants have assembled and said to me make a wish householder in the future may i become a king a wheel turning monarch and i said to them even that is inconstant even that is impermanent one must abandon even that when one passes on but what compelling reason do those garden devas forest devas tree devas and devas inhabiting herbs grasses forest giants see master that they say to you make a wish householder in the future may i become a king a wheel turning monarch it occurs to them this citta the householder is virtuous of admirable character if he should wish in the future may i become a king a wheel turning monarch then as he is virtuous this wish of his would succeed because of the purity of his virtue a righteous one he will wield righteous power then master instruct us too then you should train yourselves we will be endowed with verified confidence in the buddha indeed the blessed one the buddha is worthy rightly self awakened consummate in knowledge conduct well gone an expert with regard to the cosmos unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the teacher of divine human beings awakened blessed we will be endowed with verified confidence in the dhamma the dhamma is well expounded by the blessed one to be seen here now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselves we will be possessed of verified confidence in the sangha the sangha of the blessed one s disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straight forwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully in other words the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types they are the sangha of the blessed one s disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the incomparable field of merit for the world whatever there may be in our family that can be given away all that will be shared unstintingly with virtuous ones who are of admirable character that s how you should train yourselves for those without feet i have love i have love for all with two feet for those with four feet i have love i have love for all with many feet may those without feet do me no harm may none with two feet do me harm may those with four feet do me no harm may none with many feet do me harm may all beings all living things all who ve come to be one and all may they see every blessing may no evil at all come to them without limit is buddha without limit is dhamma without limit is sangha thus have i heard at one time the exalted one was living at saavatthi in the jeta grove anaathapi n dika s monastery there he addressed the monks thus monks revered one the monks answered the exalted one in assent the exalted one spoke thus monks i shall preach to you the summary and the exposition of the ideal lover of solitude listen and give attention i shall speak even so revered sir the monks answered the exalted one in assent the exalted one said this let one not trace back the past or yearn for the future yet to come that which is past is left behind unattained is the yet to come but that which is present he discerns with insight as and when it comes the immovable the non irritable in that state should the wise one grow today itself should one bestir tomorrow death may come who knows for no bargain can we strike with death who has his mighty hosts but one who dwells thus ardently by day by night untiringly him the tranquil sage has called the ideal lover of solitude and how monks does one trace back the past he thinks i was of such form in the past and brings delight to bear on it he thinks i was of such feeling in the past and brings delight to bear on it he thinks i was of such perception in the past and brings delight to bear on it he thinks i was of such formations in the past and brings delight to bear on them he thinks i was of such consciousness in the past and brings delight to bear on it that is how monks one traces back the past and how monks does one not trace back the past he thinks i was of such form in the past but brings no delight to bear on it he thinks i was of such feeling of such perception of such formations he thinks i was of such consciousness in the past but brings no delight to bear on it that is how monks one does not trace back the past and how monks does one yearn for the future he thinks i may have such form in the future and brings delight to bear on it he thinks i may have such feeling such perception such formations he thinks i may have such consciousness in the future and brings delight to bear on it that is how monks one yearns for the future and how monks does one not yearn for the future he thinks i may have such form in the future but brings no delight to bear on it he thinks i may have such feeling such perception such formations he thinks i may have such consciousness in the future but brings no delight to bear on it that is how monks one does not yearn for the future and how is one drawn into present things herein monks an uninstructed ordinary man who takes no account of the noble ones is unskilled in the dhamma of the noble ones untrained in the dhamma of the noble ones taking no account of the good men unskilled in the dhamma of the good men untrained in the dhamma of the good men looks upon form as self or self as possessed of form or form as in self or self as in form he looks upon feeling as self or self as possessed of feeling or feeling as in self or self as in feeling he looks upon perception as self or self as possessed of perception or perception as in self or self as in perception he looks upon formations as self or self as possessed of formations or formations as in self or self as in formations he looks upon consciousness as self or self as possessed of consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousness that is how monks one is drawn into present things and how monks is one not drawn into present things herein monks an instructed noble disciple who takes into account the noble ones skilled in the dhamma of the noble ones trained in the dhamma of the noble ones taking into account the good men skilled in the dhamma of the good men trained in the dhamma of the good men does not look upon form as self or self as possessed of form or form as in self or self as in form he does not look upon feeling as self he does not look upon perception as self he does not look upon formations as self he does not look upon consciousness as self or self as possessed of consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousness that is how monks one is not drawn into present things let one not trace back the past or yearn for the future yet to come that which is past is left behind unattained is the yet to come but that which is present he discerns with insight as and when it comes the immovable the non irritable in that state should the wise one grow today itself should one bestir tomorrow death may come who knows for no bargain can we strike with death who has his mighty hosts but one who dwells thus ardently by day by night untiringly him the tranquil sage has called the ideal lover of solitude so it was with reference to this that it was said monks i shall preach to you the summary and the exposition of the ideal lover of solitude thus spoke the exalted one delighted those monks rejoiced in what the exalted one had said i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near gay at gay head and on that occasion many ascetics on the cold winter nights of the between the eights the blessed one saw those many ascetics on the cold winter nights of the between the eights when the snow was falling in gay jumping up in the water jumping down in the water doing a jumping up down in the water pouring water over themselves and performing the fire sacrifice thinking through this there is purity then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed not by water is one clean though many people are bathing here whoever has truth rectitude heshe when the thundering storm cloud roars out in the mist and torrents of rain fill the paths of the birds nestled in a mountain cave the monk meditates no greater contentment than this can be found when along the rivers the tumbling flowers bloom in winding wreaths adorned with verdant color seated on the bank glad minded he meditates no greater contentment than this can be found when in the depths of night in a lonely forest the rain deva drizzles and the fanged beasts cry nestled in a mountain cave the monk meditates no greater contentment than this can be found when restraining himself and his discursive thoughts dwelling in a hollow in the mountains midst devoid of fear and barrenness he meditates no greater contentment than this can be found when he is happy expunged of stain waste and grief unobstructed unencumbered unassailed having ended all defilements he meditates no greater contentment than this can be found then friends i thought the signless concentration of the heart the signless concentration of the heart they say now what is that then i thought in this a monk paying no attention to any distinguishing signs then friends paying no attention to any distinguishing signs i entered on and dwelt in that concentration of the heart which is without signs but as i dwelt thus and then friends the blessed one came to me by his powers and after that friends paying no attention to any distinguishing signs i entered on and dwelt in the signless concentration of the heart now friends if anyone were to truly declare through the teacher s compassion the disciple gained great super knowledge these four traditions of the noble ones original long standing traditional ancient unadulterated unadulterated from the beginning are not open to suspicion will never be open to suspicion and are unfaulted by knowledgeable contemplatives and brahmans which four there is the case where a monk is content with any old robe cloth at all he speaks in praise of being content with any old robe cloth at all he does not for the sake of robe cloth do anything unseemly or inappropriate not getting cloth he is not agitated getting cloth he uses it not tied to it uninfatuated guiltless seeing the drawbacks of attachment to it and discerning the escape from them he does not on account of his contentment with any old robe cloth at all exalt himself or disparage others in this he is skillful energetic alert and mindful this monks is said to be a monk standing firm in the ancient original traditions of the noble ones furthermore the monk is content with any old almsfood at all he speaks in praise of being content with any old almsfood at all he does not for the sake of almsfood do anything unseemly or inappropriate not getting almsfood he is not agitated getting almsfood he uses it not tied to it uninfatuated guiltless seeing the drawbacks of attachment to it and discerning the escape from them he does not on account of his contentment with any old almsfood at all exalt himself or disparage others in this he is skillful energetic alert and mindful this monks is said to be a monk standing firm in the ancient original traditions of the noble ones furthermore the monk is content with any old lodging at all he speaks in praise of being content with any old lodging at all he does not for the sake of lodging do anything unseemly or inappropriate not getting lodging he is not agitated getting lodging he uses it not tied to it uninfatuated guiltless seeing the drawbacks of attachment to it and discerning the escape from them he does not on account of his contentment with any old lodging at all exalt himself or disparage others in this he is skillful energetic alert and mindful this monks is said to be a monk standing firm in the ancient original traditions of the noble ones furthermore the monk finds pleasure and delight in developing skillful mental qualities finds pleasure and delight in abandoning unskillful mental qualities he does not on account of his pleasure and delight in developing and abandoning exalt himself or disparage others in this he is skillful energetic alert and mindful this monks is said to be a monk standing firm in the ancient original traditions of the noble ones these are the four traditions of the noble ones original long standing traditional ancient unadulterated unadulterated from the beginning which are not open to suspicion will never be open to suspicion and are unfaulted by knowledgeable contemplatives and brahmans and furthermore a monk endowed with these four traditions of the noble ones if he lives in the east conquers displeasure and is not conquered by displeasure if he lives in the west the north the south he conquers displeasure and is not conquered by displeasure why is that because the wise one endures both pleasure and displeasure this is what the blessed one said having said this he said further displeasure does not conquer the enlightened one displeasure does not suppress him he conquers displeasure because he endures it having cast away all deeds who could obstruct him like an ornament of finest goldbrahmai have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at saying all right my friend the blessed one went out come in contemplative saying all right my friend the blessed one went in a second time a third time the alavaka yakkha said to the blessed one get out contemplative saying all right my friend the blessed one went out come in contemplative saying all right my friend the blessed one went in then a fourth time the alavaka yakkha said to the blessed one get out contemplative i won t go out my friend do what you have to do my friend i see no one in the cosmos with its devas maras brahmas its contemplatives brahmans its royalty commonfolk who could possess my mind or rip open my heart or grabbing me by the feet hurl me across the ganges but nevertheless ask me what you wish alavaka the buddha alavaka the buddha alavaka the buddha alavaka i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near then the blessed one early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe bowl went into savatthi for alms having wandered for alms in savatthi and returning from his alms round after his meal he set his lodging in order carrying his robes bowl he went along the road to where angulimala was staying cowherds shepherds farmers saw him going along the road to where angulimala was staying and on seeing him said to him don t go along that road contemplative for on that road is angulimala brutal bloody handed devoted to killing slaying showing no mercy to living beings he has turned villages into non villages towns into non towns settled countryside into unsettled countryside having repeatedly killed human beings he wears a garland made of fingers groups of ten twenty thirty forty men have gone along that road and even they have fallen into angulimala s hands when this was said the blessed one kept going in silence a second time a third time cowherds shepherds farmers said to the blessed one don t go along that road contemplative groups of ten twenty thirty forty men have gone along that road and even they have fallen into angulimala s hands when this was said the blessed one kept going in silence then angulimala saw the blessed one coming from afar and on seeing him this thought occurred to him isn t it amazing isn t it astounding groups of ten twenty thirty forty men have gone along this road and even they have fallen into my hands and yet now this contemplative comes attacking as it were alone and without a companion why don t i kill him so angulimala taking up his sword shield buckling on his bow quiver followed right behind the blessed one then the blessed one willed a feat of psychic power such that angulimala though running with all his might could not catch up with the blessed one walking at normal pace then the thought occurred to angulimala isn t it amazing isn t it astounding in the past i ve chased seized even a swift running elephant a swift running horse a swift running chariot a swift running deer but now even though i m running with all my might i can t catch up with this contemplative walking at normal pace so he stopped and called out to the blessed one stop contemplative stop i then the thought occurred to angulimala these sakyan contemplatives are speakers of the truth asserters of the truths and yet this contemplative even while walking says i have stopped angulimala so angulimala the bandit addressed this verse to the blessed one while walking contemplative you say i have stopped but when then the blessed one set out wandering toward savatthi with ven angulimala as his attendant monk after wandering by stages he reached savatthi and there he lived near savatthi in jeta s grove anathapindika s monastery then king pasenadi kosala with a cavalry of roughly horsemen drove out of savatthi and entered the monastery driving as far as the ground was passable for chariots he got down from his chariot and went on foot to the blessed one on arrival having bowed down he sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him what is it great king has no lord king seniya bimbisara of magadha hasn t provoked me nor have the licchavis of vesali nor has some other hostile king there is a bandit in my realm lord named angulimala brutal bloody handed devoted to killing slaying showing no mercy to living beings he has turned villages into non villages towns into non towns settled countryside into unsettled countryside having repeatedly killed human beings he wears a garland made of fingers i am going to stamp him out great king suppose you were to see angulimala with his hair beard shaved off wearing the ochre robe having gone forth from the home life into homelessness refraining from killing living beings refraining from taking what is not given refraining from telling lies living the holy life on one meal a day virtuous of fine character what would you do to him we would bow down to him lord or rise up to greet him or offer him a seat or offer him robes almsfood lodgings or medicinal requisites for curing illness or we would arrange a lawful guard protection defense but how could there be such virtue restraint in an unvirtuous evil character now at that time ven angulimala was sitting not far from the blessed one so the blessed one pointing with his right arm said to king pasenadi kosala that great king is angulimala then king pasenadi kosala was frightened terrified his hair standing on end so the blessed one sensing the king s fear hair raising awe said to him don t be afraid great king don t be afraid he poses no danger to you then the king s fear his terror his hair standing on end subsided he went over to ven angulimala and said are you really angulimala lord yes great king what is your father s clan what is your mother s clan my father is a then may master gagga mantaniputta delight in staying here i will be responsible for your robes almsfood lodgings medicinal requisites for curing illness now it so happened that at that time ven angulimala was a wilderness dweller an alms goer wearing one set of the triple robe made of cast off cloth so he said to king pasenadi kosala enough great king my triple robe is complete so king pasenadi kosala went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one it s amazing lord it s astounding how the blessed one has tamed the untamed pacified the unpeaceful and brought to unbinding those who were not unbound for what we could not tame even with blunt or bladed weapons the blessed one has tamed without blunt or bladed weapons now lord we must go many are our duties many our responsibilities then do great king what you think it is now time to do then king pasenadi kosala got up from his seat bowed down to the blessed one and keeping him to his right departed then ven angulimala early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe bowl went into savatthi for alms as he was going from house to house for alms he saw a woman suffering a breech birth on seeing her the thought occurred to him how tormented are living beings how tormented are living beings then having wandered for alms in savatthi and returning from his alms round after his meal he went to the blessed one on arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one just now lord early in the morning having put on my robes and carrying my outer robe bowl i went into savatthi for alms as i was going from house to house for alms i saw a woman suffering a breech birth on seeing her the thought occurred to me how tormented are living beings how tormented are living beings in that case angulimala go to that woman and on arrival say to her sister since i was born i do not recall intentionally killing a living being through this truth may there be wellbeing for you wellbeing for your fetus but lord wouldn t that be a lie for me for i have intentionally killed many living beings then in that case angulimala go to that woman and on arrival say to her sister since i was born in the noble birth i do not recall intentionally killing a living being through this truth may there be wellbeing for you wellbeing for your fetus responding as you say lord to the blessed one angulimala went to that woman and on arrival said to her sister since i was born in the noble birth i do not recall intentionally killing a living being through this may there be wellbeing for you wellbeing for your fetus and there was wellbeing for the woman wellbeing for her fetus then ven angulimala dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent resolute in no long time reached remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing realizing it for himself in the here now he knew birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for the sake of this world and thus ven angulimala became another one of the arahants then ven angulimala early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his outer robe bowl went into savatthi for alms now at that time a clod thrown by one person hit ven angulimala on the body a stone thrown by another person hit him on the body and a potsherd thrown by still another person hit him on the body so ven angulimala his head broken open and dripping with blood his bowl broken and his outer robe ripped to shreds went to the blessed one the blessed one saw him coming from afar and on seeing him said to him bear with it brahman bear with it the fruit of the kamma that would have burned you in hell for many years many hundreds of years many thousands of years you are now experiencing in the here now then ven angulimala having gone alone into seclusion experienced the bliss of release at that time he exclaimed who once was heedless i the buddha angulimala i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near then a certain monk rising from his seat arranging his robe over one shoulder and placing his hands palm to palm over the heart said to the blessed one lord there is an area where if the blessed one would give me leave i would like the answer to a question very well then monk sit back down in your seat and ask whatever you want responding to the blessed one yes lord the monk sat back down in his seat and said to the blessed one aren t these the five clinging aggregates i e form as a clinging aggregate feeling perception fabrications consciousness as a clinging aggregate monk these are the five clinging aggregates i e form as a clinging aggregate feeling perception fabrications consciousness as a clinging aggregate saying very good lord the monk delighted approved of the blessed one s words and then asked him a further question but in what lord are these five clinging aggregates rooted monk these five clinging aggregates are rooted in desire saying very good lord the monk asked him a further question is clinging the same thing as the five clinging aggregates or is clinging separate from the five clinging aggregates monk clinging is neither the same thing as the five clinging aggregates nor is it separate from the five clinging aggregates just that whatever passion delight is there that s the clinging there saying very good lord the monk asked him a further question might there be diversity in the desire passion for the five clinging aggregates there might monk there is the case where the thought occurs to someone may i be one with such a form in the future may i be one with such a feeling perception fabrications such a consciousness in the future this is how there would be diversity in the desire passion for the five clinging aggregates saying very good lord the monk asked him a further question to what extent does the designation aggregate apply to the aggregates monk whatever form is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of form whatever feeling is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of feeling whatever perception is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of perception whatever fabrications are past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near those are called the aggregate of fabrication whatever consciousness is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of consciousness saying very good lord the monk asked him a further question lord what is the cause what the condition for the delineation there is the case monk where an uninstructed run of the mill person who has no regard for noble ones is not well versed or disciplined in their dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not well versed or disciplined in their dhamma assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form he assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or feeling as in the self or the self as in feeling he assumes perception to be the self or the self as possessing perception or perception as in the self or the self as in perception he assumes fabrications to be the self or the self as possessing fabrications or fabrications as in the self or the self as in fabrications he assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness this monk is how self identity view comes about saying very good lord the monk asked him a further question lord how does self identity view no longer come about there is the case monk where a well instructed disciple of the noble ones who has regard for noble ones is well versed disciplined in their dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is well versed disciplined in their dhamma does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form he does not assume feeling to be the self does not assume perception to be the self does not assume fabrications to be the self he does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness this monk is how self identity view no longer comes about saying very good lord the monk asked him a further question what lord is the allure of form what is its drawback what is the escape from it what is the allure of feeling perception fabrications consciousness what is its drawback what is the escape from it monk whatever pleasure joy arises dependent on form that is the allure of form the fact that form is inconstant stressful subject to change that is the drawback of form the subduing of desire passion the abandoning of desire passion for form that is the escape from form whatever pleasure joy arises dependent on feeling that is the allure of feeling whatever pleasure joy arises dependent on perception that is the allure of perception whatever pleasure joy arises dependent on fabrications that is the allure of fabrications whatever pleasure joy arises dependent on consciousness that is the allure of consciousness the fact that consciousness is inconstant stressful subject to change that is the drawback of consciousness the subduing of desire passion the abandoning of desire passion for consciousness that is the escape from consciousness saying very good lord the monk asked him a further question knowing in what way seeing in what way is there with regard to this body endowed with consciousness and with regard to all external signs no longer any i making or my making or obsession with conceit monk one sees any form whatsoever past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form as it actually is with right discernment this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am one sees any feeling whatsoever any perception whatsoever any fabrications whatsoever one sees any consciousness whatsoever past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness as it actually is with right discernment this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am monk knowing in this way seeing in this way there is with regard to this body endowed with consciousness and with regard to all external signs no longer any i making or my making or obsession with conceit now at that moment this line of thinking appeared in the awareness of a certain monk so form is not self feeling is not self perception is not self fabrications are not self consciousness is not self then what self will be touched by the actions done by what is not self then the blessed one realizing with his awareness the line of thinking in that monk s awareness addressed the monks it s possible that a senseless person immersed in ignorance overcome with craving might think that he could outsmart the teacher s message in this way so form is not self feeling is not self perception is not self fabrications are not self consciousness is not self then what self will be touched by the actions done by what is not self now monks haven t i trained you in counter questioning with regard to this that topic here there what do you think is form constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord is feeling constant or inconstant inconstant lord is perception constant or inconstant inconstant lord are fabrications constant or inconstant inconstant lord what do you think monks is consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord thus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am any feeling whatsoever any perception whatsoever any fabrications whatsoever any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness disenchanted he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is fully released with full release there is the knowledge fully released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words and while this explanation was being given the minds of sixty monks through no clinging not being sustained were fully released from fermentations monks there are these five forms of stinginess which five stinginess as to one s monastery lodgings stinginess as to one s family of supporters stinginess as to one s gains stinginess as to one s status and stinginess as to the dhamma these are the five forms of stinginess and the meanest of these five is this stinginess as to the dhamma thus have i heard at one time the blessed one was staying at savatthi in jeta s grove anathapindika s pleasance the blessed one addressed the bhikkhus saying bhikkhus and they replied to him saying reverend sir the blessed one spoke as follows five things should be reflected on from time to time by the bhikkhu who is intent on the higher consciousness what five when evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion arise in a bhikkhu through reflection on an adventitious object he should in order to get rid of that reflect on a different object which is connected with skill then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear by their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within his subject of meditation like an experienced carpenter or carpenter s apprentice striking hard at pushing out and getting rid of a coarse peg with a fine one should the bhikkhu in order to get rid of the adventitious object reflect on a different object which is connected with skill then the evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion are eliminated they disappear by their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within his subject of meditation if the evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu who in order to get rid of an adventitious object reflects on a different object which is connected with skill he should ponder on the disadvantages of unskillful thoughts thus truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful blameworthy and productive of misery then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear by their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within his subject of meditation like a well dressed young man or woman who feels horrified humiliated and disgusted because of the carcass of a snake dog or human that is hung round his or her neck should the bhikkhu in whom unskillful thoughts continue to arise in spite of his reflection on the object which is connected with skill ponder on the disadvantages of unskillful thoughts thus truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful blameworthy and productive of misery then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear by their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within his subject of meditation if evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu who ponders on their disadvantageousness he should in regard to them endeavor to be without attention and reflection then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear by their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within his subject of meditation like a keen eyed man shutting his eyes and looking away from some direction in order to avoid seeing visible objects come within sight should the bhikkhu in whom evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in spite of his pondering on their disadvantageousness endeavor to be without attention and reflection as regards them then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear by their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within his subject of meditation if evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu in spite of his endeavor to be without attention and reflection as regards evil unskillful thoughts he should reflect on the removal of the thought source of those unskillful thoughts then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear by their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within his subject of meditation just as a man finding no reason for walking fast walks slowly finding no reason for walking slowly stands finding no reason for standing sits down finding no reason for sitting down lies down and thus getting rid of a posture rather uncalm resorts to a restful posture just so should the bhikkhu in whom evil unskillful thoughts arise in spite of his endeavor to be without attention and reflection regarding them reflect on the removal of the thought source of those unskillful thoughts then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated they disappear by their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within his subject of meditation if evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in a bhikkhu in spite of his reflection on the removal of a source of unskillful thoughts he should with clenched teeth and the tongue pressing on the palate restrain subdue and beat down the evil mind by the good mind then the evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion are eliminated they disappear by their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within his subject of meditation like a strong man holding a weaker man by the head or shoulders and restraining subduing and beating him down should the bhikkhu in whom evil unskillful thoughts continue to arise in spite of his reflection on the source of unskillful thoughts restrain subdue and beat down the evil mind by the good mind with clenched teeth and the tongue pressing on the palate then the evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion are eliminated they disappear by their elimination the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within his subject of meditation when indeed bhikkhus evil unskillful thoughts due to reflection on an adventitious object are eliminated when they disappear and the mind stands firm settles down becomes unified and concentrated just within his subject of meditation through his reflection on an object connected with skill through his pondering on the disadvantages of unskillful thoughts his endeavoring to be without attentiveness and reflection as regards those thoughts or through his restraining subduing and beating down of the evil mind by the good mind with clenched teeth and tongue pressing on the palate that bhikkhu is called a master of the paths along which thoughts travel the thought he wants to think that he thinks the thought he does not want to think that he does not think he has cut down craving removed the fetter rightly mastered pride and made an end of suffering the blessed one said this and the bhikkhus glad at heart approved of his words i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in monks the all is aflame what all is aflame the eye is aflame forms are aflame consciousness at the eye is aflame contact at the eye is aflame and whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye experienced as pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain that too is aflame aflame with what aflame with the fire of passion the fire of aversion the fire of delusion aflame i tell you with birth aging death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses despairs the ear is aflame sounds are aflame the nose is aflame aromas are aflame the tongue is aflame flavors are aflame the body is aflame tactile sensations are aflame the intellect is aflame ideas are aflame consciousness at the intellect is aflame contact at the intellect is aflame and whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect experienced as pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain that too is aflame aflame with what aflame with the fire of passion the fire of aversion the fire of delusion aflame i say with birth aging death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses despairs seeing thus the well instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with the eye disenchanted with forms disenchanted with consciousness at the eye disenchanted with contact at the eye and whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye experienced as pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain with that too he grows disenchanted he grows disenchanted with the ear he grows disenchanted with the nose he grows disenchanted with the tongue he grows disenchanted with the body he grows disenchanted with the intellect disenchanted with ideas disenchanted with consciousness at the intellect disenchanted with contact at the intellect and whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect experienced as pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain he grows disenchanted with that too disenchanted he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is fully released with full release there is the knowledge fully released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted at his words and while this explanation was being given the hearts of the monks through no clinging not being sustained were fully released from fermentation effluents i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery now on that occasion in the pitch black darkness of the night the blessed one was sitting in the open air while oil lamps were burning and on that occasion many flying insects flying into around those lamps were meeting their downfall meeting their misfortune meeting their downfall misfortune in those oil lamps the blessed one saw those flying insects flying into around those lamps meeting their downfall meeting their misfortune meeting their downfall misfortune in those oil lamps then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed rushing headlong missing what s essential bringing on one new bond after another they fall like insects into a flame those intent on things seen things heard on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the sakyans at kapilavatthu in the banyan park now at that time many monks were at work making robes for the blessed one thinking when the robes are finished at the end of the three months the blessed one will set out wandering mahanama a discerning lay follower be reassured friend that you have verified confidence in the dhamma the dhamma is well expounded by the blessed one to be seen here now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselves be reassured friend that you have verified confidence in the sangha the sangha of the blessed one s disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straight forwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully in other words the four pairs the eight individuals they are the sangha of the blessed one s disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the incomparable field of merit for the world be reassured friend that you have virtues that are appealing to the noble ones untorn unbroken unspotted unsplattered liberating praised by the wise untarnished leading to concentration mahanama when a discerning lay follower who is diseased in pain severely ill has been reassured by another discerning lay follower with these four reassurances he should be asked friend are you concerned for your mother father if he should say i am concerned for my mother father he should be told you my dear friend are subject to death if you feel concern for your mother father you re still going to die if you don t feel concern for your mother father you re still going to die it would be good if you abandoned concern for your mother father if he should say my concern for my mother father has been abandoned he should be asked friend are you concerned for your wife children if he should say i am concerned for my wife children he should be told you my dear friend are subject to death if you feel concern for your wife children you re still going to die if you don t feel concern for your wife children you re still going to die it would be good if you abandoned concern for your wife children if he should say my concern for my wife children has been abandoned he should be asked friend are you concerned for the five strings of human sensuality if he should say i am concerned for the five strings of human sensuality he should be told friend divine sensual pleasures are more splendid more refined than human sensual pleasures it would be good if having raised your mind above human sensual pleasures you set it on the devas of the four great kings if he should say my mind is raised above human sensual pleasures and is set on the devas of the four great kings he should be told friend the devas of the thirty three are more splendid more refined than the devas of the four great kings it would be good if having raised your mind above the devas of the four great kings you set it on the devas of the thirty three if he should say my mind is raised above the devas of the four great kings and is set on the devas of the thirty three he should be told friend the devas of the hours are more splendid more refined than the devas of the thirty three it would be good if having raised your mind above the devas of the thirty three you set it on the devas of the hours if he should say my mind is raised above the devas of the thirty three and is set on the devas of the hours he should be told friend the contented devas are more splendid more refined than the devas of the hours the devas delighting in creation are more splendid more refined than the contented devas the devas wielding power over the creations of others are more splendid more refined than the devas delighting in creation the brahma world is more splendid and more refined than the devas wielding power over the creations of others it would be good if having raised your mind above the devas wielding power over the creations of others you set it on the brahma world if he should say my mind is raised above the devas wielding power over the creations of others and is set on the brahma world he should be told friend even the brahma world is inconstant impermanent included in self identity it would be good if having raised your mind above the brahma world you brought it to the cessation of self identity if he should say my mind is raised above the brahma worlds and is brought to the cessation of self identity then i tell you mahanama there is no difference in terms of release between the release of that lay follower whose mind is released and the release of a monk whose mind is released on one occasion the blessed one was staying at jeta s grove yes lord the monks responded to him the blessed one said monks once the devas asuras were arrayed for battle then if you can t catch sight of the top of my standard then you should catch sight of the top of the deva king if you can t catch sight of the top of the deva king pajapati s standard then you should catch sight of the top of the deva king if you can t catch sight of the top of the deva king varuna s standard then you should catch sight of the top of the deva king but monks when the top of the deva chief sakka s standard is caught sight of or when the top of the deva king pajapati s standard is caught sight of or when the top of the deva king varuna s standard is caught sight of or when the top of the deva king isana s standard is caught sight of whatever fear terror or horripilation there is may be abandoned or may that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher further said this in the wilderness in the shade of a tree in an empty building monks recollect the buddha your fear won t exist if you can t recall the buddha best in the world the bull of men then you should recall the dhamma leading outward well taught if you can t recall the dhamma leading outward well taught then you should recall the sangha the field of merit unexcelled when thus recalling the buddha dhamma sangha monks there ll be no horripilation terror or fear i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him uttara does the brahman parasiri teach his followers the development of the faculties yes master gotama he does and how does he teach his followers the development of the faculties there is the case where one does not see forms with the eye or hear sounds with the ear in a trance of non perception that s how the brahman parasiri teaches his followers the development of the faculties that being the case uttara then a blind person will have developed faculties and a deaf person will have developed faculties according to the words of the brahman parasiri for a blind person does not see forms with the eye and a deaf person does not hear sounds with the ear when this was said the young brahman uttara sat silent abashed his shoulders slumped his head down brooding at a loss for words the blessed one noticing that uttara was sitting silent abashed his shoulders slumped his head down brooding at a loss for words said to now is the time o blessed one now is the time o one well gone for the blessed one to teach the unexcelled development of the faculties in the discipline of the noble one having heard the blessed one the monks will remember it in that case ananda listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord ven ananda responded to the blessed one the blessed one said now how ananda in the discipline of a noble one is there the unexcelled development of the faculties there is the case where when seeing a form with the eye there arises in a monk what is agreeable what is disagreeable what is agreeable disagreeable he discerns that this agreeable thing has arisen in me this disagreeable thing this agreeable disagreeable thing has arisen in me and that is compounded gross dependently co arisen but this is peaceful this is exquisite i e equanimity with that the arisen agreeable thing disagreeable thing agreeable disagreeable thing ceases and equanimity takes its stance furthermore when hearing a sound with the ear there arises in a monk what is agreeable what is disagreeable what is agreeable disagreeable he discerns that this agreeable thing has arisen in me this disagreeable thing this agreeable disagreeable thing has arisen in me and that

equanimity takes its stance furthermore when smelling an aroma with the nose there arises in a monk what is agreeable what is disagreeable what is agreeable disagreeable he discerns that this agreeable thing has arisen in me this disagreeable thing this agreeable disagreeable thing has arisen in me and that is compounded gross dependently co arisen but this is peaceful this is exquisite i e equanimity with that the arisen agreeable thing disagreeable thing agreeable disagreeable thing ceases and equanimity takes its stance furthermore when tasting a flavor with the tongue there arises in a monk what is agreeable what is disagreeable what is agreeable disagreeable he discerns that this agreeable thing has arisen in me this disagreeable thing this agreeable disagreeable thing has

in a monk what is agreeable what is disagreeable what is agreeable disagreeable he feels horrified humiliated disgusted with the arisen agreeable thing disagreeable thing agreeable disagreeable thing when hearing a sound with the ear when smelling an aroma with the nose when tasting a flavor with the tongue when touching a tactile sensation with the body when cognizing an idea with the intellect there arises in him what is agreeable what is disagreeable what is agreeable disagreeable he feels horrified humiliated disgusted with the arisen agreeable thing disagreeable thing agreeable

touching a tactile sensation with the body when cognizing an idea with the intellect there arises in him what is agreeable what is disagreeable what is agreeable disagreeable if he wants he remains percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome if he wants he remains percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome if he wants he remains percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome what is if he wants he remains percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome what is not if he wants in the presence of what is loathsome what is not cutting himself off from both he remains equanimous alert mindful this is how one is a noble one with developed faculties so ananda i have taught you the unexcelled development of the faculties in the discipline of a noble one i have taught you how one is a person in training someone following the way i have taught you how one is a noble one with developed faculties whatever a teacher should do seeking the welfare of his disciples out of sympathy for them that have i done for you over there are the roots of trees over there empty dwellings practice jhana ananda don t be heedless don t later fall into regret this is our message to you all that is what the blessed one said gratified ven ananda delighted in the blessed one s words because so monks this holy life is lived with training as a reward with discernment as its surpassing state with release as its heartwood and with mindfulness as its governing principle and how is training a reward there is the case where the training i have formulated for my disciples with regard to good conduct is for the arousing of faith in those without faith and for the increase of the faithful and however i have formulated the training for my disciples with regard to good conduct for the arousing of faith in those without faith and for the increase of the faithful one behaves in a way that is untorn in line with that training unbroken unspotted unsplattered having undertaken them one trains in line with the training rules and further the training i have formulated for my disciples with regard to the basics of the holy life is entirely for the right ending of suffering stress and however i have formulated the training for my disciples with regard to the basics of the holy life for the right ending of suffering stress one behaves in a way that is untorn in line with that training unbroken unspotted unsplattered having undertaken them one trains in line with the training rules this is how training is a reward and how is discernment the surpassing state there is the case where the dhammas i have pointed out to my disciples are entirely for the right ending of suffering stress and however i have pointed out dhammas for my disciples entirely for the right ending of suffering stress one has scrutinized them all with discernment this is how discernment is the surpassing state and how is release the heartwood there is the case where the dhammas i have pointed out to my disciples are entirely for the right ending of suffering stress and however i have pointed out dhammas for my disciples entirely for the right ending of suffering stress one has touched them all through release this is how release is the heartwood and how is mindfulness the governing principle the mindfulness that i will make complete any training with regard to good conduct that is not yet complete or i will protect with discernment any training with regard to good conduct that is complete is well established right within the mindfulness that i will make complete any training with regard to the basics of the holy life that is not yet complete or i will protect with discernment any training with regard to the basics of the holy life that is complete is well established right within the mindfulness that i will scrutinize with discernment any dhamma that is not yet scrutinized or i will protect with discernment any dhamma that has been scrutinized is well established right within the mindfulness that i will touch through release any dhamma that is not yet touched or i will protect with discernment any dhamma that has been touched is well established right within this is how mindfulness is the governing principle monks this holy life is lived with training as a reward with discernment as its surpassing state with release as its heartwood and with mindfulness as its governing principle thus it was said and in reference to this was it said the venerable ananda arose early one morning and taking up his robe and bowl approached a certain settlement of nuns where he sat down on a seat that had been prepared a number of nuns approached the venerable ananda and after greeting him sat down to one side so seated these nuns said this to the venerable ananda there are here ananda sir a number of nuns who abide with minds well established in the four foundations of mindfulness their understanding is becoming ever greater and more excellent so it is sisters so it is replied ananda indeed for anybody sisters whether monk or nun who abides with a mind well established in the four foundations of mindfulness it is to be expected that their understanding becomes ever greater and more excellent here ananda a monk abides contemplating body as bodyand what is undirected meditation not directing his mind outward a monk understands my mind is not directed outward he understands not focused on before or after free undirected and he understands i abide observing body as body ardent fully aware mindful i am content this is undirected meditation and so ananda i have taught directed meditation and i have taught undirected meditation whatever is to be done by a teacher with compassion for the welfare of students that has been done by me out of compassion for you here are the roots of trees here are empty places get down and meditate don t be lazy don t become one who is later remorseful this is my instruction to you i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the mahanama that very mental quality even though a disciple of the noble ones has clearly seen as it actually is with right discernment that sensuality is of much stress much despair greater drawbacks still if he has not attained a rapture pleasure apart from sensuality apart from unskillful mental qualities or something more peaceful than that i myself before my awakening when i was still an unawakened bodhisatta saw as it actually was with right discernment that sensuality is of much stress much despair greater drawbacks but as long as i had not attained a rapture pleasure apart from sensuality apart from unskillful mental qualities or something more peaceful than that i did not claim that i could not be tempted by sensuality but when i saw as it actually was with right discernment that sensuality is of much stress much despair greater drawbacks and i had attained a rapture pleasure apart from sensuality apart from unskillful mental qualities or something more peaceful than that that was when i claimed that i could not be tempted by sensuality now what mahanama is the allure of sensuality these five strings of sensuality which five forms cognizable via the eye agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing sounds cognizable via the ear aromas cognizable via the nose flavors cognizable via the tongue tactile sensations cognizable via the body agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing now whatever pleasure or joy arises in dependence on these five strands of sensuality that is the allure of sensuality and what is the drawback of sensuality there is the case where on account of the occupation by which a clansman makes a living whether checking or accounting or calculating or plowing or trading or cattle tending or archery or as a king s man or whatever the occupation may be he faces cold he faces heat being harassed by mosquitoes flies wind sun creeping things dying from hunger thirst now this drawback in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality if the clansman gains no wealth while thus working striving making effort he sorrows grieves laments beats his breast becomes distraught my work is in vain my efforts are fruitless now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality if the clansman gains wealth while thus working striving making effort he experiences pain distress in protecting it how will neither kings nor thieves make off with my property nor fire burn it nor water sweep it away nor hateful heirs make off with it and as he thus guards and watches over his property kings or thieves make off with it or fire burns it or water sweeps it away or hateful heirs make off with it and he sorrows grieves laments beats his breast becomes distraught what was mine is no more now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source sensuality for the cause the reason being simply sensuality that kings quarrel with kings nobles with nobles brahmans with brahmans householders with householders mother with child child with mother father with child child with father brother with brother sister with sister brother with sister sister with brother friend with friend and then in their quarrels brawls disputes they attack one another with fists or with clods or with sticks or with knives so that they incur death or deadly pain now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that men taking swords shields and buckling on bows quivers charge into battle massed in double array while arrows spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are wounded by arrows spears and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly pain now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that men taking swords shields and buckling on bows quivers charge slippery bastions while arrows spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are splashed with boiling cow dung and crushed under heavy weights and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly pain now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that men break into windows seize plunder commit burglary ambush highways commit adultery and when they are captured kings have them tortured in many ways they flog them with whips beat them with canes beat them with clubs they cut off their hands cut off their feet cut off their hands feet they cut off their ears cut off their noses cut off their ears noses they subject them to the porridge pot the polished shell shave the rahu s mouth the flaming garland the blazing hand the grass duty ascetic the bark dress ascetic the burning antelope the meat hooks the coin gouging the lye pickling the pivot on a stake the rolled up bed they have them splashed with boiling oil devoured by dogs impaled alive on stakes they have their heads cut off with swords so that they incur death or deadly pain now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that people engaged in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct having engaged in bodily verbal and mental misconduct they on the break up of the body after death re appear in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress in the future life has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality once mahanama when i was staying near when this was said i asked them but friends do you know that you existed in the past and that you did not not exist no friend and do you know that you did evil actions in the past and that you did not not do them no friend and do you know that you did such and such evil actions in the past no friend and do you know that so and so much stress has been exhausted or that so and so much stress remains to be exhausted or that with the exhaustion of so and so much stress all stress will be exhausted no friend but do you know what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the here now no friend so friends it seems that you don t know that you existed in the past and that you did not not exist you don t know that you did evil actions in the past and that you did not not do them you don t know that you did such and such evil actions in the past you don t know that so and so much stress has been exhausted or that so and so much stress remains to be exhausted or that with the exhaustion of so and so much stress all stress will be exhausted you don t know what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the here now that being the case those in the world who are murderers bloody handed doers of what is cruel when they are later reborn among human beings go forth with the niganthas but friend gotama it s not the case that pleasure is to be attained through pleasure pleasure is to be attained through pain for if pleasure were to be attained through pleasure then surely the venerable niganthas said that rashly and without reflecting for instead i should be asked who lives in greater pleasure king seniya bimbisara of magadha or venerable gotama yes friend gotama we said that rashly and without reflecting but let that be we now ask you venerable gotama who lives in greater pleasure king seniya bimbisara of magadha or venerable gotama in that case niganthas i will question you in return answer as you like what do you think can king seniya bimbisara of magadha without moving his body without uttering a word dwell sensitive to unalloyed pleasure for seven days nights no friend for six days nights for five days nights for a day a night no friend now i without moving my body without uttering a word can dwell sensitive to unalloyed pleasure for a day and a night for two days nights for three four five six seven days nights so what do you think that being the case who dwells in greater pleasure king seniya bimbisara of magadha or me that being the case venerable gotama dwells in greater pleasure than king seniya bimbisara of magadha that is what the blessed one said gratified mahanama the sakyan delighted in the blessed one s words monks a person

person is characterized by his her actions it is through the activities of one s life that one s discernment shines a person endowed with three things is to be recognized as a fool which three bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct a person endowed with these three things is to be recognized as a fool a person endowed with three things is to be recognized as a wise person which

three things that endowed with which one is to be recognized as a fool we will undertake maintain the three things that endowed with which one is to be recognized as a wise person that s how you should train yourselves it s a gain for you monks a great gain that you ve gained the opportunity to live the holy life i have seen a hell named six spheres of contact whatever form one sees there

pleasing never displeasing agreeable never disagreeable it s a gain for you monks a great gain that you ve gained the opportunity to live the holy life staying at savatthi monks there once was a time when the dasarahas had a large drum called summoner whenever summoner was split the dasarahas inserted another peg in it until the time came when summoner s original wooden body had disappeared and only a conglomeration of pegs remained in the same way in the course of the future there will be monks who won t listen when discourses that are words of the tathagata deep deep in their meaning transcendent connected with emptiness are being recited they won t lend ear won t set their hearts on knowing them won t regard these teachings as worth grasping or mastering but they will listen when discourses that are literary works the works of poets elegant in sound elegant in rhetoric the work of outsiders words of disciples are recited they will lend ear and set their hearts on knowing them they will regard these teachings as worth grasping mastering in this way the disappearance of the discourses that are words of the tathagata deep deep in their meaning transcendent connected with emptiness will come about thus you should train yourselves we will listen when discourses that are words of the tathagata deep deep in their meaning transcendent connected with emptiness are being recited we will lend ear will set our hearts on knowing them will regard these teachings as worth grasping mastering that s how you should train yourselves as the flower of a lotus arisen in water blossoms pure scented and pleasing the mind yet is not drenched by the water in the same way born in the world the buddha abides in the world and like the lotus by water he does not get drenched by the world there are brahman these five sense faculties which do not share in each other s sphere of action mind is their resort and it is mind that profits from their combined activity but good gotama what is mind s resort mind s resort brahman is mindfulness then good gotama what is the resort of mindfulness the resort of mindfulness brahman is liberation then good gotama what is the resort of liberation the resort of liberation is nibbaana then good gotama what is the resort of nibbaana that question goes too far brahman no answer can encompass it the aim of the holy life brahman is immersionthe brahman u n naabha was delighted with the words of the blessed one and rejoiced in them he rose saluted the blessed one and departed not long after his departure the blessed one said to the monks monks imagine a house or a pavilion with a peaked roof with a window to the east when the sun rises and its rays strike through the window what do they rest on on the western wall lord just so monks the faith of the brahman u n naabha is settled on the tathaagata rooted in him established in him it is strong and cannot be uprooted by any recluse or brahman deva or maara brahmaa or anyone else in the world monks if the brahman u n naabha were to die now at savatthi as he was sitting to one side king pasenadi kosala said to the blessed one just now lord while i was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in my awareness few are those people in the world who when acquiring lavish wealth don t become intoxicated heedless don t become greedy for sensual pleasures and don t mistreat other beings many more are those who when acquiring lavish wealth become intoxicated heedless become greedy for sensual pleasures and mistreat other beings that s the way it is great king that s the way it is few are those people in the world who when acquiring lavish wealth don t become intoxicated heedless don t become greedy for sensual pleasures and don t mistreat other beings many more are those who when acquiring lavish wealth become intoxicated heedless become greedy for sensual pleasures and mistreat other beings that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further impassioned with sensual possessions greedy dazed by sensual pleasures they don t awaken to the fact that they ve gone too far like deer into a trap laid out afterwards it s bitter for them evil for them the result monks there are these five benefits of walking up down one is fit for long journeys one is fit for striving one has little disease that which is eaten drunk chewed tasted goes through proper digestion the composure attained by walking up down is long lasting these monks are the five benefits of walking up down hemaka the buddha then long life is welcome agreeable pleasant hard to obtain in the world beauty is welcome agreeable pleasant hard to obtain in the world happiness is welcome agreeable pleasant hard to obtain in the world status is welcome agreeable pleasant hard to obtain in the world rebirth in heaven is welcome agreeable pleasant hard to obtain in the world now i tell you these five things are not to be obtained by reason of prayers or wishes if they were to be obtained by reason of prayers or wishes who here would lack them it s not fitting for the disciple of the noble ones who desires long life to pray for it or to delight in doing so instead the disciple of the noble ones who desires long life should follow the path of practice leading to long life in so doing he will attain long life either human or divine it s not fitting for the disciple of the noble ones who desires beauty to pray for it or to delight in doing so instead the disciple of the noble ones who desires beauty should follow the path of practice leading to beauty in so doing he will attain beauty either human or divine it s not fitting for the disciple of the noble ones who desires happiness to pray for it or to delight in doing so instead the disciple of the noble ones who desires happiness should follow the path of practice leading to happiness in so doing he will attain happiness either human or divine it s not fitting for the disciple of the noble ones who desires status to pray for it or to delight in doing so instead the disciple of the noble ones who desires status should follow the path of practice leading to status in so doing he will attain status either human or divine it s not fitting for the disciple of the noble ones who desires rebirth in heaven to pray for it or to delight in doing so instead the disciple of the noble ones who desires rebirth in heaven should follow the path of practice leading to rebirth in heaven in so doing he will attain rebirth in heaven long life beauty status honor heaven high birth to those who delight in aspiring for these things in great measure continuously the wise praise heedfulness in making merit the wise person heedful acquires a two fold welfare welfare in this life welfare in the next by breaking through to his welfare he s called prudent wise once the blessed one was staying at the leaves in the hand of the blessed one are few in number lord those overhead in the simsapa forest are more numerous in the same way monks those things that i have known with direct knowledge but have not taught are far more numerous than what i have taught and why haven t i taught them because they are not connected with the goal do not relate to the rudiments of the holy life and do not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to self awakening to unbinding that is why i have not taught them and what have i taught this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress this is what i have taught and why have i taught these things because they are connected with the goal relate to the rudiments of the holy life and lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to self awakening to unbinding this is why i have taught them therefore your duty is the contemplation this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress your duty is the contemplation this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress at savatthi monks forms are inconstant changeable alterable sounds aromas flavors tactile sensations ideas are inconstant changeable alterable one who has conviction belief that these phenomena are this way is called a faith follower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the run of the mill he is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry shades he is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry one who after pondering with a modicum of discernment has accepted that these phenomena are this way is called a dhamma follower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the run of the mill he is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry shades he is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry one who knows and sees that these phenomena are this way is called a stream enterer steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for self awakening lord that is not to be answered with a categorical answer in that case ananda give an analytical answer when by following a life of precept practice a life a holy life that is followed as of essential worth one s unskillful mental qualities increase while one s skillful mental qualities decline that sort of precept practice life holy life that is followed as of essential worth is fruitless but when by following a life of precept practice a life a holy life that is followed as of essential worth one s unskillful mental qualities decline while one s skillful mental qualities increase that sort of precept practice life holy life that is followed as of essential worth is fruitful that is what ven ananda said and the teacher approved then ven ananda realizing the teacher approves of me got up from his seat and having bowed down to the blessed one and circumambulating him left then not long after ven ananda had left the blessed one said to the monks monks ananda is still in training but it would not be easy to find his equal in discernment a fatal thing monks are gains favors and fame a bitter harsh impediment to the attainment of the unsurpassed freedom from bondage it is just like a beetle in the same way monks if some monk is overwhelmed with gains favors and fame so that his head is turned so having risen early and taken his robe and bowl and gone for alms to the village or market town he eats his fill gets invited again for next day and has a full bowl then he goes to the monks park monks these six properties are means of escape which six there is the case where a monk might say although good will has been developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated and well undertaken by me as my awareness release still ill will keeps overpowering my mind he should be told don t say that you shouldn t speak in that way don t misrepresent the blessed one for it s not right to misrepresent the blessed one and the blessed one wouldn t say that it s impossible there is no way that when good will has been developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated and well undertaken as an awareness release ill will would still keep overpowering the mind that possibility doesn t exist for this is the escape from ill will good will as an awareness release furthermore there is the case where a monk might say although compassion has been developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated and well undertaken by me as my awareness release still viciousness keeps overpowering my mind he should be told don t say that you shouldn t speak in that way don t misrepresent the blessed one for it s not right to misrepresent the blessed one and the blessed one wouldn t say that it s impossible there is no way that when compassion has been developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated and well undertaken as an awareness release viciousness would still keep overpowering the mind that possibility doesn t exist for this is the escape from viciousness compassion as an awareness release furthermore there is the case where a monk might say although appreciation has been developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated and well undertaken by me as my awareness release still resentment keeps overpowering my mind he should be told don t say that you shouldn t speak in that way don t misrepresent the blessed one for it s not right to misrepresent the blessed one and the blessed one wouldn t say that it s impossible there is no way that when appreciation has been developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated and well undertaken as an awareness release resentment would still keep overpowering the mind that possibility doesn t exist for this is the escape from resentment appreciation as an awareness release furthermore there is the case where a monk might say although equanimity has been developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated and well undertaken by me as my awareness release still passion keeps overpowering my mind he should be told don t say that you shouldn t speak in that way don t misrepresent the blessed one for it s not right to misrepresent the blessed one and the blessed one wouldn t say that it s impossible there is no way that when equanimity has been developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated and well undertaken as an awareness release passion would still keep overpowering the mind that possibility doesn t exist for this is the escape from passion equanimity as an awareness release furthermore there is the case where a monk might say although the signless has been developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated and well undertaken by me as my awareness release still my consciousness follows the drift of signs he should be told don t say that you shouldn t speak in that way don t misrepresent the blessed one for it s not right to misrepresent the blessed one and the blessed one wouldn t say that it s impossible there is no way that when the signless has been developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated and well undertaken as an awareness release consciousness would follow the drift of signs that possibility doesn t exist for this is the escape from all signs the signless as an awareness release furthermore there is the case where a monk might say although i am is gone and i do not assume that i am this still the arrow of uncertainty perplexity keeps overpowering my mind he should be told don t say that you shouldn t speak in that way don t misrepresent the blessed one for it s not right to misrepresent the blessed one and the blessed one wouldn t say that it s impossible there is no way that when i am is gone and i am this is not assumed the arrow of uncertainty perplexity would keep overpowering the mind that possibility doesn t exist for this is the escape from the arrow of uncertainty perplexity the uprooting of the conceit i am these monks are six properties that are means of escape there are these five facts that one should reflect on often whether one is a woman or a man lay or ordained which five i am subject to aging have not gone beyond aging this is the first fact that one should reflect on often whether one is a woman or a man lay or ordained i am subject to illness have not gone beyond illness i am subject to death have not gone beyond death i will grow different separate from all that is dear and appealing to me i am the owner of my actions these are the five facts that one should reflect on often whether one is a woman or a man lay or ordained now based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that i am subject to aging have not gone beyond aging there are beings who are intoxicated with a typical youth s intoxication with youth because of that intoxication with youth they conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mind but when they often reflect on that fact that youth s intoxication with youth will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker now based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that i am subject to illness have not gone beyond illness there are beings who are intoxicated with a typical healthy person s intoxication with health because of that intoxication with health they conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mind but when they often reflect on that fact that healthy person s intoxication with health will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker now based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that i am subject to death have not gone beyond death there are beings who are intoxicated with a typical living person s intoxication with life because of that intoxication with life they conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mind but when they often reflect on that fact that living person s intoxication with life will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker now based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that i will grow different separate from all that is dear and appealing to me there are beings who feel desire and passion for the things they find dear and appealing because of that passion they conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mind but when they often reflect on that fact that desire and passion for the things they find dear and appealing will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker now based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that i am the owner of my actions heir to my actions born of my actions related through my actions and have my actions as my arbitrator whatever i do for good or for evil to that will i fall heir there are beings who conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mind but when they often reflect on that fact that bad conduct in body speech and mind will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker now a disciple of the noble ones considers this i am not the only one subject to aging who has not gone beyond aging to the extent that there are beings past and future passing away and re arising all beings are subject to aging have not gone beyond aging when he she often reflects on this the factors of the path take birth he she sticks with that path develops it cultivates it as he she sticks with that path develops it and cultivates it the fetters are abandoned the obsessions destroyed further a disciple of the noble ones considers this i am not the only one subject to illness who has not gone beyond illness i am not the only one subject to death who has not gone beyond death i am not the only one who will grow different separate from all that is dear and appealing to me a disciple of the noble ones considers this i am not the only one who is owner of my actions heir to my actions born of my actions related through my actions and have my actions as my arbitrator who whatever i do for good or for evil to that will i fall heir to the extent that there are beings past and future passing away and re arising all beings are the owner of their actions heir to their actions born of their actions related through their actions and have their actions as their arbitrator whatever they do for good or for evil to that will they fall heir when he she often reflects on this the factors of the path take birth he she sticks with that path develops it cultivates it as he she sticks with that path develops it and cultivates it the fetters are abandoned the obsessions destroyed subject to birth subject to aging subject to death run of the mill people are repelled by those who suffer from that to which they are subject and if i were to be repelled by beings subject to these things it would not be fitting for me living as they do as i maintained this attitude knowing the dhamma without paraphernalia i overcame all intoxication with health youth life as one who sees renunciation as rest i have heard that on one occasion when i dwell with my mind well established in the at as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said and what monks are clingable phenomena what is clinging form is a clingable phenomenon any desire passion related to it is clinging related to it feeling is a clingable phenomenon any desire passion related to it is clinging related to it perception is a clingable phenomenon any desire passion related to it is clinging related to it fabrications are clingable phenomena any desire passion related to them is clinging related to them consciousness is a clingable phenomenon any desire passion related to it is clinging related to it these are called clingable phenomena this is clinging monks these four traits may be known by means of four other traits which four it s through living together that a person s virtue may be known and then only after a long period not a short period by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive by one who is discerning not by one who is not discerning it s through dealing with a person that his purity may be known and then only after a long period not a short period by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive by one who is discerning not by one who is not discerning it s through adversity that a person s endurance may be known and then only after a long period not a short period by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive by one who is discerning not by one who is not discerning it s through discussion that a person s discernment may be known and then only after a long period not a short period by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive by one who is discerning not by one who is not discerning there is the case where one individual through living with another knows this for a long time this person has been torn broken spotted splattered in his actions he hasn t been consistent in his actions he hasn t practiced consistently with regard to the precepts he is an unprincipled person not a virtuous principled one and then there is the case where one individual through living with another knows this for a long time this person has been untorn unbroken unspotted unsplattered in his actions he has been consistent in his actions he has practiced consistently with regard to the precepts he is a virtuous principled person not an unprincipled one it s through living together that a person s virtue may be known and then only after a long period not a short period by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive by one who is discerning not by one who is not discerning thus was it said and in reference to this was it said there is the case where one individual through dealing with another knows this this person deals one way when one on one another way when with two another way when with three another way when with many his earlier dealings do not jibe with his later dealings he is impure in his dealings not pure and then there is the case where one individual through dealing with another knows this the way this person deals when one on one is the same way he deals when with two when with three when with many his earlier dealings jibe with his later dealings he is pure in his dealings not impure it s through dealing with a person that his purity may be known and then only after a long period not a short period by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive by one who is discerning not by one who is not discerning thus was it said and in reference to this was it said there is the case where a person suffering loss of relatives loss of wealth or loss through disease does not reflect that s how it is when living together in the world that s how it is when gaining a personal identity it s through adversity that a person s endurance may be known and then only after a long period not a short period by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive by one who is discerning not by one who is not discerning thus was it said and in reference to this was it said there is the case where one individual through discussion with another knows this from the way this person rises to an issue from the way he applies his reasoning from the way he addresses a question he is dull not discerning why is that he does not make statements that are deep tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle to be experienced by the wise he cannot declare the meaning teach it describe it set it forth reveal it explain it or make it plain he is dull not discerning and then there is the case where one individual through discussion with another knows this from the way this person rises to an issue from the way he applies his reasoning from the way he addresses a question he is discerning not dull why is that he makes statements that are deep tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle to be experienced by the wise he can declare the meaning teach it describe it set it forth reveal it explain it make it plain he is discerning not dull just as if a man with good eyesight standing on the shore of a body of water were to see a large fish rise the thought would occur to him from the rise of this fish from the break of its ripples from its speed it is a large fish not a small one in the same way one individual in discussion with another knows this from the way this person rises to an issue from the way he applies his reasoning from the way he addresses a question he is discerning not dull it s through discussion that a person s discernment may be known and then only after a long period not a short period by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive by one who is discerning not by one who is not discerning thus was it said and in reference to this was it said these monks are the four traits that may be known by means of these four other traits at savatthi now at that time the blessed one was instructing urging rousing encouraging the monks with a dhamma talk concerning unbinding the monks attentive interested lending ear focusing their entire awareness were listening to the dhamma then the thought occurred to then mara the evil one taking on the form of a farmer with a large plowshare over his shoulder carrying a long goad stick his hair disheveled his clothes made of coarse hemp his feet splattered with mud went to the blessed one and on arrival said hey contemplative have you seen my oxen and what are your oxen evil one mine alone is the eye contemplative mine are forms mine is the sphere of consciousness contact at the eye where can you go to escape me mine alone is the ear the nose the tongue the body mine alone is the intellect contemplative mine are ideas mine is the sphere of consciousness contact at the intellect where can you go to escape me then mara the evil one sad dejected at realizing the blessed one knows me the one well gone knows me vanished right there mara the buddha a monk intent on heightened mind should attend periodically to three themes he should attend periodically to the theme of concentration he should attend periodically to the theme of uplifted energy he should attend periodically to the theme of equanimity if the monk intent on heightened mind were to attend solely to the theme of concentration it is possible that his mind would tend to laziness if he were to attend solely to the theme of uplifted energy it is possible that his mind would tend to restlessness if he were to attend solely to the theme of equanimity it is possible that his mind would not be rightly concentrated for the ending of the fermentations but when he attends periodically to the theme of concentration attends periodically to the theme of uplifted energy attends periodically to the theme of equanimity his mind is pliant malleable luminous not brittle it is rightly centered for the stopping of the fermentations in the same way a monk intent on heightened mind should attend periodically to three themes he should attend periodically to the theme of concentration he should attend periodically to the theme of uplifted energy he should attend periodically to the theme of equanimity if the monk intent on heightened mind were to attend solely to the theme of concentration it is possible that his mind would tend to laziness if he were to attend solely to the theme of uplifted energy it is possible that his mind would tend to restlessness if he were to attend solely to the theme of equanimity it is possible that his mind would not be rightly centered for the stopping of the fermentations but when he attends periodically to the theme of concentration attends periodically to the theme of uplifted energy attends periodically to the theme of equanimity his mind is pliant malleable luminous and not brittle it is rightly centered for the stopping of the fermentations and then whichever of the higher knowledges he turns his mind to know realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants he wields manifold supranormal powers having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one he appears he vanishes he goes unimpeded through walls ramparts and mountains as if through space he dives in and out of the earth as if it were water he walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land sitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged bird with his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon so mighty and powerful he exercises influence with his body even as far as the brahma worlds he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants he hears by means of the divine ear element purified and surpassing the human both kinds of sounds divine and human whether near or far he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants he knows the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with his own awareness he discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passion he discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion he discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion he discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind and a scattered mind as a scattered mind he discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mind he discerns an excelled mind one that is not at the most excellent level as an excelled mind and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind he discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind he discerns a released mind as a released mind and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants he recollects his manifold past lives lit previous homes i e one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion recollecting there i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose there there too i had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life passing away from that state i re arose here thus he remembers his manifold past lives in their modes and details he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants he sees by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human beings passing away and re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma these beings who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell but these beings who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views with the break up of the body after death have re appeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world thus by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human he sees beings passing away and re appearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening if he wants then through the ending of the mental fermentations he remains in the fermentation free awareness release and discernment release having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here and now he can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening thus have i heard at one time the lord was staying near i have heard good aggivessana that if a monk is abiding here diligent ardent self resolute he may attain one pointedness of mind that is so prince that is so prince a monk abiding here diligent ardent self resolute may attain one pointedness of mind it were good if the reverend aggivessana were to teach me i prince am not able to teach you let the reverend aggivessana teach me if i were to teach you let the reverend aggivessana teach me then the novice aciravata taught this is impossible good aggivessana it cannot come to pass that a monk abiding diligent ardent self resolute should attain one pointedness of mind then prince jayasena having declared to the novice aciravata that this was impossible and could not come to pass rising from his seat departed and soon after prince jayasena had departed the novice aciravata approached the lord having approached and greeted the lord he sat down at a respectful distance as he was sitting down at a respectful distance the novice aciravata told the lord the whole of the conversation he had with prince jayasena as far as it had gone when this had been said the lord spoke thus to the novice aciravata yes revered sir but those two elephants or horses or oxen that were to be tamed but that were neither tamed nor trained would these not being tamed attain a tamed stage as do the two elephants or horses or oxen to be tamed that were well tamed well trained no revered sir even so aggivessana that prince jayasena living as he does in the midst of sense pleasures should know or see or attain or realize that which can be known and realized by renunciation such a situation does not exist it is as if aggivessana there were a great mountain slope near a village or a market town which two friends coming hand in hand from that village or market town might approach having approached the mountain slope one friend might remain at the foot while the other might climb to the top then the friend standing at the foot of the mountain slope might speak thus to the one standing on the top my dear what do you see as you stand on the top of the mountain slope he might reply as i stand on the top of the mountain slope i my dear see delightful parks delightful woods delightful stretches of level ground delightful ponds but the other might speak thus this is impossible it cannot come to pass my dear that as you stand on the top of the mountain slope you should see delightful ponds then the friend who had been standing on top of the mountain slope having come down to the foot and taken his friend by the arm making him climb to the top of the mountain slope and giving him a moment in which to regain his breath might speak to him thus now my dear what is it that you see as you stand on the top of the mountain slope he might speak thus i my dear as i stand on the top of the mountain slope see delightful parks delightful ponds he might speak thus just now my dear we understood you to say this is impossible it cannot come to pass that as you stand on the top of the mountain slope you should see delightful ponds but now we understand you to say i my dear as i stand on the top of the mountain slope see delightful parks delightful ponds he might speak thus that was because i my dear hemmed in by this great mountain slope could not see what was to be seen even so but to a still greater degree aggivessana is prince jayasena hemmed in blocked obstructed enveloped by this mass of ignorance indeed that prince jayasena living as he does in the midst of sense pleasures enjoying sense pleasures being consumed by thoughts of sense pleasures eager in the search for sense pleasures should know or see or attain or realize that which can be known seen attained realized by renunciation such a situation does not exist had these two similes occurred to you aggivessana for prince jayasena prince jayasena naturally would have acted in the manner of one having trust in you but how could these two similes for prince jayasena have occurred to me revered sir seeing that they are spontaneous that is to say to the lord and have never been heard before as aggivessana a noble anointed king addresses an elephant hunter saying you good elephant hunter mount the king s elephant and go into an elephant forest when you see a forest elephant tie him to the neck of the king s elephant and aggivessana the elephant hunter having answered yes sire in assent to the noble anointed king mounts the king s elephant and goes into an elephant forest seeing a forest elephant he ties him to the neck of the king s elephant so the king s elephant brings him out into the open but aggivessana the forest elephant has this longing that is to say for the elephant forest but in regard to him the elephant hunter tells the noble anointed king that the forest elephant has got out into the open the noble anointed king then addresses an elephant tamer saying come you good elephant tamer tame the forest elephant by subduing his forest ways by subduing his forest memories and aspirations and by subduing his distress his fretting and fever for the forest by making him pleased with the villages and by accustoming him to human ways and aggivessana the elephant tamer having answered yes sire in assent to the noble anointed king driving a great post into the ground ties the forest elephant to it by his neck so as to subdue his forest ways and accustom him to human ways then the elephant tamer addresses him with such words as are gentle pleasing to the ear affectionate going to the heart urbane pleasant to the manyfolk liked by the manyfolk and aggivessana the forest elephant on being addressed with words that are gentle liked by the manyfolk listens lends ear and bends his mind to learning next the elephant tamer supplies him with grass fodder and water when aggivessana the forest elephant has accepted the grass fodder and water from the elephant tamer it occurs to the elephant tamer the king s elephant will now live then the elephant tamer makes him do a further task saying take up put down when aggivessana the king s elephant is obedient to the elephant tamer and acts on his instructions to take up and put down then the elephant tamer makes him do a further task saying get up sit down when aggivessana the king s elephant is obedient to the elephant tamer and acts on his instructions to get up and sit down then the elephant tamer makes him do a further task known as standing your ground he ties a shield to the great beast s trunk a man holding a lance is sitting on his neck and men holding lances are standing surrounding him on all sides and the elephant tamer holding a lance with a long shaft is standing in front while he is doing the task of standing your ground he does not move a fore leg nor does he move a hind leg nor does he move the forepart of his body nor does he move the hindpart of his body nor does he move his head nor does he move an ear nor does he move a tusk nor does he move his tail nor does he move his trunk a king s elephant is one who endures blows of sword axe arrow hatchet and the resounding din of drum and kettle drum conch and tam tam he is like purified gold purged of all its dross and impurities fit for a king a royal possession and reckoned as a kingly attribute acquisition of faith even so aggivessana does a tathagata arise here in the world a perfected one fully self awakened one endowed with right knowledge and conduct well farer knower of the worlds the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed the awakened one the lord he makes known this world with the morality but aggivessana sense control and when aggivessana the ariyan disciple is moral lives controlled by the control undertaking them trains himself in the rules of training then the tathagata disciplines him further saying come you monk be guarded as to the doors of the sense organs having seen a having seen a material shape with the eye do not be entranced with the general appearance do not be entranced with the detail for if one dwells with the organ of sight uncontrolled covetousness and dejection evil unskillful states of mind may flow in so fare along controlling it guard the organ of sight achieve control over the organ of sight having heard a sound with the ear having smelt a smell with the nose having savored a taste with the tongue having felt a touch with the body having cognized a mental state with the mind be not entranced by the general appearance be not entranced by the detail for if you dwell with the organ of mind uncontrolled covetousness and dejection evil unskillful states of mind might flow in so fare along with its control guard the organ of mind achieve control over the organ of the mind moderation in eating and when aggivessana the ariyan disciple is guarded as to the doors of the sense organs then the tathagata disciplines him further saying come you monk be moderate in eating you should take food reflecting carefully not for fun or indulgence or personal charm or beautification but taking just enough for maintaining this body and keeping it going for keeping it unharmed for furthering the brahma faring with the thought thus will i crush out an old feeling and i will not allow a new feeling to arise and then there will be for me subsistence and blamelessness and abiding in comfort vigilance when aggivessana the ariyan disciple is moderate in eating the tathagata disciplines him further saying come you monk abide intent on vigilance during the day while pacing up and down while sitting down cleanse the mind of obstructive mental states during the middle watch of the night lie down on the right side in the lion posture foot resting on foot mindful clearly conscious reflecting on the thought of getting up again during the last watch of the night when you have arisen while pacing up and down while sitting down cleanse the mind of obstructive mental states mindfulness and clear consciousness and when aggivessana the ariyan disciple is intent on vigilance then the tathagata disciplines him further saying come you monk be possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousness acting with clear consciousness whether you are approaching or departing acting with clear consciousness whether you are looking ahead or looking round acting with clear consciousness whether you are bending in or stretching out the arms acting with clear consciousness whether you are carrying the outer cloak the bowl or robe acting with clear consciousness whether you are eating drinking munching savoring acting with clear consciousness whether you are obeying the calls of nature acting with clear consciousness whether you are walking standing sitting asleep awake talking or being silent overcoming of the five hindrances and when aggivessana the ariyan disciple is possessed of mindfulness and clear consciousness then the tathagata disciplines him further saying come you monk choose a remote lodging in a forest at the root of a tree on a mountain slope in a wilderness in a hill cave a cemetery a forest haunt in the open or on a heap of straw he chooses a remote lodging in the forest or on a heap of straw returning from alms gathering after the meal he sits down cross legged holding the back erect having made mindfulness rise up in front of him he by getting rid of coveting for the world dwells with a mind devoid of coveting he purifies the mind of coveting by getting rid of the taint of ill will he dwells benevolent in mind compassionate for the welfare of all creatures and beings he purifies the mind of the taint of ill will by getting rid of sloth and torpor he dwells devoid of sloth and torpor perceiving the light mindful clearly conscious he purifies the mind of sloth and torpor by getting rid of restlessness and worry he dwells calmly the mind subjectively tranquilized he purifies the mind of restlessness and worry by getting rid of doubt he dwells doubt crossed unperplexed as to the states that are skillful he purifies the mind of doubt the four applications of mindfulness he by getting rid of these five hindrances which are defilements of the mind and weakening to intuitive wisdom dwells contemplating the body in the body ardent clearly conscious of it mindful of it so as to control the covetousness and dejection in the world he fares along contemplating the feelings the mind the mental states in mental states ardent clearly conscious of them mindful of them so as to control the covetousness and dejection in the world as aggivessana an elephant tamer driving a great post into the ground ties a forest elephant to it by his neck so as to subdue his forest ways so as to subdue his forest aspirations and so as to subdue his distress his fretting and fever for the forest so as to make him pleased with villages and accustom him to human ways even so aggivessana these four applications of mindfulness are ties of the mind so as to subdue the ways of householders and to subdue the aspirations of householders and to subdue the distress the fretting and fever of householders they are for leading to the right path for realizing nibbana the tathagata then disciplines him further saying come you monk fare along contemplating the body in the body but do not apply yourself to a train of thought connected with the body fare along contemplating the feelings in the feelings the mind in the mind mental states in mental states but do not apply yourself to a train of thought connected with mental states jhana he by allaying initial thought and discursive thought with the mind subjectively tranquilized and fixed on one point enters on and abides in the second meditation the three knowledges recollection of former habitations then with the mind composed thus quite purified quite clarified without blemish without defilement grown pliant and workable fixed immovable he directs his mind to the knowledge and recollection of former habitation he remembers a variety of former habitations thus one birth two births three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand births and many an eon of integration and many an eon of disintegration and many an eon of integration disintegration such a one was i by name having such a clan such and such a color so was i nourished such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine so did the span of life end passing from this i came to be in another state where such a one was i by name having such and such a clan such and such a color so was i nourished such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine so did the span of life end passing from this i arose here thus he remembers divers former habitations in all their modes and details the divine eye then with the mind composed quite purified quite clarified without blemish without defilement grown pliant and workable fixed immovable he directs his mind to the knowledge of the passing hence and the arising of beings with the purified destruction of cankers sainthood then with the mind composed immovable he directs his mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers that monk is able to endure heat cold hunger thirst the touch of mosquitoes gadflies wind sun and creeping things abusive language and unwelcome modes of speech he has grown to bear bodily feelings which as they arise are painful acute sharp severe wretched miserable deadly purged of all the dross and impurities of attachment aversion and confusion if aggivessana a king s elephant dies in old age untamed untrained the king s old elephant that has died is reckoned as one that has died untamed and so aggivessana of a king s elephant that is middle aged and too aggivessana if a king s elephant dies young untamed untrained the king s young elephant that has died is reckoned as one that has died untamed even so aggivessana if a monk who is an elder dies with the cankers not destroyed the monk who is an elder that has died is reckoned as one that has died untamed and so of a monk of middle standing and too aggivessana if a newly ordained monk dies with the cankers not destroyed the newly ordained monk that has died is reckoned as one that has died untamed if aggivessana a king s elephant dies in old age well tamed well trained the king s old elephant that has died is reckoned as one that has died tamed and so aggivessana of a king s elephant that is middle aged and too aggivessana if a king s elephant dies young well tamed well trained the king s young elephant that has died is reckoned as one that has died tamed even so aggivessana if a monk who is an elder dies with the cankers destroyed the monk who is an elder that has died is reckoned as one that has died tamed and so aggivessana of a monk of middle standing and too aggivessana if a newly ordained monk dies with cankers destroyed the newly ordained monk that has died is reckoned as one that has died tamed thus spoke the lord delighted the novice aciravata rejoiced in what the lord had said on one occasion the blessed one was staying near then it s certain monks that that monk didn t suffuse the four royal snake lineages with a mind of good will for if he had suffused the four royal snake lineages with a mind of good will he would not have died after having been bitten by a snake which four the i have good will for the virupakkhas good will for the erapathas good will for the chabyaputtas good will for the dark gotamakas i have good will for footless beings good will for two footed beings good will for four footed beings good will for many footed beings may footless beings do me no harm may two footed beings do me no harm may four footed beings do me no harm may many footed beings do me no harm may all creatures all breathing things all beings each every one meet with good fortune may none of them come to any evil limitless is the buddha limitless the dhamma limitless the sangha there is a limit to creeping things snakes scorpions centipedes spiders lizards rats i have made this safeguard i have made this protection may the beings depart i pay homage to the blessed one homage to the seven rightly self awakened ones i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the excellent mahanama excellent it is fitting for clansmen like you to approach the tathagata and ask for those of us living by means of various dwelling places for the mind by means of which dwelling place should we live one who is aroused to practice is one of conviction not without conviction one aroused to practice is one with persistence aroused not lazy one aroused to practice is one of established mindfulness not muddled mindfulness one aroused to practice is centered in concentration not uncentered one aroused to practice is discerning not undiscerning established in these five qualities you should further develop six qualities mahanama you should develop this recollection of the buddha while you are walking while you are standing while you are sitting while you are lying down while you are busy at work while you are resting in your home crowded with children mahanama you should develop this recollection of the dhamma while you are walking while you are standing while you are sitting while you are lying down while you are busy at work while you are resting in your home crowded with children mahanama you should develop this recollection of the sangha while you are walking while you are standing while you are sitting while you are lying down while you are busy at work while you are resting in your home crowded with children mahanama you should develop this recollection of virtue while you are walking while you are standing while you are sitting while you are lying down while you are busy at work while you are resting in your home crowded with children mahanama you should develop this recollection of generosity while you are walking while you are standing while you are sitting while you are lying down while you are busy at work while you are resting in your home crowded with children mahanama you should develop this recollection of the devas while you are walking while you are standing while you are sitting while you are lying down while you are busy at work while you are resting in your home crowded with children yes master gotama why is that the fire is painful to the touch very hot scorching now what do you think magandiya is the fire painful to the touch very hot scorching only now or was it also that way before both now before is it painful to the touch very hot scorching master gotama it s just that when the man was a leper covered with sores and infections devoured by worms picking the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails his faculties were impaired which was why even though the fire was actually painful to the touch he had the skewed perception of pleasant in the same way magandiya sensual pleasures in the past were painful to the touch very hot scorching sensual pleasures in the future will be painful to the touch very hot scorching sensual pleasures at present are painful to the touch very hot scorching but when beings are not free from passion for sensual pleasures devoured by sensual craving burning with sensual fever their faculties are impaired which is why even though sensual pleasures are actually painful to the touch they have the skewed perception of pleasant now suppose that there was a leper covered with sores infections devoured by worms picking the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails cauterizing his body over a pit of glowing embers the more he cauterized his body over the pit of glowing embers the more disgusting foul smelling putrid the openings of his wounds would become and yet he would feel a modicum of enjoyment satisfaction because of the itchiness of his wounds in the same way beings not free from passion for sensual pleasures devoured by sensual craving burning with sensual fever indulge in sensual pleasures the more they indulge in sensual pleasures the more their sensual craving increases and the more they burn with sensual fever and yet they feel a modicum of enjoyment satisfaction dependent on the five strings of sensuality now what do you think magandiya have you ever seen or heard of a king or king s minister enjoying himself provided endowed with the five strings of sensuality without abandoning sensual craving without removing sensual fever who has dwelt or will dwell or is dwelling free from thirst his mind inwardly at peace no master gotama very good magandiya neither have i ever seen or heard of a king or king s minister enjoying himself provided endowed with the five strings of sensuality without abandoning sensual craving without removing sensual fever who has dwelt or will dwell or is dwelling free from thirst his mind inwardly at peace but whatever brahmans or contemplatives who have dwelt or will dwell or are dwelling free from thirst their minds inwardly at peace all have done so having realized as it actually is present the origination disappearance the allure the danger the escape from sensual pleasures having abandoned sensual craving and removed sensual fever then at that moment the blessed one exclaimed freedom from disease the foremost good fortune unbinding the foremost ease the eightfold the foremost of paths going to the deathless secure when this was said magandiya the wanderer said to the blessed one it s amazing master gotama it s astounding how this too is well stated by master gotama freedom from disease the foremost good fortune unbinding the foremost ease we have also heard this said by earlier wanderers in the lineage of our teachers freedom from disease the foremost good fortune unbinding the foremost ease this agrees with that but as for what you have heard said by earlier wanderers in the lineage of your teachers magandiya freedom from disease the foremost good fortune unbinding the foremost ease which freedom from disease is that which unbinding when this was said magandiya the wanderer rubbed his own limbs with his hand this is that freedom from disease master gotama he said this is that unbinding for i am now free from disease happy and nothing afflicts me magandiya it s of course he did it not knowing not seeing master gotama but out of faith in the man with good eyesight in the same way magandiya the wanderers of other sects are blind eyeless without knowing freedom from disease without seeing unbinding they still speak this verse freedom from disease the foremost good fortune unbinding the foremost ease this verse was stated by earlier worthy ones fully self awakened freedom from disease the foremost good fortune unbinding the foremost ease the eightfold the foremost of paths going to the deathless secure but now it has gradually become a verse of run of the mill people this body magandiya is a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction and yet you say with reference to this body which is a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction this is that freedom from disease master gotama this is that unbinding for you don t have the noble vision with which you would know freedom from disease and see unbinding i m convinced master gotama that you can teach me the dhamma in such a way that i would know freedom from disease that i would see unbinding magandiya it s just as if there were a man blind from birth who couldn t see black objects white blue yellow red the sun or the moon his friends companions relatives would take him to a doctor the doctor would concoct medicine for him but in spite of the medicine his eyesight would not appear or grow clear what do you think magandiya would that doctor have nothing but his share of weariness disappointment yes master gotama in the same way magandiya if i were to teach you the dhamma this is that freedom from disease this is that unbinding and you on your part did not know freedom from disease or see unbinding that would be wearisome for me that would be troublesome for me i m convinced master gotama that you can teach me the dhamma in such a way that i would know freedom from disease that i would see unbinding magandiya it s just as if there were a man blind from birth who couldn t see black objects white blue yellow red the sun or the moon now suppose that a certain man were to take a grimy oil stained rag and fool him saying here my good man is a white cloth beautiful spotless clean the blind man would take it and put it on then his friends companions relatives would take him to a doctor the doctor would concoct medicine for him purges from above purges from below ointments counter ointments and treatments through the nose and thanks to the medicine his eyesight would appear grow clear then together with the arising of his eyesight he would abandon whatever passion delight he felt for that grimy oil stained rag and he would regard that man as an enemy no friend at all and think that he deserved to be killed my gosh how long have i been fooled cheated deceived by that man his grimy oil stained rag here my good man is a white cloth beautiful spotless clean in the same way magandiya if i were to teach you the dhamma this is that freedom from disease this is that unbinding and you on your part were to know that freedom from disease and see that unbinding then together with the arising of your eyesight you would abandon whatever passion delight you felt with regard for the five clinging aggregates and it would occur to you my gosh how long have i been fooled cheated deceived by this mind for in clinging it was just form that i was clinging to it was just feeling just perception just fabrications just consciousness that i was clinging to with my clinging as a requisite condition there arises becoming birth aging death sorrow lamentation pains distresses despairs and thus is the origin of this entire mass of stress i m convinced master gotama that you can teach me the dhamma in such a way that i might rise up from this seat cured of my blindness in that case magandiya associate with men of integrity when you associate with men of integrity you will hear the true dhamma when you hear the true dhamma you will practice the dhamma in accordance with the dhamma when you practice the dhamma in accordance with the dhamma you will know see for yourself these things are diseases cancers arrows and here is where diseases cancers arrows cease without trace with the cessation of my clinging comes the cessation of becoming with the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth with the cessation of birth then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair all cease such is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering stress when this was said magandiya the wanderer said anyone magandiya who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires the going forth admission in this doctrine discipline must first undergo probation for four months if at the end of four months the monks feel so moved they give him the going forth admit him to the monk s state but i know distinctions among individuals in this matter master gotama if anyone who has previously belonged to another sect and desires the going forth admission in this doctrine discipline must first undergo probation for four months and if at the end of four months the monks feel so moved they give him the going forth admit him to the monk s state then i am willing to undergo probation for four years if at the end of four years the monks feel so moved let them give me the going forth admit me to the monk s state on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the koliyans now there is a koliyan town named haliddavasa then early in the morning a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and carrying their bowls robes went into haliddavasana for alms then the thought occurred to them it s still too early to go for alms in haliddavasana why don t we go to the park of the wanderers of other sects so the monks went to the park of the wanderers of other sects on arrival they exchanged courteous greetings with the wanderers of other sects after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies they sat to one side as they were sitting there the wanderers of other sects said to them friends gotama the contemplative teaches the dhamma to his disciples in this way come monks abandoning the five hindrances the corruptions of awareness that weaken discernment keep pervading the first direction the east with an awareness imbued with good will likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth thus above below all around everywhere in its entirety keep pervading the all

immeasurable without hostility without ill will so friends what difference what distinction what distinguishing factor is there here between gotama the contemplative and us when comparing dhamma teaching with dhamma teaching instruction with instruction then the monks neither delighted in the words of the wanderers of other sects nor did they reject them without delighting or rejecting they got up from their seats and left thinking we will learn the meaning of these words in the presence of the blessed one so having gone for alms in haliddavasana after the meal returning from their alms round the monks went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they told him what had happened monks when wanderers of other sects speak in that way they should be addressed in this way but how friends is awareness release being asked in this way the wanderers of other sects will be unable to respond and on top of that will fall into vexation why is that because it lies beyond their range monks don t see anyone in this cosmos with its devas maras and brahmas with its people with their contemplatives brahmans their royalty commonfolk who would satisfy the mind with their answer to these questions aside from the tathagata a disciple of the tathagata or one who had heard it from them and how monks is awareness release through good will developed what is its destination what is its excellence its fruit its consummation there is the case where a monk develops and how is awareness release through there is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening accompanied by compassion dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in letting go he develops analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening persistence as a factor for awakening rapture as a factor for awakening serenity as a factor for awakening concentration as a factor for awakening equanimity as a factor for awakening accompanied by compassion dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in letting go if he wants he remains percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome if he wants he remains percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome if he wants he remains percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome what is if he wants he remains percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome what is not if he wants in the presence of what is loathsome what is not cutting himself off from both he remains equanimous alert mindful or with the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving infinite space he enters remains in the sphere of the infinitude of space i tell you monks awareness release through compassion has the sphere of the infinitude of space as its excellence in the case of one who has penetrated to no higher release and how is awareness release through there is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening accompanied by empathetic joy dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in letting go he develops analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening persistence as a factor for awakening rapture as a factor for awakening serenity as a factor for awakening concentration as a factor for awakening equanimity as a factor for awakening accompanied by empathetic joy

mindful or with the complete transcending of the sphere of the infinitude of space perceiving infinite consciousness he enters remains in the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness i tell you monks awareness release through empathetic joy has the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness as its excellence in the case of one who has penetrated to no higher release and how is awareness release through there is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening accompanied by equanimity dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in

nothing he enters remains in the sphere of nothingness i tell you monks awareness release through equanimity has the sphere of nothingness as its excellence in the case of one who has penetrated to no higher release i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near now at that time the elder monks were taking turns in exhorting the nuns but ven nandaka didn t want to exhort the nuns when his turn came so the blessed one addressed ven ananda ananda whose turn is it to exhort the nuns today lord everyone has taken his turn then the blessed one addressed ven nandaka exhort the nuns nandaka instruct the nuns nandaka give the nuns a talk on dhamma brahman as you say lord ven nandaka replied then early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his bowl outer robe he went into as they were sitting there ven nandaka said to them this will be a question response talk sisters where you understand you should say we understand where you don t you should say we don t understand where you are doubtful or perplexed you should question me in response how is this venerable sir what is the meaning of this venerable sir we are gratified delighted that you invite us in this way so then sisters what do you think is the eye constant or inconstant inconstant venerable sir and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful venerable sir and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no venerable sir is the ear constant or inconstant inconstant venerable sir is the nose constant or inconstant inconstant venerable sir is the tongue constant or inconstant inconstant venerable sir is the body constant or inconstant inconstant venerable sir what do you think sisters is the intellect constant or inconstant inconstant venerable sir and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful venerable sir and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no venerable sir why is that because we have already seen it well as it actually is with right discernment that these six internal media are inconstant good good sisters that s how it is for a disciple of the noble ones who has seen it as it actually is with right discernment now what do you think sisters are forms constant or inconstant inconstant venerable sir and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful venerable sir and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no venerable sir are sounds constant or inconstant inconstant venerable sir are aromas constant or inconstant inconstant venerable sir are flavors constant or inconstant inconstant venerable sir are tactile sensations constant or inconstant inconstant venerable sir what do you think sisters are ideas constant or inconstant inconstant venerable sir and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful venerable sir and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no venerable sir why is that because we have already seen it well as it actually is with right discernment that these six external media are also inconstant good good sisters that s how it is for a disciple of the noble ones who has seen it as it actually is with right discernment now what do you think sisters is eye consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant venerable sir and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful venerable sir and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no venerable sir is ear consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant venerable sir is nose consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant venerable sir is tongue consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant venerable sir is body consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant venerable sir what do you think sisters is intellect consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant venerable sir and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful venerable sir and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no venerable sir why is that because we have already seen it well as it actually is with right discernment that these six consciousness groups too are inconstant good good sisters that s how it is for a disciple of the noble ones who has seen it as it actually is with right discernment no venerable sir why is that because the oil in that burning oil lamp is inconstant subject to change its wick is inconstant subject to change its flame is inconstant subject to change so how much more should its light be inconstant subject to change in the same way sisters if someone were to say my six internal media are inconstant but what i experience based on the six internal media pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change would he be speaking rightly no venerable sir why is that because each feeling arises dependent on its corresponding condition with the cessation of its corresponding condition it ceases good good sisters that s how it is for a disciple of the noble ones who has seen it as it actually is with right discernment no venerable sir why is that because the root of that great standing tree possessed of heartwood is inconstant subject to change its trunk is inconstant subject to change its branches foliage are inconstant subject to change so how much more should its shadow be inconstant subject to change in the same way sisters if someone were to say my six external media are inconstant but what i experience based on the six internal media pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change would he be speaking rightly no venerable sir why is that because each feeling arises dependent on its corresponding condition with the cessation of its corresponding condition it ceases good good sisters that s how it is for a disciple of the noble ones who has seen it as it actually is with right discernment no venerable sir why is that because if the skilled butcher or butcher s apprentice having killed a cow were to cut sever detach only the skin muscles connective tissues attachments in between and having covered the cow again with that very skin then no matter how much he might say that the cow was joined to the skin just as it had been the cow would still be disjoined from the skin this simile sisters i have given to convey a message the message is this the substance of the inner flesh stands for the six internal media the substance of the outer hide for the six external media the skin muscles connective tissues attachments in between stand for passion delight and the sharp knife stands for noble discernment the noble discernment that cuts severs detaches the defilements fetters bonds in between sisters there are these seven factors for awakening then having exhorted the nuns with this exhortation ven nandaka dismissed them saying go sisters the time has come the nuns delighting in and approving of ven nandaka s exhortation got up from their seats bowed down to him circumambulated him keeping him to the right and went to the blessed one on arrival having bowed down to the blessed one they stood to one side as they were standing there the blessed one said to them go nuns the time has come so the nuns having bowed down to the blessed one circumambulated him keeping him to the right and departed then not long after the nuns departure the blessed one addressed the monks monks just as on the uposatha day of the fourteenth people at large are not doubtful or perplexed as to whether the moon is lacking or full for it is clearly lacking as you say lord ven nandaka replied then after the night had passed early in the morning having put on his robes and carrying his bowl outer robe he went into rajagaha for alms as before from then the blessed one addressed ven nandaka up to then not long after the nuns departure the blessed one addressed the monks monks just as on the uposatha day of the fifteenth people at large are not doubtful or perplexed as to whether the moon is lacking or full for it is clearly full in the same way the nuns are gratified with nandaka s dhamma teaching and their resolves have been fulfilled of these nuns the most backward is a stream winner not destined for the planes of deprivation headed to self awakening for sure that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words thus have i heard at one time the exalted one was staying near visakha when the uposatha undertaken with its eight component practices here for all their lives the arahants dwell having abandoned killing living beings refrain from killing living beings they have laid down their staffs laid down their weapons they are conscientious it is undertaken by this first practice he considers for all their lives the arahants dwell having abandoned taking what is not given refrain from taking what is not given they are takers of what is given those who expect only what is given themselves become clean without thieving so today i dwell for this night and day having abandoned taking what is not given refraining from taking what is not given i am a taker of what is given one who expects only what is given by myself become clean without thieving by this practice following after the arahants the uposatha will be entered on by me it is undertaken by this second practice he considers for all their lives the arahants dwell having abandoned unchaste conduct they are of chaste conduct living aloof refrain from sex which is the way of common society so today i dwell for this night and day having abandoned unchaste conduct i am of chaste conduct living aloof refraining from sex which is the common way of society by this practice following after the arahants the uposatha will be entered on by me it is undertaken by this third practice he considers for all their lives the arahants dwell having abandoned false speech refrain from false speech they are speakers of truth joiners of truth it is undertaken by this fourth practice he considers for all their lives the arahants dwell having abandoned distilled and fermented intoxicants which are the occasion for carelessness and refrain from them so today i dwell for this night and day having abandoned distilled and fermented intoxicants which are the occasion for carelessness refraining from them by this practice following after the arahants the uposatha will be entered on by me it is undertaken by this fifth practice he considers for all their lives the arahants are one mealers refrain from eating outside the time desisting at night it is undertaken by this sixth practice he considers for all their lives the arahants refrain from dancing singing music going to see entertainments wearing garments smartening with perfumes and beautifying with cosmetics so today i refrain from dancing singing music going to see entertainments wearing ornaments smartening with perfumes and beautifying with cosmetics by this practice following after the arahants the uposatha will be entered on by me it is undertaken by this seventh practice he considers for all their lives the arahants having abandoned high beds it is undertaken by this eighth practice thus indeed visakha is the uposatha entered on and undertaken with its eight component practices of great fruit of great advantage of great splendor of great range how great a fruit how great an advantage how great a splendor how great a range just as though visakha one might have power dominion and kingship that which among men is fifty years visakha is one night and day of the devas of the four great kings their month has thirty of those days their year twelve of those months the lifespan of the devas of the four great kings is five hundred of those heavenly years now here a certain woman or man having entered on the uposatha undertaken with its eight practices at the break up of the body after death may arise to fellowship with the devas of the four great kings such a thing indeed is known visakha it was in connection with this that i have said that which among men is a hundred years visakha is one night and day of the devas of the thirty three their month has thirty of those days their year twelve of those months the lifespan of the devas of the thirty three is one thousand of those heavenly years that which among men is two hundred years visakha is one night and day of the yama devas their month has thirty of those days their year twelve of those months the lifespan of the yama devas is two thousand of those heavenly years now here a certain woman or man having entered on the uposatha undertaken with the eight practices at the break up of the body after death may arise to fellowship with the yama devas such a thing indeed is known visakha it was in connection with this that i have said that which among men is four hundred years visakha is one night and day of the tusita devas their month has thirty of those days their year twelve of those months the lifespan of the tusita devas is four thousand of those heavenly years now here a certain woman or man having entered on the uposatha undertaken with the eight practices at the break up of the body after death may arise to fellowship with the tusita devas such a thing indeed is known visakha it was in connection with this that i have said that which among men is eight hundred years visakha is one night and day of the nimmanarati devas their month has thirty of those days their year twelve of those months the lifespan of the nimmanarati devas is eight thousand of those heavenly years now here a certain woman or man having entered on the uposatha undertaken with the eight practices at the break up of the body after death may arise to fellowship with the nimmanarati devas such a thing indeed is known visakha it was in connection with this that i have said that which among men is sixteen hundred years visakha is one night and day of the paranimmitavasavatti devas their month has thirty of those days their year twelve of those months the lifespan of the paranimmitavasavatti devas is sixteen thousand of those heavenly years now here a certain woman or man having entered on the uposatha undertaken with the eight practices at the break up of the body after death may arise to fellowship with the paranimmitavasavatti devas such a thing indeed is known visakha it was in connection with this that i have said kill no life nor take what is not given speak no lie nor be an alcoholic refrain from sex and unchaste conduct at night do not eat out of time food neither bear garlands nor indulge with perfume and make your bed a mat upon the ground this indeed is called the eight part uposatha taught by the buddha gone to dukkha s end the radiance of the sun and moon both beautiful to see follow on from each other dispelling the darkness as they go through the heavens illumining the sky and brightening the quarters and the treasure found between them pearls and crystals and auspicious turquoises gold nuggets and the gold called ore monetary gold with gold dust carried down compared with the eight part uposatha though they are enjoyed are not a sixteenth part as the shining of the moon in all the groups of stars hence indeed the woman and the man who are virtuous enter on uposatha having eight parts and having made merits pts iv pp then a certain bhikkhu went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one what lord is feeling what is the origination of feeling what is the path of practice leading to the origination of feeling what is the cessation of feeling what is the path of practice leading to the cessation of feeling what is the allure of feeling what is its drawback what is the escape from it monk there are three feelings a feeling of pleasure a feeling of pain a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain these are called feelings contact is the origination of feeling craving is the path of practice leading to feeling from the cessation of contact is the cessation of feeling this very noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of feeling in other words right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration whatever pleasure happiness arise in dependence on feeling that is the allure of feeling the fact that feeling is inconstant stressful subject to change that is the drawback of feeling the subduing of desire passion for feeling the abandoning of desire passion for feeling that is the escape from feeling there are these four wheels endowed with which human beings devas develop a four wheeled prosperity endowed with which human beings devas in no long time achieve greatness abundance in terms of wealth which four living in a civilized land associating with people of integrity directing oneself rightly and having done merit in the past these are the four wheels endowed with which human beings devas develop a four wheeled prosperity endowed with which

in the blessed one s words i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in for us lord the teachings have the blessed one as their root their guide their arbitrator it would be good if the blessed one himself would explicate the meaning of this statement having heard it from the blessed one the monks will remember it in that case monks listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said there is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that i am a learner and whereby a monk who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can discern that i am an adept and what is the manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that i am a learner there is the case where a monk is a learner he discerns as it actually is that this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress this is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that i am a learner furthermore the monk who is a learner reflects is there outside of this doctrine discipline any brahman or contemplative who teaches the true genuine accurate dhamma like the blessed one and he discerns no there is no brahman or contemplative outside of this doctrine discipline who teaches the true genuine accurate dhamma like the blessed one this too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that i am a learner furthermore the monk who is a learner discerns the five faculties the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment he sees clear through with discernment their destiny excellence rewards consummation but he does not touch them with his body this too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that i am a learner and what is the manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can discern that i am an adept there is the case where a monk who is an adept discerns the five faculties the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment he touches with his body and sees clear through with discernment what their destiny excellence rewards consummation are this is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can discern that i am an adept furthermore the monk who is an adept discerns the six sense faculties the faculty of the eye ear nose tongue body intellect he discerns these six sense faculties will disband entirely everywhere in every way without remainder and no other set of six sense faculties will arise anywhere or in any way this too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can discern that i am an adept short indeed is this life this side of a hundred years one dies whoever lives long even he dies from old age people grieve for things they are attached to yet there exist no permanent possessions but just a state of constant separation seeing this one should no longer live the household life that which a man imagines to be his will disappear at death knowing this a wise man will have no attachment to anything as a man awakened from sleep no longer sees what happened in his dream similarly one does not see a loved one who is dead those people who were seen and heard and called by their names as such and such only their names remain when they have passed away those greedy for objects of attachment do not abandon sorrow grief and avarice but sages having got rid of possessions live perceiving security for a bhikkhu with a detached mind living in a secluded dwelling it is right they say that he no longer shows himself in the abodes of existence a sage who is completely independent does not make close friends or enemies in him sorrow and selfishness do not stay like water on a lotus leaf as a lotus is not wetted by water so a sage is not affected by what is seen or heard nor by what is perceived by the other senses a wise man is not deluded by what is perceived by the senses he does not expect purity by any other way in the same way the uninstructed run of the mill person is thrashed in the eye by charming pleasurable forms thrashed in the ear by charming pleasurable sounds thrashed in the nose by charming pleasurable aromas thrashed in the tongue by charming pleasurable flavors thrashed in the body by charming pleasurable tactile sensations thrashed in the intellect by charming pleasurable ideas and if that uninstructed run of the mill person forms intentions for the sake of further becoming in the future then he that foolish person is even more thoroughly thrashed just like the sheaf of barley thrashed with the seventh flail once monks the devas asuras were arrayed for battle then as for now in that battle the devas won so the devas of the thirty three bound vepacitti the lord of the asuras neck hand foot and brought him before sakka in the righteous assembly of the devas so there was vepacitti the lord of the asuras bound neck hand foot when the thought occurred to him the devas are in the right and the asuras are in the wrong i m now going over to the city of the devas then he viewed himself as freed from that fivefold bond he was fully provided with the fivefold strings of heavenly sensuality but when the thought occurred to him the asuras are in the right and the devas are in the wrong i will go over to the city of the asuras then he viewed himself as bound with that fivefold bond deprived of the

the conqueror s teaching he s ashe waneshe withershe doesn t growthus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living near savatthi at jetavana at anathapindika s monastery then he addressed the monks saying monks venerable sir said the monks by way of reply the blessed one then spoke as follows monks eleven advantages are to be expected from the release deliverance of heart by

also as something to be treasured by living in conformity with these thoughts by putting these ideas into practice and by establishing them what are the eleven he sleeps in comfort he awakes in comfort he sees no evil dreams he is dear to human beings he is dear to non human beings devas gods protect him fire poison and sword cannot touch him his mind can concentrate quickly his countenance is serene he dies without being confused in mind if he fails to attain arahantship the highest sanctity here and now he will be reborn in the brahma world these eleven advantages monks are to be expected from the release of heart by familiarizing oneself with thoughts of loving kindness by cultivation of loving kindness by constantly increasing these thoughts by regarding loving kindness as a vehicle of expression and also as something to be treasured by living in conformity with these thoughts by putting these ideas into practice and by establishing them so said the blessed one those monks rejoiced at the words of the blessed one i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery then ven nanda went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one lord as long as tath gatas worthy rightly self awakened do not appear in the world that s when the wanderers of other sects are worshipped revered honored venerated and given homage recipients of robes alms food lodgings medicinal requisites for the sick but when tath gatas worthy rightly self awakened appear in the world that s when the wanderers of other sects are not worshipped revered honored venerated or given homage nor are they recipients of robes alms food lodgings medicinal requisites for the sick now only the blessed one is worshipped revered honored venerated and given homage a recipient of robes alms food lodgings medicinal requisites for the sick along with the community of monks that s how it is nanda that s how it is as long as tath gatas worthy rightly self awakened do not appear in the world that s when the wanderers of other sects are worshipped revered honored venerated and given homage recipients of robes alms food lodgings medicinal requisites for the sick but when tath gatas worthy rightly self awakened appear in the world that s when the wanderers of other sects are not worshipped revered honored venerated or given homage nor are they recipients of robes alms food lodgings medicinal requisites for the sick now only the tath gata is worshipped revered honored venerated and given homage a recipient of robes alms food lodgings medicinal requisites for the sick along with the community of monks then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed the glowworm shines as long as the sun hasn t risen but when that splendor rises the glowworm s light is destroyed it no longer shines likewise sectarians there are these three governing principles which three the self as a governing principle the cosmos as a governing principle and the dhamma as a governing principle and what is the self as a governing principle there is the case where a monk having gone to a wilderness to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling reflects on this it is not for the sake of robes that i have gone forth from the home life into homelessness it is not for the sake of almsfood for the sake of lodgings or for the sake of this or that state of future becoming that i have gone forth from the home life into homelessness simply that i am beset by birth aging death by sorrows lamentations pains distresses despairs beset by stress overcome with stress and i hope perhaps the end of this entire mass of suffering stress might be known now if i were to seek the same sort of sensual pleasures that i abandoned in going forth from home into homelessness or a worse sort that would not be fitting for me so he reflects on this my persistence will be aroused not lax my mindfulness established not confused my body calm not aroused my mind centered unified having made himself his governing principle he abandons what is unskillful develops what is skillful abandons what is blameworthy develops what is unblameworthy and looks after himself in a pure way this is called the self as a governing principle these are the three governing principles there is in the cosmos no secret place for one who has done an evil deed your own self knows my good man whether you are true or false you underestimate the fine witness that is yourself you with evil in yourself that then you hide the devas tathagatas see the fool who goes about out of tune with the cosmos thus you should go about self governed mindful governed by the cosmos masterful absorbed in jhana governed by the dhamma acting in line with the dhamma the sage who makes an effort in truth doesn t fall back whoever through striving overpowering mara conquering the ender touches the stopping of birth is such a knower of the cosmos wise a sage unfashioned with regard to all things there are these and what is the training in heightened virtue there is the case where a monk is virtuous he dwells restrained in accordance with the patimokkha consummate in his behavior sphere of activity he trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest fault this is called the training in heightened virtue and what is the training in heightened mind there is the case where a monk quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations he enters remains in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful alert and senses pleasure with the body he enters remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress he enters remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain this is called the training in heightened mind and what is the training in heightened discernment there is the case where a monk through the ending of the mental fermentations enters remains in the fermentation free awareness release discernment release having known made them manifest for himself right in the here now this is called the training in heightened discernment these are the three trainings heightened virtue heightened mind heightened discernment persistent firm steadfast absorbed in jhana mindful with guarded faculties you should practice them as in front so behind as behind so in front as below so above as above so below as by day so by night as by night so by day conquering all the directions with limitless concentration this is called the practice of training as well as the pure way of life following it you re called self awakened in the world enlightened one who s taken the path to its end with the cessation of sensory consciousness of one released in the stopping of craving the liberation of awareness of one released in the stopping of craving is like the unbinding of a flame monks i will teach you the eight unruly horses and eight faults in horses the eight unruly men and eight faults in men listen and pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks replied the blessed one said now which are the eight unruly horses and eight faults in horses there is the case where some unruly horses when goaded ordered and told go by the charioteer back up and push the chariot back with their hindquarters some unruly horses are like this this is the first fault in a horse then again some unruly horses when goaded ordered and told go by the charioteer jump back and hit the carriage railing breaking the triple bar some unruly horses are like this this is the second fault in a horse then again some unruly horses when goaded ordered and told go by the charioteer kick the chariot pole and stomp on it some unruly horses are like this this is the third fault in a horse then again some unruly horses when goaded ordered and told go by the charioteer go off the road and make the chariot turn over some unruly horses are like this this is the fourth fault in a horse then again some unruly horses when goaded ordered and told go by the charioteer rear up and paw the air some unruly horses are like this this is the fifth fault in a horse then again some unruly horses when goaded ordered and told go by the charioteer not heeding the goad bite through the bit with their teeth and go where they will some unruly horses are like this this is the sixth fault in a horse then again some unruly horses when goaded ordered and told go by the charioteer go neither forward nor back but stand right there like a post some unruly horses are like this this is the seventh fault in a horse then again some unruly horses when goaded ordered and told go by the charioteer draw in their forefeet draw in their hindfeet and sit down right there on their four feet some unruly horses are like this this is the eighth fault in a horse these monks are the eight unruly horses and eight faults in horses and which are the eight unruly men and eight faults in men there is the case where the monks accuse a monk of an offense he being accused of an offense by the monks denies the offense saying i don t remember i don t remember he i tell you is just like the unruly horse who when goaded ordered and told go by the charioteer backs up and pushes the chariot back with its hindquarters some unruly men are like this this is the first fault in a man then again the monks accuse a monk of an offense he being accused of an offense by the monks attacks the accuser what use is there in your speaking you inexperienced fool think of yourself as worthy to be spoken to he i tell you is just like the unruly horse who when goaded ordered and told go by the charioteer jumps back and hits the carriage railing breaking the triple bar some unruly men are like this this is the second fault in a man then again the monks accuse a monk of an offense he being accused of an offense by the monks accuses the accuser in return you too have committed an offense of this name you make amends for it first he i tell you is just like the unruly horse who when goaded ordered and told go by the charioteer kicks the chariot pole and stomps on it some unruly men are like this this is the third fault in a man then again the monks accuse a monk of an offense he being accused of an offense by the monks wanders from one thing to another straying outside the topic displaying anger irritation sulkiness he i tell you is just like the unruly horse who when goaded ordered and told go by the charioteer goes off the road and makes the chariot turn over some unruly men are like this this is the fourth fault in a man then again the monks accuse a monk of an offense he being accused of an offense by the monks speaks waving his arms around in the midst of the sangha he i tell you is just like the unruly horse who when goaded ordered and told go by the charioteer rears up and paws the air some unruly men are like this this is the fifth fault in a man then again the monks accuse a monk of an offense he being accused of an offense by the monks not heeding the sangha not heeding his accuser goes off where he will still an offender he i tell you is just like the unruly horse who when goaded ordered and told go by the charioteer not heeding the goad bites through the bit with its teeth and goes where it will some unruly men are like this this is the sixth fault in a man then again the monks accuse a monk of an offense he being accused of an offense by the monks after saying i ve neither committed an offense nor have i committed an offense vexes the sangha by falling silent he i tell you is just like the unruly horse who when goaded ordered and told go by the charioteer goes neither forward nor back but stands right there like a post some unruly men are like this this is the seventh fault in a man then again the monks accuse a monk of an offense he being accused of an offense by the monks says this why do you venerable ones persecute me so much i ll disavow the training and return to the lower life on having disavowed the training and returned to the lower life he says i hope you venerable ones are gratified now he i tell you is just like the unruly horse who when goaded ordered and told go by the charioteer draws in its forefeet draws in its hind feet and sits down right there on its four feet some unruly men are like this this is the eighth fault in a man these monks are the eight unruly men and eight faults in men at savatthi then early in the morning uppalavanna the nun put on her robes and taking her bowl outer robe went into savatthi for alms when she had gone for alms in savatthi and had returned from her alms round after her meal she went to the grove of the blind to spend the day having gone deep into the grove of the blind she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day s abiding then mara the evil one wanting to arouse fear horripilation terror in her wanting to make her fall away from concentration approached her addressed her in verse you ve come nun to this sal tree with its fine flowering crest and stand alone at its root with no one to match you in beauty in your foolishness aren t you afraid of rape then the thought occurred to uppalavanna the nun now who has recited this verse a human being or a non human one then it occurred to her this is mara the evil one who has recited this verse wanting to arouse fear horripilation terror in me wanting to make me fall away from concentration then having understood that this is mara the evil one she replied to him in verses if even a hundred thousand rapists came across me like this i wouldn t stir a hair i d feel no terror and i m not afraid of then mara the evil one sad dejected at realizing uppalavanna the nun knows me vanished right there in seeing these six rewards it s enough motivation for a monk to establish the perception of stress with regard to all fabrications without exception i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion b hiya of the bark cloth was living in supp raka by the seashore he was worshipped revered honored venerated and given homage a recipient of robes alms food lodgings medicinal requisites for the sick then when he was alone in seclusion this line of thinking appeared to his awareness now of those who in this world are arahants or have entered the path of arahantship am i one then a devat who had once been a blood relative of b hiya of the bark cloth compassionate desiring his welfare knowing with her own awareness the line of thinking that had arisen in his awareness went to him and on arrival said to him you b hiya are neither an arahant nor have you entered the path of arahantship you don t even have the practice whereby you would become an arahant or enter the path of arahantship then who in this world with its devas are arahants or have entered the path to arahantship b hiya there is a city in the northern country named s vatth there the blessed one an arahant rightly self awakened is living now he truly is an arahant and teaches the dhamma leading to arahantship then b hiya deeply chastened by the devat left supp raka right then and in the space of one night the blessed one has gone into town for alms then b hiya hurriedly leaving jeta s grove and entering s vatth saw the blessed one going for alms in s vatth serene inspiring serene confidence calming his senses at peace his mind at peace having attained the utmost tranquility poise tamed guarded his senses restrained a great one when this was said the blessed one said to him this is not the time b hiya we have entered the town for alms a second time b hiya said to the blessed one but it is hard to know for sure what dangers there may be for the blessed one s life or what dangers there may be for mine teach me the dhamma o blessed one teach me the dhamma o one well gone that will be for my long term welfare bliss a second time the blessed one said to him this is not the time b hiya we have entered the town for alms a third time b hiya said to the blessed one but it is hard to know for sure what dangers there may be for the blessed one s life or what dangers there may be for mine teach me the dhamma o blessed one teach me the dhamma o one well gone that will be for my long term welfare bliss then b hiya you should train yourself thus in reference to the seen there will be only the seen in reference to the heard only the heard in reference to the sensed only the sensed in reference to the cognized only the cognized that is how you should train yourself when for you there will be only the seen in reference to the seen only the heard in reference to the heard only the sensed in reference to the sensed only the cognized in reference to the cognized then b hiya there is no you in connection with that when there is no you in connection with that there is no you there when there is no you there you are neither here nor yonder nor between the two this just this is the end of stress through hearing this brief explanation of the dhamma from the blessed one the mind of b hiya of the bark cloth right then and there was released from effluents through lack of clinging sustenance having exhorted b hiya of the bark cloth with this brief explanation of the dhamma the blessed one left now not long after the blessed one s departure b hiya was attacked killed by a cow with a young calf then the blessed one having gone for alms in s vatth after the meal returning from his alms round with a large number of monks saw that b hiya had died on seeing him he said to the monks take b hiya s body monks and placing it on a litter and carrying it away cremate it and build him a memorial your companion in the holy life has died responding as you say lord to the blessed one the monks placing b hiya s body on a litter carrying it away cremating it and building him a memorial went to the blessed one on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they said to him b hiya s body has been cremated lord and his memorial has been built what is his destination what is his future state monks b hiya of the bark cloth was wise he practiced the dhamma in accordance with the dhamma and did not pester me with issues related to the dhamma b hiya of the bark cloth monks is totally unbound then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed where water earth fire wind have no footing there the stars don t shine the sun isn t visible there the moon doesn t appear there darkness is not found and when a sage a brahman through sagacity has realized this for himself then from form formless from bliss pain he is freed then a certain monk went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one the world the world insofar as it disintegrates the ear disintegrates sounds disintegrate the nose disintegrates aromas disintegrate the tongue disintegrates tastes disintegrate the body disintegrates tactile sensations disintegrate the intellect disintegrates ideas disintegrate consciousness at the intellect consciousness disintegrates contact at the intellect disintegrates and whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect experienced as pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain that too disintegrates insofar as it disintegrates it is called the world monks for one who partakes of sensuality poverty is suffering in the world yes lord and a poor destitute penniless person gets into debt for one who partakes of sensuality getting into debt is suffering in the world yes lord and a poor destitute penniless person having gotten into debt owes interest payments for one who partakes of sensuality interest payment is suffering in the world yes lord and when a poor destitute penniless person owing interest payments does not pay interest on time they serve him notice for one who partakes of sensuality being served notice is suffering in the world yes lord and when a poor destitute penniless person being served notice does not pay they hound him for one who partakes of sensuality being hounded is suffering in the world yes lord and when a poor destitute penniless person being hounded does not pay he is put into bondage for one who partakes of sensuality bondage is suffering in the world yes lord thus monks poverty is suffering in the world for one who partakes of sensuality getting into debt is suffering in the world for one who partakes of sensuality interest payment is suffering in the world for one who partakes of sensuality being served notice is suffering in the world for one who partakes of sensuality being hounded is suffering in the world for one who partakes of sensuality bondage is suffering in the world for one who partakes of sensuality in the same way monks whoever has no conviction with regard to skillful mental qualities no sense of conscience with regard to skillful mental qualities no sense of concern with regard to skillful mental qualities no persistence with regard to skillful mental qualities no discernment with regard to skillful mental qualities is in the discipline of a noble one said to be poor destitute penniless he poor destitute penniless having no conviction with regard to skillful mental qualities no sense of conscience no sense of concern no persistence no discernment with regard to skillful mental qualities engages in misconduct by way of the body misconduct by way of speech misconduct by way of the mind for him i tell you this is getting into debt for the purpose of concealing his bodily misconduct he formulates evil desires he desires may they not know about me he resolves may they not know about me he speaks thinking may they not know about me he makes an effort with his body thinking may they not know about me for the purpose of concealing his verbal misconduct for the purpose of concealing his mental misconduct he formulates evil desires he desires may they not know about me he resolves may they not know about me he speaks thinking may they not know about me he makes an effort with his body thinking may they not know about me for him i tell you this is interest payment and then his well behaved companions in the holy life say about him this venerable one acts in this way behaves in this way for him i tell you this is being served notice and then when he has gone to the wilderness to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling he is beset with evil unskillful thoughts accompanied by remorse for him i tell you this is being hounded he poor destitute penniless having engaged in misconduct by way of the body misconduct by way of speech misconduct by way of the mind on the break up of the body after death is bound by the bond of hell or the bond of the animal womb and i can imagine no one other bond so tormenting so painful so obstructive to the unexcelled rest from bondage as the bond of hell or the bond of the animal womb poverty is called suffering in the world so too is getting into debt a poor person in debt partaking of sensuality suffers hardship then they hound him and put him into bondage the painful bond for one longing to gain sensual pleasures now anyone with no conviction in the discipline of a noble one no sense of conscience no sense of concern contemplating evil actions doing wrong by way of body wrong by way of speech wrong by way of the mind wants may they not know about me he creeps along in body speech or mind piling up evil actions here there again again he with evil actions his wisdom weak knowing his own wrong doing is a poor person in debt partaking of sensuality he suffers hardship then they hound him painful mental resolves born of remorse at home or in the wilderness he with evil actions his wisdom weak knowing his own wrong doing goes to an animal womb or is bound in hell the painful bond from which the enlightened are freed but one with confidence living at home making gifts of his belongings righteously gained wins both goals advantage in the here now happiness in the world beyond the liberality of this householder piles up merit now anyone with conviction firmly established in the discipline of a noble one with a sense of conscience a sense of concern discerning restrained by virtue is in the discipline of a noble one said to be living in ease gaining a pleasure not of the flesh he determines on equanimity abandoning the five hindrances persistence constantly aroused entering the jhanas unified mindful wise knowing this as it actually is in the total ending of all fetters through everywhere not clinging his mind is rightly released in him such rightly released there is the knowledge in the total ending of the fetters of becoming my release is unshakable that is the highest knowledge that the happiness unexcelled sorrowless dustless at rest that is release from debt then ven ananda went to ven sariputta and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to ven sariputta friend sariputta to what extent does a monk hear dhamma that he has not heard do the dhammas he has heard not get confused do the dhammas he has touched with his awareness stay current and does he understand what previously was not understood friend ananda is learned let the answer occur to him in that case friend sariputta listen to the dhamma pay careful attention i will speak as you say friend ven sariputta responded ven ananda said there is the case friend where a monk masters the dhamma dialogues narratives of mixed prose verse explanations verses spontaneous exclamations quotations birth stories amazing events question answer sessions he teaches the dhamma in detail as he has heard it as he has remembered it to others he gets others to recite the dhamma in detail as they have heard it as they have remembered it he holds a group chanting of the dhamma in detail as he has heard it as he has remembered it he thinks about evaluates the dhamma as he has heard it as he has remembered it he contemplates it with his intellect he enters the rains in monasteries in which there are senior monks who are learned who know the tradition who are holders of the dhamma the vinaya the matika it s to this extent friend sariputta that a monk hears dhamma he has not heard that the dhammas he has heard do not get confused that the dhammas he has touched with his awareness stay current and that he understands what previously was not understood it s amazing my friend it s astounding my friend how well said that was by friend ananda and we will remember friend ananda as endowed with these six qualities friend ananda has mastered the dhamma dialogues narratives of mixed prose and verse explanations verses spontaneous exclamations quotations birth stories amazing events question answer sessions friend ananda teaches the dhamma in detail as he has heard it as he has remembered it to others friend ananda gets others to recite the dhamma in detail as they have heard it as they have remembered it friend ananda holds a group chanting of the dhamma in detail as he has heard it as he has remembered it friend ananda thinks about evaluates the dhamma as he has heard it as he has remembered it he contemplates it with his intellect friend ananda enters the rains in monasteries in which there are senior monks who are learned who know the tradition who are holders of the dhamma the vinaya the matika having approached them periodically he questions them quizzes them how it this venerable sirs what is the meaning of this they make open for friend ananda what wasn t open make plain what wasn t plain dispel doubt on various doubtful points contents even if a man does not will and plan yet if he dwells on something this forms a basis for the continuation of consciousness rebirth takes place but if a man neither wills nor plans nor dwells on anything no basis is formed for the continuation of consciousness this basis being absent consciousness has no lodgment consciousness not being lodged there and not growing no rebirth of renewed existence takes place in the future and so birth decay and death grief lamentation suffering sorrow and despair are destroyed such is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at uruvel on the bank of the nera jar river at the root of the bodhi tree the tree of awakening newly awakened and on that occasion he sat at the root of the bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of release at the end of seven days he emerged from that concentration then a certain overbearing brahman went to the blessed one and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he stood to one side as he was standing there he said to the blessed one to what extent master gotama is one a brahman and which are the qualities that make one a brahman then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed any brahman who has banished evil qualities i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion a certain monk was sitting not far from the blessed one his legs crossed his body held erect enduring fierce pains sharp severe that were the result of old kamma mindful alert without suffering the blessed one saw him sitting not far away his legs crossed his body held erect enduring fierce pains sharp severe that were the result of old kamma mindful alert and not struck down by them then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed for the monk who has left all kamma behind shaking off the dust of the past steady unpossessive such see how the world together with the devas has self conceit for what is not self enclosed by mind and body it imagines this is real whatever they imagine it to be it is quite different from that it is unreal of a false nature and perishable nibbana not false in nature that the noble ones forms sounds tastes scents bodily contacts and ideas which are agreeable pleasant and charming all these while they last are deemed to be happiness by the world with its devas but when they cease that is agreed by all to be unsatisfactory by the noble ones the cessation of the existing body what others call happiness that the noble ones declare to be suffering what others call suffering that the noble ones have found to be happiness see how difficult it is to understand the dhamma herein those without insight have completely gone astray for those under the veil of ignorance it is obscured for those who cannot see it is utter darkness but for the good and the wise it is as obvious as the light for those who can see even though close to it the witless who do not know the dhamma do not comprehend it by those overcome by attachment to existence those who drift with the stream of existence those in the realm of thus have i heard at one time the lord was staying near i ask gotama this dhamma subtle and pleasing and taught so clearly by you lord it is this we all wish to hear having been questioned foremost awakened one tell us the answer all these bhikkhus and also the layfollowers who have come to hear the truth let them listen to the dhamma awakened to anubuddham by the stainless one as the devas listen to the well spoken words of the lord listen to me bhikkhus i will teach you the ascetic practice dhamma dhutam the mode of living suitable for those who have gone forth do you all bear it in mind one who is intent upon what is good and who is thoughtful should practice it a bhikkhu should not wander about at the wrong time but should walk the village for food at the right time as one who goes about at the wrong time is liable to be obsessed by attachment therefore awakened ones do not walk for alms at the wrong time if he should speak with a lay disciple with someone else or with another bhikkhu he should speak on the subtle dhamma not slandering others nor gossiping some set themselves up as disputants in opposition to others those of little wisdom we do not praise attachments bind them and they are carried away by their emotions having heard the dhamma taught by the sugata now i will tell you the he should not kill a living being nor cause it to be killed nor should he incite another to kill do not injure any being either strong or weak in the world a disciple should avoid taking anything from anywhere knowing it to belong to another he should not steal nor incite another to steal he should completely avoid theft a wise man should avoid unchastity as he would avoid falling into a pit of glowing charcoal if unable to lead a celibate life he should not go to another s wife having entered a royal court or a company of people he should not speak lies he should not speak lies himself nor incite others to do so he should completely avoid falsehood a layman who has chosen to practice this dhamma should not indulge in the drinking of intoxicants he should not drink them nor encourage others to do so realizing that it leads to madness through intoxication foolish people perform evil deeds and cause other heedless people to do likewise he should avoid intoxication this occasion for demerit which stupefies the mind and is the pleasure of foolish people do not kill a living being do not take what is not given do not speak a lie do not drink intoxicants abstain from sexual intercourse do not eat food at night at the wrong time do not wear flower garlands nor use perfumes use the ground as a bed or sleep on a mat this is called the eight factored observance made known by the awakened one who has reached the end of suffering with a gladdened mind observe the observance day uposatha complete with its eight factors on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth days of the lunar fortnight and also the special holiday of the half month in the morning with a pure heart and a joyful mind a wise man after observing the uposatha should distribute suitable food and drink to the community of bhikkhus he should support his mother and father as his duty and engage in lawful trading a layman who carries this out diligently goes to the devas called self radiant i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in exactly so friends i understand the dhamma taught by the blessed one such that it is just this consciousness that runs and wanders on not another then those monks desiring to pry the monk s ti the fisherman s son away from that pernicious viewpoint quizzed him back forth and rebuked him saying don t say that friend s ti don t slander the blessed one for it is not good to slander the blessed one the blessed one would not say anything like that in many ways friend the blessed one has said of dependently co arisen consciousness apart from a requisite condition there is no coming into play of consciousness and yet even though he was quizzed back forth and rebuked by those monks the monk s ti the fisherman s son through stubbornness and attachment to that very same pernicious viewpoint continued to insist exactly so friends i understand the dhamma taught by the blessed one such that it is just this consciousness that runs and wanders on not another so when the monks were unable to pry the monk s ti the fisherman s son away from that pernicious viewpoint they went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they told him what had happened so the blessed one told a certain monk come monk in my name call the monk s ti the fisherman s son saying the teacher calls you friend s ti as you say lord the monk answered and having gone to the monk s ti the fisherman s son on arrival he said the teacher calls you friend s ti as you say friend the monk s ti the fisherman s son replied then he went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him is it true s ti that this pernicious view has arisen in you as i understand the dhamma taught by the blessed one it is just this consciousness that runs and wanders on not another exactly so lord as i understand the dhamma taught by the blessed one it is just this consciousness that runs and wanders on not another which consciousness s ti is that this speaker this knower lord that is sensitive here there to the ripening of good evil actions and to whom worthless man do you understand me to have taught the dhamma like that haven t i in many ways said of dependently co arisen consciousness apart from a requisite condition there is no coming into play of consciousness then the blessed one said to the monks what do you think monks is this monk s ti the fisherman s son even warm in this dhamma vinaya how could he be lord no lord when this was said the monk s ti the fisherman s son sat silent abashed his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for words then the blessed one seeing that the monk s ti the fisherman s son was sitting silent abashed his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for words said to him worthless man you will be recognized for your own pernicious viewpoint i will cross question the monks on this matter then the blessed one addressed the monks monks do you too understand the dhamma as taught by me in the same way that the monk s ti the fisherman s son does when through his own poor grasp of the dhamma he not only slanders us but also digs himself up by the root and produces much demerit for himself no lord for in many ways the blessed one has said of dependently co arisen consciousness apart from a requisite condition there is no coming into play of consciousness it s good monks that you understand the dhamma taught by me in this way for in many ways i have said of dependently co arisen consciousness apart from a requisite condition there is no coming into play of consciousness but this monk s ti the fisherman s son through his own poor grasp of the dhamma has not only slandered us but has also dug himself up by the root producing much demerit for himself that will lead to this worthless man s long term harm suffering consciousness classified by requisite condition consciousness monks is classified simply by the requisite condition in dependence on which it arises consciousness that arises in dependence on the eye forms is classified simply as eye consciousness consciousness that arises in dependence on the ear sounds is classified simply as ear consciousness consciousness that arises in dependence on the nose aromas is classified simply as nose consciousness consciousness that arises in dependence on the tongue flavors is classified simply as tongue consciousness consciousness that arises in dependence on the body tactile sensations is classified simply as body consciousness consciousness that arises in dependence on the intellect ideas is classified simply as intellect consciousness on becoming monks do you see this has come to be yes lord monks do you see it comes into play from that nutriment yes lord monks do you see from the cessation of that nutriment what has come to be is

were to not to cherish it not to treasure it not to regard it as mine would you understand the dhamma taught as analogous to a raft for crossing over not for holding on to yes lord nutriment dependent co arising monks there are these four nutriments for the maintenance of beings who have come into being or for the support of those in search of a place to be born which four physical food gross or refined contact as the second intellectual intention the third and consciousness the fourth now these four nutriments have what as their cause what as their origination through what are they born through what are they brought into being these four nutriments have craving as their cause craving as their origination are born from craving are brought into being from craving and this craving has what as its cause what as its origination through what is it born through what is it brought into being craving has feeling as its cause is brought into being through feeling and this feeling has what as its cause through what is it brought into being feeling has contact as its cause and this contact has what as its cause through what is it brought into being contact has the six sense media as its cause and these six sense media have what as their cause through what are they brought into being the six sense media have name form as their cause and this name form has what as its cause through what is it brought into being name form has consciousness as its cause and this consciousness has what as its cause through what is it brought into being consciousness has fabrications as its cause and these fabrications have what as their cause through what are they brought into being fabrications have ignorance as their cause ignorance as their origination are born from ignorance are brought into being from ignorance the arising of stress suffering thus from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications from birth as a requisite condition comes aging death thus was it said now monks is it the case that from birth as a requisite condition comes aging death or not or how is it here lord from birth as a requisite condition comes aging death that s how it is for us here from birth as a requisite condition comes aging death similarly with the remaining requisite conditions down to from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications thus was it said now monks is it the case that from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications or not or how is it here lord from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications that s how it is for us here from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications it s good monks that you say that and i say that when this is that is from the arising of this comes the arising of that in other words from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications the cessation of stress suffering now from the remainderless fading and cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications from

no lord knowing thus and seeing thus would you be inwardly perplexed about the immediate present thinking no lord knowing thus and seeing thus would you say the teacher is our respected mentor we speak thus out of respect for the teacher no lord knowing thus and seeing thus would you say the contemplative says this we speak thus in line with the contemplative s words no lord knowing thus and seeing thus would you dedicate yourselves to another teacher no lord knowing thus and seeing thus would you return to the observances grand ceremonies auspicious rites of common contemplatives brahmans as having any essence no lord is it the case that you speak simply in line with what you have known seen understood for yourselves yes lord good monks you have been guided by me in this dhamma which is to be seen here now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the observant for themselves for it has been said this dhamma is to be seen here now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be by the observant for themselves and it was in reference to this that it was said the birth growth of a being monks the descent of the embryo occurs with the union of three things there is the case where there is no union of the mother father the mother is not in her season and a gandhabba then for nine or ten months the mother shelters the embryo in her womb with great anxiety as a heavy burden then at the end of nine or ten months she gives birth with great anxiety as a heavy burden then when the child is born she feeds it with her own blood for mother s milk is called blood in the discipline of the noble ones then as the child grows and his faculties mature he plays at children s as he grows and his faculties mature still further he enjoys himself provided endowed with the five strings of sensuality forms cognizable via the eye agreeable pleasing charming endearing enticing accompanied with sensual desire sounds cognizable via the ear aromas cognizable via the nose flavors cognizable via the tongue tactile sensations cognizable via the body agreeable pleasing charming endearing enticing accompanied with sensual desire limited awareness on seeing a form with the eye he is infatuated with pleasing forms and gets upset over unpleasing forms he dwells with body mindfulness unestablished on hearing a sound with the ear on smelling an aroma with the

it remains fastened to it delight arises now any delight in feeling is clinging sustenance from his clinging sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth from birth as a requisite condition then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair come into play such is the origination of this entire mass of stress suffering the path to unlimited awareness now there is the case where a tath gata appears in the world worthy and rightly self awakened he teaches the dhamma admirable in its beginning admirable in its middle admirable in its end he proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure he the person discussed above hearing the dhamma gains conviction in the tath gata and reflects household life is confining a dusty path life gone forth is the open air it isn t easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shell what if i having shaved off my hair beard and putting on the ochre robe were to go forth from the household life into homelessness so after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of

his bowl when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and remaining silent he makes himself alert abandoning the hindrances endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue this noble restraint over the sense faculties this noble mindfulness alertness he seeks out a secluded dwelling a wilderness the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a forest grove the open air a heap of straw after his meal returning from his alms round he sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and

becoming from the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth from the cessation of birth then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair all cease such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress suffering monks remember this my brief account of release through the destruction of craving and s ti the fisherman s son as tied up in the great net of craving the great tangle of craving that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion the dear and beloved only son of a certain lay follower had died so a large number of lay followers their clothes wet their hair wet went to the blessed one in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there the blessed one said to them why have you come here your clothes wet your hair wet in the middle of the day when this was said the lay follower said to the blessed one my dear and beloved only son lord has died this is why we have come here our clothes wet our hair wet in the middle of the day then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed tied down by the allure of what seems dear see also monks these four types of individuals are to be found existing in the world which four the one who practices for his her own benefit but not for that of others the one who practices for the benefit of others but not for his her own the one who practices neither for his her own benefit nor for that of others the one who practices for his her own benefit and for that of others and who is the individual who practices for his her own benefit but not for that of others there is the case where a certain individual practices for the subduing of passion within him herself but doesn t encourage others in the subduing of passion practices for the subduing of aversion within him herself but doesn t encourage others in the subduing of aversion practices for the subduing of delusion within him herself but doesn t encourage others in the subduing of delusion such is the individual who practices for his her own benefit but not for that of others and who is the individual who practices for the benefit of others but not for his her own there is the case where a certain individual doesn t practice for the subduing of passion within him herself but encourages others in the subduing of passion he she doesn t practice for the subduing of aversion within him herself but encourages others in the subduing of aversion he she doesn t practice for the subduing of delusion within him herself but encourages others in the subduing of delusion such is the individual who practices for the benefit of others but not for his her own and who is the individual who practices neither for his her own benefit nor for that of others there is the case where a certain individual doesn t practice for the subduing of passion within him herself and doesn t encourage others in the subduing of passion he she doesn t practice for the subduing of aversion within him herself and doesn t encourage others in the subduing of aversion he she doesn t practice for the subduing of delusion within him herself and doesn t encourage others in the subduing of delusion such is the individual who practices neither for his her own benefit nor for that of others and who is the individual who practices for his her own benefit and for that of others there is the case where a certain individual practices for the subduing of passion within him herself and encourages others in the subduing of passion practices for the subduing of aversion within him herself and encourages others in the subduing of aversion practices for the subduing of delusion within him herself and encourages others in the subduing of delusion such is the individual who practices for his her own benefit and for that of others these are the four types of individuals to be found existing in the world on one occasion with sensual lust i burn my mind is on fire please gotama from compassion tell me how to put it out ven ananda develop thei have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near yes ananda there is one quality that when developed pursued brings four qualities to completion and four qualities that when developed pursued bring seven qualities to completion and seven qualities that when developed pursued bring two qualities to completion and what is the one quality that when developed pursued brings four qualities to completion what are the four qualities that when developed pursued bring seven qualities to completion what are the seven qualities that when developed pursued bring two qualities to completion mindfulness of in out breathing when developed pursued brings the four frames of referencemindfulness of in out breathing now how is mindfulness of in out breathing developed pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination there is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore always mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out the four frames of reference this is how mindfulness of in out breathing is developed pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination the seven factors for awakening and how are the four frames of reference developed pursued so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination this is how the four frames of reference are developed pursued so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination clear knowing release and how are the seven factors for awakening developed pursued so as to bring clear knowing release to their culmination there is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in relinquishment he develops analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening persistence as a factor for awakening rapture as a factor for awakening serenity as a factor for awakening concentration as a factor for awakening equanimity as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in relinquishment this is how the seven factors for awakening when developed pursued bring clear knowing release to their culmination that is what the blessed one said gratified ven ananda delighted in the blessed one s words thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living near savatthi at jetavana at the monastery of anathapindika then the blessed one addressed the monks saying monks venerable sir they said by way of reply the blessed one then spoke as follows these ten essentials i am now changed into a different mode of life from that of a layman this must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forth my life depends on others this must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forth i must now behave in a different manner this must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forth does my mind upbraid me regarding the state of my virtue do my discerning fellow monks having tested me reproach me regarding the state of my virtue this must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forth there will be a parting some day from all those who are dear and loving to me death brings this separation to me this must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forth of how do i spend my nights and days this must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forth do i take delight in solitude this must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forth have i gained superhuman faculties have i gained that higher wisdom so that when i am questioned on this point by fellow monks at the last moment when death is approaching i will have no occasion to be depressed and downcast this must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forth these monks are the essentials that should be reflected again and again by one who has gone forth to live the holy life so spoke the blessed one those monks rejoiced at the words of the blessed one i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the c likans at c lik mountain and on that occasion ven meghiya was his attendant then ven meghiya went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him stood to one side as he was standing there he said to the blessed one i would like to go into jantu village for alms then do meghiya what you think it is now time to do then in the early morning ven meghiya adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl robes went into jantu village for alms having gone for alms in jantu village after the meal returning from his alms round he went to the bank of the kimik l river as he was walking up down along the bank of the river to exercise his legs he saw a pleasing charming mango grove seeing it the thought occurred to him how pleasing charming this mango grove it s enough for a young man of good family intent on exertion to exert himself in meditation if the blessed one gives me permission i would like to exert myself in meditation in this mango grove so ven meghiya went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one just now in the early morning i adjusted my under robe and carrying my bowl robes went into jantu village for alms having gone for alms in jantu village after the meal returning from my alms round i went to the bank of the kimik l river as i was walking up down along the bank of the river to exercise my legs i saw a pleasing charming mango grove seeing it the thought occurred to me how pleasing charming this mango grove it s enough for a young man of good family intent on exertion to exert himself in meditation if the blessed one gives me permission i would like to exert myself in meditation in this mango grove if the blessed one gives me permission i would like to go to the mango grove to exert myself in meditation when this was said the blessed one responded to ven meghiya as long as i am still alone stay here until another monk comes a second time ven meghiya said to the blessed one lord the blessed one has nothing further to do and nothing further to add to what he has done i however have something further to do and something further to add to what i have done if the blessed one gives me permission i would like to go to the mango grove to exert myself in meditation a second time the blessed one responded to ven meghiya as long as i am still alone stay here until another monk comes a third time ven meghiya said to the blessed one lord the blessed one has nothing further to do and nothing further to add to what he has done i however have something further to do and something further to add to what i have done if the blessed one gives me permission i would like to go to the mango grove to exert myself in meditation as you are talking about exertion meghiya what can we say do what you think it is now time to do then ven meghiya rising from his seat bowing down to the blessed one and circling him to the right went to the mango grove on arrival having gone deep into the grove he sat down at the root of a certain tree for the day s abiding now while ven meghiya was staying in the mango grove he was for the most part assailed by three kinds of unskillful thoughts thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will and thoughts of doing harm the thought occurred to him how amazing how astounding even though it was through faith that i went forth from home to the homeless life still i am overpowered by these three kinds of unskillful thoughts thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will and thoughts of doing harm emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon he went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one just now while i was staying in the mango grove i was for the most part assailed by three kinds of unskillful thoughts thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will and thoughts of doing harm the thought occurred to me how amazing how astounding even though it was through faith that i went forth from home to the homeless life still i am overpowered by these three kinds of unskillful thoughts thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will and thoughts of doing harm meghiya in one whose awareness release is still immature five qualities bring it to maturity which five there is the case where a monk has admirable people as friends companions colleagues in one whose awareness release is still immature this is the first quality that brings it to maturity furthermore the monk is virtuous he dwells restrained in accordance with the p imokkha consummate in his behavior range of activity he trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faults in one whose awareness release is still immature this is the second quality that brings it to maturity furthermore he gets to hear at will easily and without difficulty talk that is truly sobering and conducive to the opening of awareness i e talk on modesty contentment seclusion non entanglement arousing persistence virtue concentration discernment release and the knowledge vision of release in one whose awareness release is still immature this is the third quality that brings it to maturity furthermore he keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and for taking on skillful qualities he is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualities in one whose awareness release is still immature this is the fourth quality that brings it to maturity furthermore he is discerning endowed with the discernment related to arising passing away noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress in one whose awareness release is still immature this is the fifth quality that brings it to maturity meghiya in one whose awareness release is still immature these are the five qualities that bring it to maturity meghiya when a monk has admirable people as friends companions colleagues it is to be expected that he will be virtuous will dwell restrained in accordance with the p imokkha consummate in his behavior range of activity and will train himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faults when a monk has admirable people as friends colleagues it is to be expected that he will get to hear at will easily and without difficulty talk that is truly sobering and conducive to the opening of awareness i e talk on modesty contentment seclusion non entanglement arousing persistence virtue concentration discernment release and the knowledge vision of release when a monk has admirable people as friends companions colleagues it is to be expected that he will keep his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful qualities and for taking on skillful qualities steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualities when a monk has admirable people as friends companions colleagues it is to be expected that he will be discerning endowed with the discernment relating to arising passing away noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress and furthermore when the monk is established in these five qualities there are four additional qualities he should develop he should develop contemplation of the unattractive so as to abandon passion he should develop good will so as to abandon ill will he should develop mindfulness of in out breathing so as to cut off thinking he should develop the perception of inconstancy so as to uproot the conceit i am then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed little thoughts subtle thoughts when followed stir up the heart not comprehending the thoughts of the heart one runs here there the mind out of control but comprehending the thoughts of the heart one who is ardent mindful restrains them when followed they stir up the heart one awakened lets them go without trace see also ornamented finely clothed garlanded adorned her feet stained red with lac she wore slippers a courtesan stepping out of her slippers her hands raised before me palm to palm over her heart she softly tenderly in measured words spoke to me first you are young recluse heed my message partake of human sensuality i will give you luxury truly i vow to you i will tend to you as to a fire when we are old both leaning on canes then we will both become contemplatives winning the benefits of both worlds and seeing her before me a courtesan ornamented finely clothed hands palm to palm over her heart like a snare of death laid out apt attention arose in me the drawbacks appeared disenchantment stood at an even keel with that my heart was released see the dhamma s true rightness the three knowledges have been attained the buddha s bidding done i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near now these four nutriments have what as their cause what as their origination what as their source what as that which brings them into play these four nutriments have craving as their cause craving as their origination craving as their source craving as that which brings them into play and this craving has what as its cause what as its origination what as its source what as that which brings it into play feeling and this feeling has what as its cause contact and this contact has what as its cause the six sense media and these six sense media have what as their cause name form and this name form has what as its cause consciousness and this consciousness has what as its cause fabrication and this fabrication has what as its cause what as its origination what as its source what as that which brings it into play fabrication has ignorance

requisite condition comes contact from contact as a requisite condition comes feeling from feeling as a requisite condition comes craving from craving as a requisite condition comes clinging sustenance from clinging sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth from birth as a requisite condition then aging death sorrow lamentation

becoming comes the cessation of birth from the cessation of birth then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair all cease such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress suffering i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion there were many contemplatives brahmans wanderers of various sects living around s vatth with differing views differing opinions differing beliefs dependent for support on their differing views some of the contemplatives brahmans held this doctrine this view the cosmos is eternal only this is true anything otherwise is worthless some of the contemplatives brahmans held this doctrine this view the cosmos is not eternal the cosmos is finite the cosmos is infinite the soul is the same thing as the body the soul is one thing and the body another after death a tath gata exists after death a tath gata does not exist after death a tath gata both exists does not exist after death a tath gata neither exists nor does not exist only this is true anything otherwise is worthless and they kept on arguing quarreling disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying the dhamma is like this it s not like that the dhamma s not like that it s like this then in the early morning a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and carrying their bowls robes went into s vatth for alms having gone for alms in s vatth after the meal returning from their alms round they went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they said to the blessed one lord there are many contemplatives brahmans wanderers of various sects living around s vatth with differing views differing opinions differing beliefs dependent for support on their differing views and they keep on arguing quarreling disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying the dhamma is like this it s not like that the dhamma s not like that it s like this monks the wanderers of other sects are blind eyeless they don t know what is beneficial and what is harmful they don t know what is the dhamma and what is non dhamma not knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful not knowing what is dhamma and what is non dhamma they keep on arguing quarreling disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying the dhamma is like this it s not like that the dhamma s not like that it s like this once monks in this same s vatth there was a certain king and the king said to a certain man come my good man gather together all the people in s vatth who have been blind from birth responding as you say your majesty to the king the man having rounded up all the people in s vatth who had been blind from birth went to the king and on arrival said your majesty the people in s vatth who have been blind from birth have been gathered together very well then i say show the blind people an elephant responding as you say your majesty to the king the man showed the blind people an elephant to some of the blind people he showed the elephant s head saying this blind people is what an elephant is like to some of them he showed the elephant s ear saying this blind people is what an elephant is like to some of them he showed the elephant s tusk the elephant s trunk the elephant s body the elephant s foot the elephant s hindquarters the elephant s tail the tuft at the end of the elephant s tail saying this blind people is what an elephant is like then having shown the blind people the elephant the man went to the king and on arrival said your majesty the blind people have seen the elephant may your majesty do what you think it is now time to do then the king went to the blind people and on arrival asked them blind people have you seen the elephant yes your majesty we have seen the elephant now tell me blind people what the elephant is like the blind people who had been shown the elephant s head said the elephant your majesty is just like a jar those who had been shown the elephant s ear said the elephant your majesty is just like a winnowing basket those who

harmful they don t know what is the dhamma and what is non dhamma not knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful not knowing what is dhamma and what is non dhamma they keep on arguing quarreling disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying the dhamma is like this it s not like that the dhamma s not like that it s like this then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed with regard to these things they re attached some contemplatives brahmans they quarrel fight people seeing one side monks there are these four modes of practice which four painful practice with slow intuition painful practice with quick intuition pleasant practice with slow intuition pleasant practice with quick intuition and which is painful practice with slow intuition there is the case where a monk remains focused on unattractiveness with regard to the body percipient of loathsomeness with regard to food percipient of non delight with regard to the entire world and focused on inconstancy with regard to all fabrications the perception of death is well established within him he dwells in dependence on the five strengths of a learner strength of conviction strength of conscience strength of concern strength of persistence strength of discernment but these five faculties of his the faculty of conviction the faculty of persistence the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of discernment appear weakly because of their weakness he attains only slowly the immediacy and which is painful practice with quick intuition

called pleasant practice with quick intuition these are the four modes of practice i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion ven revata the doubter was sitting not far from the blessed one his legs crossed his body held erect reflecting on his purification through the overcoming of doubt the blessed one saw ven revata the doubter sitting not far away his legs crossed his body held erect reflecting on his purification through the overcoming of doubt then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed any doubts about here or the world beyond about what is experienced by because of others by because of oneself i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery at that time ven s riputta was with a variety of approaches instructing urging rousing encouraging ven bhaddiya the dwarf with dhamma talk to an even greater extent as he thought that bhaddiya was still just a learner the blessed one saw that ven s riputta was with a variety of approaches instructing urging rousing encouraging ven bhaddiya the dwarf with dhamma talk to an even greater extent as he thought that bhaddiya was still just a learner then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed he has cut the cycle has gone away to freedom from longing the dried up stream no longer flows the cycle cut no longer turns this just this is the end of stress there are these five inhabitants of the states of deprivation inhabitants of hell who are in agony incurable which five one who has killed his her mother one who has killed his her father one who has killed an arahant one who with a corrupted mind has caused the blood of a tathagata to flow and one who has caused a split in the sangha these are the five inhabitants of the states of deprivation inhabitants of hell who are in agony incurable knowing this as a true distinction the enlightened constantlythose with initiative alternate translation this was said by the lord bhikkhus these two bright principles protect the world what are the two shame and fear of wrongdoing if bhikkhus these two bright principles did not protect the world there would not be discerned respect for mother or maternal aunt or maternal uncle s wife or a teacher s wife or the wives of other honored persons and the world would have fallen into promiscuity as with goats sheep chickens pigs dogs and jackals but as these two bright principles protect the world there is discerned respect for mother and the wives of other honored persons those in whom shame and fear of wrong are not consistently found have deviated from the bright root and are led back to birth and death but those in whom shame and fear of wrong are consistently ever present peaceful mature in the holy life they put an end to renewal of being i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying in yes lord the monks replied the blessed one said monks speech endowed with four characteristics is well spoken not poorly spoken faultless not to be faulted by the wise which four there is the case where a monk says only what it well spoken not what is poorly spoken only what is just not what is unjust only what is endearing not what is unendearing only what is true not what is false speech endowed with these four characteristics is well spoken not poorly spoken faultless not to be faulted by the wise that is what the blessed one said having said this the one well gone the teacher said further the calm say that what is well spoken is best second that one should say what is just not unjust third what s endearing not unendearing fourth what is true not false then let the inspiration come to you vangisa the blessed one said then ven vangisa praised the blessed one to his face with these attractive verses speak only the speech that neither torments self nor does harm to others that speech is truly well spoken speak only endearing speech speech that is welcomed speech when it brings no evil to others is pleasant truth indeed is deathless speech this is an ancient principle the goal and the dhamma so say the calm are firmly established on truth the speech the awakened one speaks for attaining unbinding rest for making an end to the mass of stress that is the speech unexcelled then king milinda approached the venerable nagasena greeted him and sat down at a respectful distance king milinda anxious to know anxious to hear anxious to remember anxious

must generate the desire to hear it is difficult for others revered nagasena to point to the power of the buddha by inference through reasons such as these i am satisfied revered nagasena by your extremely variegated exposition of the question i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at yes lord the monks replied the blessed one said monks before my self awakening when i was still just an unawakened bodhisatta the thought occurred to me why don t i keep dividing my thinking into two sorts so i made thinking imbued with sensuality thinking imbued with ill will thinking imbued with harmfulness one sort and thinking imbued with renunciation thinking imbued with non ill will thinking imbued with harmlessness another sort and as i remained thus heedful ardent resolute thinking imbued with sensuality arose in me i discerned that thinking imbued with sensuality has arisen in me and that leads to my own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of both it obstructs discernment promotes vexation does not lead to unbinding as i noticed that it leads to my own affliction it subsided as i noticed that it leads to the affliction of others to the affliction of both it obstructs discernment promotes vexation does not lead to unbinding it subsided whenever thinking imbued with sensuality had arisen i simply abandoned it dispelled it wiped it out of existence and as i remained thus heedful ardent resolute thinking imbued with ill will arose in me i discerned that thinking imbued with ill will has arisen in me and that leads to my own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of both it obstructs discernment promotes vexation does not lead to unbinding as i noticed that it leads to my own affliction it subsided as i noticed that it leads to the affliction of others to the affliction of both it obstructs discernment promotes vexation does not lead to unbinding it subsided whenever thinking imbued with ill will had arisen i simply abandoned it dispelled it wiped it out of existence and as i remained thus heedful ardent resolute thinking imbued with harmfulness arose in me i discerned that thinking imbued with harmfulness has arisen in me and that leads to my own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of both it obstructs discernment promotes vexation does not lead to unbinding as i noticed that it leads to my own affliction it subsided as i noticed that it leads to the affliction of others to the affliction of both it obstructs discernment promotes vexation does not lead to unbinding it subsided whenever thinking imbued with harmfulness had arisen i simply abandoned it dispelled it wiped it out of existence and as i remained thus heedful ardent resolute thinking imbued with renunciation arose in me i discerned that thinking imbued with renunciation has arisen in me and that leads neither to my own affliction nor to the affliction of others nor to the affliction of both it fosters discernment promotes lack of vexation leads to unbinding if i were to think ponder in line with that even for a night even for a day even for a day night i do not envision any danger that would come from it except that thinking pondering a long time would tire the body when the body is tired the mind is disturbed and a disturbed mind is far from concentration so i steadied my mind right within settled unified concentrated it why is that so that my mind would not be disturbed and as i remained thus heedful ardent resolute thinking imbued with non ill will arose in me i discerned that thinking imbued with non ill will has arisen in me and that leads neither to my own affliction nor to the affliction of others nor to the affliction of both it fosters discernment promotes lack of vexation leads to unbinding if i were to think ponder in line with that even for a night even for a day even for a day night i do not envision any danger that would come from it except that thinking pondering a long time would tire the body when the body is tired the mind is disturbed and a disturbed mind is far from concentration so i steadied my mind right within settled unified concentrated it why is that so that my mind would not be disturbed and as i remained thus heedful ardent resolute thinking imbued with harmlessness arose in me i discerned that thinking imbued with harmlessness has arisen in me and that leads neither to my own affliction nor to the affliction of others nor to the affliction of both it fosters discernment promotes lack of vexation leads to unbinding if i were to think ponder in line with that even for a night even for a day even for a day night i do not envision any danger that would come from it except that thinking pondering a long time would tire the body when the body is tired the mind is disturbed and a disturbed mind is far from concentration so i steadied my mind right within settled unified concentrated it why is that so that my mind would not be disturbed whatever a monk keeps pursuing with his thinking pondering that becomes the inclination of his awareness if a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with renunciation abandoning thinking imbued with sensuality his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with renunciation if a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with non ill will abandoning thinking imbued with ill will his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with non ill will if a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with harmlessness abandoning thinking imbued with harmfulness his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with harmlessness unflagging persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established my body was calm unaroused my mind concentrated single quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities i entered remained in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations i entered remained in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance with the fading of rapture i remained in equanimity mindful alert and physically sensitive of pleasure i entered remained in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding with the abandoning of pleasure pain as with the earlier disappearance of elation distress i entered remained in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain this was the first knowledge i attained in the first watch of the night ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose as happens in one who is heedful ardent resolute when the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady attained to imperturbability i directed it to the this was the second knowledge i attained in the second watch of the night ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose as happens in one who is heedful ardent resolute when the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady attained to imperturbability i directed it to the this was the third knowledge i attained in the third watch of the night ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose as happens in one who is heedful ardent resolute i have given this simile in order to convey a meaning the meaning is this the large low lying marsh stands for sensuality the large herd of deer stands for beings the man not desiring their benefit not desiring their welfare not desiring their rest from bondage stands for mara the evil one the false path stands for the eightfold wrong path i e wrong view wrong resolve wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness wrong concentration the male decoy stands for passion delight the female decoy stands for ignorance the man desiring their benefit desiring their welfare desiring their rest from bondage stands for the tathagata the worthy one the rightly self awakened one the safe restful path that led to their rapture stands for the noble eightfold path i e right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration so monks i have opened up the safe restful path closed off the false path removed the male decoy destroyed the female whatever a teacher should do seeking the welfare of his disciples out of sympathy for them that have i done for you over there are the roots of trees over there empty dwellings practice jhana monks don t be heedless don t later fall into regret this is our message to you that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near it is possible siha one who gives who is a master of giving is dear charming to people at large and the fact that who is generous a master of giving is dear charming to people at large this is a fruit of generosity visible in the here now furthermore good people people of integrity admire one who gives who is a master of giving and the fact that good people people of integrity admire one who gives who is a master of giving this too is a fruit of generosity visible in the here now furthermore the fine reputation of one who gives who is a master of giving is spread far wide and the fact that the fine reputation of one who gives who is a master of giving is spread far wide this too is a fruit of generosity visible in the here now furthermore when one who gives who is a master of giving approaches any assembly of people noble warriors brahmans householders or contemplatives he she does so confidently without embarrassment and the fact that when one who gives who is a master of giving approaches any assembly of people noble warriors brahmans householders or contemplatives he she does so confidently without embarrassment this too is a fruit of generosity visible in the here now furthermore at the break up of the body after death one who gives who is a master of giving reappears in a good destination the heavenly world and the fact that at the break up of the body after death one who gives who is a master of giving reappears in a good destination the heavenly world this is a fruit of generosity in the next life when this was said general siha said to the blessed one as for the four fruits of generosity visible in the here now that have been pointed out by the blessed one it s not the case that i go by conviction in the blessed one with regard to them i know them too i am one who gives a master of giving dear charming to people at large i am one who gives a master of giving good people people of integrity admire me i am one who gives a master of giving and my fine reputation is spread far wide siha is generous a doer a supporter of the sangha i am one who gives a master of giving and when i approach any assembly of people noble warriors brahmans householders or contemplatives i do so confidently without embarrassment but when the blessed one says to me at the break up of the body after death one who gives who is a master of giving reappears in a good destination the heavenly world that i do not know that is where i go by conviction in the blessed one so it is siha so it is at the break up of the body after death one who gives who is a master of giving reappears in a good destination the heavenly world one who gives is dear people at large admire him he gains honor his status grows he enters an assembly unembarrassed he is confident the man unmiserly therefore the wise give gifts seeking bliss they would subdue the stain of miserliness established in the three fold heavenly world they enjoy themselves long in fellowship with the devas having made the opportunity for themselves having done what is skillful then when they fall from here they fare on self radiant in nandana there is monks an inter cosmicwhen this was said one of the monks said to the blessed one wow what a great darkness what a really great darkness is there any darkness greater more frightening than that there is monk a darkness greater more frightening than that and which darkness lord is greater more frightening than that any brahmans or contemplatives who do not know as it actually is present that this is stress who do not know as it actually is present that this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress they revel in but as for any brahmans or contemplatives who do know as it actually is present that this is stress who know as it actually is present that this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress they don t revel in therefore monks your duty is the contemplation this is stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress your duty is the contemplation this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress there are these five rewards in listening to the dhamma which five one hears what one has not heard before one clarifies what one has heard before one gets rid of doubt one s views are made straight one s mind grows serene these are the five rewards in listening to the dhamma there are in the this is what happens to anyone who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of others for this reason you should not wander into what is not your proper range and is the territory of others in one who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of others wander monks in what is your proper range your own ancestral territory in one who wanders in what is his proper range his own ancestral territory mara gains no opening mara gains no foothold and what for a monk is his proper range his own ancestral territory monks i declare that the destruction of the cankers regarding this knowledge of destruction i declare that there is a supporting condition without which it does not arise thus monks ignorance is the supporting condition for the kamma formations there are some who dispute corrupted at heart and those who dispute their hearts set on truth but a sage doesn t enter a dispute that s arisen which is why he is nowhere constrained now how would one led on by desire entrenched in his likes forming his own conclusions overcome his own views he d dispute in line with the way that he knows whoever boasts to others unasked of his practices precepts is say the skilled ignoble by nature he who speaks of himself of his own accord but a monk at peace fully unbound in himself who doesn t boast of his precepts that s how i am he once the blessed one was dwelling among the sakyas in nigrodha park at kapilavatthu there mahanama the sakyan approached the blessed one having approached and paid respect to the blessed one he sat aside then seated aside mahanama the sakyan said thus to the blessed one venerable sir in what way is one a lay follower mahanama inasmuch as one has gone to the buddha for refuge has gone to the dhamma for refuge has gone to the sangha for refuge in that way mahanama one is a lay follower then venerable sir in what way is a lay follower virtuous mahanama inasmuch as a lay follower abstains from destroying living beings abstains from taking what is not given abstains from sexual misconduct abstains from lying and abstains from wine liquor and intoxicants that are causes for heedlessness in that way mahanama a lay follower is virtuous then venerable sir in what way is a lay follower engaged in his own welfare but not in others welfare then venerable sir in what way is a lay follower engaged in his own welfare and in others welfare mahanama inasmuch as a lay follower is possessed of faith himself and rouses others to possess faith is possessed of virtue himself and rouses others to possess virtue is possessed of liberality himself and rouses others to possess liberality is himself desirous of meeting with monks and rouses others to meet with monks is himself desirous of hearing the true dhamma and rouses others to hear the true dhamma is himself habitually mindful of the dhamma that is heard and rouses others to be mindful of the dhamma is himself ascertained of the meaning benefit of the dhamma that is heard and rouses others to ascertain the meaning benefit having known the meaning benefit having known the dhamma is himself committed to the practice according to the dhamma and rouses others to be committed to the practice according to the dhamma in that way mahanama a lay follower is engaged in his own welfare and in others welfare i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near lord for a long time i have lived in the wilderness and have extolled living in the wilderness i have been an almsgoer and have extolled being an almsgoer i have worn cast off rags and have extolled wearing cast off rags i have worn only one set of the triple robe and have extolled wearing only one set of the triple robe i have been modest and have extolled being modest i have been content and have extolled being content i have been reclusive and have extolled being reclusive i have been unentangled and have extolled being unentangled i have kept my persistence aroused and have extolled having persistence aroused but kassapa what compelling reason do you see that you for a long time have lived in the wilderness and have extolled living in the wilderness that you have kept your persistence aroused and have extolled having persistence aroused lord i see two compelling reasons that for a long time i have lived in the wilderness and have extolled living in the wilderness that i have kept my persistence aroused and have extolled having persistence aroused seeing a pleasant abiding for myself in the here now and feeling sympathy for later generations perhaps later generations will take it as an example it seems that the disciples of the awakened one and those who awakened after him lived for a long time in the wilderness and extolled living in the wilderness were almsgoers and extolled being almsgoers wore cast off rags and extolled wearing cast off rags wore only one set of the triple robe and extolled wearing only one set of the triple robe were modest and extolled being modest were content and extolled being content were reclusive and extolled being reclusive were unentangled and extolled being unentangled kept their persistence aroused and extolled having persistence aroused good kassapa very good it seems that you are one who practices for the happiness of many out of compassion for the world for the welfare benefit happiness of beings human divine so continue wearing your robes of cast off hemp cloth go for alms and live in the wilderness dhotaka the buddha dhotaka the buddha you dhotaka the buddha dhotaka the buddha son of the buddha and his heir is he great kassapa his mind serene collected vision of previous lives is his heaven and hell he penetrates the ceasing of rebirth he has obtained and supernormal knowledge he has mastered with these three knowledges possessed by him he is a brahman true of threefold knowledge so has she too bhadda the kapilani gained for herself the threefold knowledge and has vanquished death having bravely vanquished mara and his host it is the last formation of a body that she bears seeing the world s deep misery we both went forth and are now both free of cankers with well tamed minds cooled of passions we have found deliverance cooled of passions we have found our freedom with subtle veils adorned garlands and sandal wood bedecked covered all over with ornaments surrounded by my servants taking with us food and drink eatables of many kinds setting off from the house to the forest grove we took it all having enjoyed and sported there we turned our feet to home but on the way i saw and entered near saketa a monastery seeing the light of the world i drew near bowed down to him out of compassion the seeing one then taught me dhamma there hearing the words of the great sage i penetrated truth the dhamma passionless i touched the dhamma of deathlessness when the true dhamma had been known i went forth to the homeless life the three true knowledges are attained not empty the buddha s teaching i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near then when it was evening ven malunkyaputta arose from seclusion and went to the blessed one on arrival having bowed down he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one lord just now as i was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in my awareness these positions that are undeclared set aside discarded by the blessed one i don t approve i don t accept that the blessed one has not declared them to me i ll go ask the blessed one about this matter if he declares to me that the cosmos is eternal or that after death a tathagata neither exists nor does not exist then i will live the holy life under him if he does not declare to me that the cosmos is eternal or that after death a tathagata neither exists nor does not exist then i will renounce the training and return to the lower life lord if the blessed one knows that the cosmos is eternal then may he declare to me that the cosmos is eternal if he knows that the cosmos is not eternal then may he declare to me that the cosmos is not eternal but if he doesn t know or see whether the cosmos is eternal or not eternal then in one who is unknowing unseeing the straightforward thing is to admit i don t know i don t see if he doesn t know or see whether after death a tathagata exists does not exist both exists does not exist neither exists nor does not exist then in one who is unknowing unseeing the straightforward thing is to admit i don t know i don t see malunkyaputta did i ever say to you come malunkyaputta live the holy life under me and i will declare to you that the cosmos is eternal or the cosmos is not eternal or the cosmos is finite or the cosmos is infinite or the soul the body are the same or the soul is one thing and the body another or after death a tathagata exists or after death a tathagata does not exist or after death a tathagata both exists does not exist or after death a tathagata neither exists nor does not exist no lord and did you ever say to me lord i will live the holy life under the blessed one and in return he will declare to me that the cosmos is eternal or the cosmos is not eternal or the cosmos is finite or the cosmos is infinite or the soul the body are the same or the soul is one thing and the body another or after death a tathagata exists or after death a tathagata does not exist or after death a tathagata both exists does not exist or after death a tathagata neither exists nor does not exist no lord then that being the case foolish man who are you to be claiming grievances making demands of anyone malunkyaputta if anyone were to say i won t live the holy life under the blessed one as long as he does not declare to me that the cosmos is eternal or that after death a tathagata neither exists nor does not exist the man would die and those things would still remain undeclared by the tathagata it s in the same way if anyone were to say i won t live the holy life under the blessed one as long as he does not declare to me that the cosmos is eternal or that after death a tathagata neither exists nor does not exist the man would die and those things would still remain undeclared by the tathagata malunkyaputta it s not the case that when there is the view the cosmos is eternal there is the living of the holy life and it s not the case that when there is the view the cosmos is not eternal there is the living of the holy life when there is the view the cosmos is eternal and when there is the view the cosmos is not eternal there is still the birth there is the aging there is the death there is the sorrow lamentation pain despair distress whose destruction i make known right in the here now it s not the case that when there is the view the cosmos is finite there is the living of the holy life and it s not the case that when there is the view the cosmos is infinite there is the living of the holy life when there is the view the cosmos is finite and when there is the view the cosmos is infinite there is still the birth there is the aging there is the death there is the sorrow lamentation pain despair distress whose destruction i make known right in the here now it s not the case that when there is the view the soul the body are the same there is the living of the holy life and it s not the case that when there is the view the soul is one thing and the body another there is the living of the holy life when there is the view the soul the body are the same and when there is the view the soul is one thing and the body another there is still the birth there is the aging there is the death there is the sorrow lamentation pain despair distress whose destruction i make known right in the here now it s not the case that when there is the view after death a tathagata exists there is the living of the holy life and it s not the case that when there is the view after death a tathagata does not exist there is the living of the holy life and it s not the case that when there is the view after death a tathagata both exists does not exist there is the living of the holy life and it s not the case that when there is the view after death a tathagata neither exists nor does not exist there is the living of the holy life when there is the view after death a tathagata exists after death a tathagata does not exist after death a tathagata both exists does not exist after death a tathagata neither exists nor does not exist there is still the birth there is the aging there is the death there is the sorrow lamentation pain despair distress whose destruction i make known right in the here now so malunkyaputta remember what is undeclared by me as undeclared and what is declared by me as declared and what is undeclared by me the cosmos is eternal is undeclared by me the cosmos is not eternal is undeclared by me the cosmos is finite the cosmos is infinite the soul the body are the same the soul is one thing and the body another after death a tathagata exists after death a tathagata does not exist after death a tathagata both exists does not exist after death a tathagata neither exists nor does not exist is undeclared by me and why are they undeclared by me because they are not connected with the goal are not fundamental to the holy life they do not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation calming direct knowledge self awakening unbinding that s why they are undeclared by me and what is declared by me this is stress is declared by me this is the origination of stress is declared by me this is the cessation of stress is declared by me this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress is declared by me and why are they declared by me because they are connected with the goal are fundamental to the holy life they lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation calming direct knowledge self awakening unbinding that s why they are declared by me so malunkyaputta remember what is undeclared by me as undeclared and what is declared by me as declared that is what the blessed one said gratified ven malunkyaputta delighted in the blessed one s words on one occasion the blessed one was staying near then talaputa the head of an acting troupe went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one lord i have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of actors that when an actor on the stage in the midst of a festival makes people laugh gives them delight with his imitation of reality then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas what does the blessed one have to say about that enough headman put that aside don t ask me that a second time a third time talaputa the head of an acting troupe said lord i have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of actors that when an actor on the stage in the midst of a festival makes people laugh gives them delight with his imitation of reality then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas what does the blessed one have to say about that apparently headman i haven t been able to get past you by saying enough headman put that aside don t ask me that so i will simply answer you any beings who are not devoid of passion to begin with who are bound by the bond of passion focus with even more passion on things inspiring passion presented by an actor on stage in the midst of a festival any beings who are not devoid of aversion to begin with who are bound by the bond of aversion focus with even more aversion on things inspiring aversion presented by an actor on stage in the midst of a festival any beings who are not devoid of delusion to begin with who are bound by the bond of delusion focus with even more delusion on things inspiring delusion presented by an actor on stage in the midst of a festival thus the actor himself intoxicated heedless having made others intoxicated heedless with the breakup of the body after death is reborn in what is called the hell of laughter but if he holds such a view as this when an actor on the stage in the midst of a festival makes people laugh gives them delight with his imitation of reality then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas that is his wrong view now there are two destinations for a person with wrong view i tell you either hell or the animal womb when this was said talaputa the head of an acting troupe sobbed burst into tears the blessed one said that is what i couldn t get past you by saying enough headman put that aside don t ask me that i m not crying lord because of what the blessed one said to me but simply because i have been deceived cheated fooled for a long time by that ancient teaching lineage of actors who said when an actor on the stage in the midst of a festival makes people laugh gives them delight with his imitation of reality then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas i have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling among the then the devata inhabiting the forest thicket feeling sympathy for the monk desiring his benefit desiring to bring him to his senses approached him and addressed him with this verse desiring seclusion you ve entered the forest and yet your mind goes running outside you a person subdue your desire for people then you ll be happy free from passion dispel discontent be mindful let me remind you of that which is good for the dust of the regions below is hard to transcend don t let the dust of the sensual pull you down the monk chastened by the devata came to his senses as a bird monks there are these and what is the yoke of and how is there the yoke of and how is there the yoke of and how is there the yoke of conjoined with evil unskillful mental qualities defiling leading to further becoming unhappy resulting in suffering stress and in future birth aging death one is said not to be at rest from the yoke these are the four yokes now there are these and what is unyoking from sensuality there is the case where a certain person discerns as it actually is present the origination the passing away the allure the drawbacks the escape from sensuality when he discerns as it actually is present the origination the passing away the allure the drawbacks the escape from sensuality then with regard to sensual objects he is not obsessed with sensual passion sensual delight sensual attraction sensual infatuation sensual thirst sensual fever sensual fascination sensual craving this is unyoking from sensuality and how is there unyoking from becoming there is the case where a certain person discerns as it actually is present the origination the passing away the allure the drawbacks and the escape from becoming when he discerns as it actually is present the origination the passing away the allure the drawbacks and the escape from becoming then with regard to states of becoming he is not obsessed with becoming passion becoming delight becoming attraction becoming infatuation becoming thirst becoming fever becoming fascination becoming craving this is unyoking from sensuality unyoking from becoming and how is there unyoking from views there is the case where a certain person discerns as it actually is present the origination the passing away the allure the drawbacks the escape from views when he discerns as it actually is present the origination the passing away the allure the drawbacks the escape from views then with regard to views he is not obsessed with view passion view delight view attraction view infatuation view thirst view fever view fascination view craving this is unyoking from sensuality unyoking from becoming unyoking from views and how is there unyoking from ignorance there is the case where a certain person discerns as it actually is present the origination the passing away the allure the drawbacks the escape from the six sense media when he discerns as it actually is present the origination the passing away the allure the drawbacks and the escape from the six sense media then with regard to ignorance concerning the six sense media he is not obsessed with not knowing this is unyoking from sensuality unyoking from becoming unyoking from views unyoking from ignorance disjoined from evil unskillful mental qualities defiling leading to further becoming unhappy resulting in suffering stress and in future birth aging death one is said to be at rest from the yoke these are the four unyokings joined with the yoke of sensuality the yoke of becoming joined with the yoke of views surrounded by ignorance beings go to the wandering on heading to birth death but those who comprehend sensuality the yoke of becoming entirely who have thrown off the yoke of views and are dispassionate toward ignorance disjoined from all yokes they their yokes overcome are sages indeed i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one on a wandering tour among the kosalans with a large community of monks arrived at a kosalan brahman village named icchanangala there he stayed in the icchanangala forest grove the brahman householders of icchanangala heard it said gotama the contemplative the son of the sakyans having gone forth from the sakyan clan on a wandering tour among the kosalans with a large community of monks has arrived at icchanangala and is staying in the icchanangala forest grove and of that master gotama this fine reputation has spread he is indeed a blessed one worthy rightly self awakened consummate in knowledge conduct well gone a knower of the cosmos an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed teacher of human divine beings awakened blessed he has made known having realized it through direct knowledge this world with its devas maras brahmas its generations with their contemplatives brahmans their rulers common people has explained the dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end has expounded the holy life both in its particulars in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure it is good to see such a worthy one so the brahman householders of icchanangala when the night was gone taking many staple non staple foods went to the gate house of the icchanangala forest grove on arrival they stood there making a loud racket a great racket now at that time ven nagita was the blessed one s attendant so the blessed one addressed ven nagita nagita what is that loud racket that great racket like fishermen with a catch of fish lord those are the brahman householders of icchanangala standing at the gate house to the icchanangala forest grove having brought many staple non staple foods for the sake of the blessed one the community of monks may i have nothing to do with honor nagita and honor nothing to do with me whoever cannot obtain at will without difficulty without trouble as i do the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of self awakening let him consent to this slimy excrement pleasure this torpor pleasure this pleasure of gains offerings fame lord let the blessed one acquiesce to their offerings now let the one well gone acquiesce now now is the time for the blessed one s acquiescence lord now is the time for the blessed one s acquiescence lord wherever the blessed one will go now the brahmans of the towns countryside will be so inclined just as when the rain devas send rain in fat drops the waters flow with the incline in the same way wherever the blessed one will go now the brahmans of the towns countryside will be so inclined why is that because such is the blessed one s virtue discernment may i have nothing to do with honor nagita and honor nothing to do with me whoever cannot obtain at will without difficulty without trouble as i do the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of self awakening let him consent to this slimy excrement pleasure this torpor pleasure this pleasure of gains offerings fame even some devas nagita cannot obtain at will without difficulty without trouble as i do the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of self awakening when you all live together assemble together and live committed to dwelling with a group the thought occurs surely these venerable ones cannot obtain at will without difficulty without trouble as i do the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of self awakening which is why they live together assemble together and live committed to dwelling with a group there is the case nagita where i see monks laughing out loud sporting around tickling one another with their fingers the thought occurs to me surely these venerable ones cannot obtain at will without difficulty without trouble as i do the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of self awakening which is why they are laughing out loud sporting around tickling one another with their fingers then there is the case where i see monks having eaten as much as they want filling their bellies live committed to the pleasure of lying down the pleasure of sensory contacts the pleasure of torpor the thought occurs to me surely these venerable ones cannot obtain at will without difficulty without trouble as i do the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of self awakening which is why they having eaten as much as they want filling their bellies live committed to the pleasure of lying down the pleasure of sensory contacts the pleasure of torpor then there is the case where i see a monk sitting in concentration in a village dwelling the thought occurs to me soon a monastery attendant will disturb this venerable one in some way or a novice will and rouse him from his concentration and so i am not pleased with that monk s village dwelling but then there is the case where i see a monk sitting nodding in the wilderness the thought occurs to me soon this venerable one will dispel his drowsiness fatigue and attend to the wilderness perception then there is the case where i see a wilderness monk sitting unconcentrated in the wilderness the thought occurs to me soon this venerable one will center his unconcentrated mind or protect his concentrated mind and so i am pleased with that monk s wilderness dwelling then there is the case where i see a wilderness monk sitting in concentration in the wilderness the thought occurs to me soon this venerable one will release his unreleased mind or protect his released mind and so i am pleased with that monk s wilderness dwelling then there is the case where i see a village dwelling monk who receives robes alms food shelter medicinal requisites for curing the sick receiving as he likes those gains offerings fame he neglects seclusion he neglects isolated forest wilderness dwellings he makes his living by visiting villages towns cities and so i am not pleased with that monk s village dwelling then there is the case where i see a wilderness monk who receives robes alms food shelter medicinal requisites for curing the sick fending off those gains offerings fame he doesn t neglect seclusion doesn t neglect isolated forest wilderness dwellings and so i am pleased with that monk s wilderness dwelling but when i am traveling along a road and see no one in front or behind me at that time i have my ease even when urinating defecating jatukannin the buddha subdue greedbefore after in between savatthianathapindika s monastery yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said monks i will teach you the summary exposition of one who has had an auspicious day listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks replied the blessed one said you shouldn t chase after the past or place expectations on the future what is past is left behind the future is as yet unreached whatever quality is present you clearly see right there right there not taken in unshaken that s how you develop the heart ardently doing what should be done today for who knows tomorrow death there is no bargaining with mortality his mighty horde whoever lives thus ardently relentlessly both day night has truly had an auspicious day so says the peaceful sage and how monks does one chase after the past one gets carried away with the delight of in the past i had such a form body in the past i had such a feeling in the past i had such a perception in the past i had such a thought fabrication in the past i had such a consciousness this is called chasing after the past and how does one not chase after the past one does not get carried away with the delight of in the past i had such a form body in the past i had such a feeling in the past i had such a perception in the past i had such a thought fabrication in the past i had such a consciousness this is called not chasing after the past and how does one place expectations on the future one gets carried away with the delight of in the future i might have such a form body in the future i might have such a feeling in the future i might have such a perception in the future i might have such a thought fabrication in the future i might have such a consciousness this is called placing expectations on the future and how does one not place expectations on the future one does not get carried away with the delight of in the future i might have such a form body in the future i might have such a feeling in the future i might have such a perception in the future i might have such a thought fabrication in the future i might have such a consciousness this is called not placing expectations on the future and how is one taken in with regard to present qualities there is the case where an uninstructed run of the mill person who has not seen the noble ones is not versed in the teachings of the noble ones is not trained in the teachings of the noble ones sees form as self or self as possessing form or form as in self or self as in form he she sees feeling as self or self as possessing feeling or feeling as in self or self as in feeling he she sees perception as self or self as possessing perception or perception as in self or self as in perception he she sees thought fabrications as self or self as possessing thought fabrications or thought fabrications as in self or self as in thought fabrications he she sees consciousness as self or self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousness this is called being taken in with regard to present qualities and how is one not taken in with regard to present qualities there is the case where a disciple of the noble ones who has seen the noble ones is versed in the teachings of the noble ones is well trained in the teachings of the noble ones does not see form as self or self as possessing form or form as in self or self as in form he she does not see feeling as self or self as possessing feeling or feeling as in self or self as in feeling he she does not see perception as self or self as possessing perception or perception as in self or self as in perception he she does not see thought fabrications as self or self as possessing thought fabrications or thought fabrications as in self or self as in thought fabrications he she does not see consciousness as self or self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousness this is called not being taken in with regard to present qualities you shouldn t chase after the past or place expectations on the future what is past is left behind the future is as yet unreached whatever quality is present you clearly see right there right there not taken in unshaken that s how you develop the heart ardently doing what should be done today for who knows tomorrow death there is no bargaining with mortality his mighty horde whoever lives thus ardently relentlessly both day night has truly had an auspicious day so says the peaceful sage monks i will teach you the summary exposition of one who has had an auspicious day thus was it said and in reference to this was it said that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words monks there are brahmans contemplatives who hold this teaching hold this view whatever a person experiences pleasant painful or neither pleasant nor painful that is all caused by what was done in the past there are brahmans contemplatives who hold this teaching hold this view whatever a person experiences pleasant painful or neither pleasant nor painful that is all caused by a supreme being s act of creation there are brahmans contemplatives who hold this teaching hold this view whatever a person experiences pleasant painful or neither pleasant nor painful that is all without cause without condition having approached the brahmans contemplatives who hold that whatever a person experiences is all caused by what was done in the past i said to them is it true that you hold that whatever a person experiences is all caused by what was done in the past thus asked by me they admitted yes then i said to them then in that case a person is a killer of living beings because of what was done in the past a person is a thief unchaste a liar a divisive speaker a harsh speaker an idle chatterer greedy malicious a holder of wrong views because of what was done in the past when one falls back on what was done in the past as being essential monks there is no desire no effort at the thought this should be done this shouldn t be done when one can t pin down as a truth or reality what should shouldn t be done one dwells bewildered unprotected one cannot righteously refer to oneself as a contemplative this was my first righteous refutation of those brahmans contemplatives who hold to such teachings such views having approached the brahmans contemplatives who hold that whatever a person experiences is all caused by a supreme being s act of creation i said to them is it true that you hold that whatever a person experiences is all caused by a supreme being s act of creation thus asked by me they admitted yes then i said to them then in that case a person is a killer of living beings because of a supreme being s act of creation a person is a thief unchaste a liar a divisive speaker a harsh speaker an idle chatterer greedy malicious a holder of wrong views because of a supreme being s act of creation when one falls back on creation by a supreme being as being essential monks there is no desire no effort at the thought this should be done this shouldn t be done when one can t pin down as a truth or reality what should shouldn t be done one dwells bewildered unprotected one cannot righteously refer to oneself as a contemplative this was my second righteous refutation of those brahmans contemplatives who hold to such teachings such views having approached the brahmans contemplatives who hold that whatever a person experiences is all without cause without condition i said to them is it true that you hold that whatever a person experiences is all without cause without condition thus asked by me they admitted yes then i said to them then in that case a person is a killer of living beings without cause without condition a person is a thief unchaste a liar a divisive speaker a harsh speaker an idle chatterer greedy malicious a holder of wrong views without cause without condition when one falls back on lack of cause and lack of condition as being essential monks there is no desire no effort at the thought this should be done this shouldn t be done when one can t pin down as a truth or reality what should shouldn t be done one dwells bewildered unprotected one cannot righteously refer to oneself as a contemplative this was my third righteous refutation of those brahmans contemplatives who hold to such teachings such views these are the three sectarian guilds that when cross examined pressed for reasons rebuked by wise people even though they may explain otherwise remain stuck in inaction but this dhamma taught by me is unrefuted undefiled blameless not faulted by knowledgeable brahmans contemplatives and which dhamma taught by me is unrefuted undefiled blameless not faulted by knowledgeable brahmans contemplatives there are these six properties is a dhamma taught by me that is unrefuted undefiled blameless not faulted by knowledgeable brahmans contemplatives there are these six media of sensory contact is a dhamma taught by me that is unrefuted undefiled blameless not faulted by knowledgeable brahmans contemplatives there are these eighteen explorations for the intellect is a dhamma taught by me that is unrefuted undefiled blameless not faulted by knowledgeable brahmans contemplatives there are these four noble truths is a dhamma taught by me that is unrefuted undefiled blameless not faulted by knowledgeable brahmans contemplatives sustained by clinging to the six properties there is an alighting of an embryo there being an alighting there is name form from name form as a requisite condition come the six sense media from the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact from contact as a requisite condition comes feeling to one experiencing feeling i declare this is stress i declare this is the origination of stress i declare this is the cessation of stress i declare this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress and what is the noble truth of stress birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress despair are stressful association with what is not loved is stressful separation from what is loved is stressful not getting what is wanted is stressful in short the five clinging aggregates are stressful this is called the noble truth of stress and what is the noble truth of the origination of stress from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications from fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name form from name form as a requisite condition come the six sense media from the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact from contact as a requisite condition comes feeling from feeling as a requisite condition comes craving from craving as a requisite condition comes clinging sustenance from clinging sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth from birth as a requisite condition then old age death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair come into play such is the origination of this entire mass of stress suffering this is called the noble truth of the origination of stress and what is the noble truth of the cessation of stress from the remainderless fading cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications from the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness from the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name form from the cessation of name form comes the cessation of the six sense media from the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact from the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling from the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving from the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging sustenance from the cessation of clinging sustenance comes the cessation of becoming from the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth from the cessation of birth then old age death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair all cease such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress suffering this is called the noble truth of the cessation of stress and what is the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress just this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration this is called the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress there are these four noble truths is a dhamma taught by me that is unrefuted undefiled blameless not faulted by knowledgeable brahmans contemplatives thus was it said and in reference to this was it said even if a monk is not skilled in the ways of the minds of others if on examination he knows i am one who achieves internal tranquility of awareness but not insight into phenomena through heightened discernment then his duty is to make an effort for the maintenance of internal tranquility of awareness and for insight into phenomena through heightened discernment at a later time he will then be one who achieves both internal tranquility of awareness and insight into phenomena through heightened discernment but if on examination the monk knows i am one who achieves insight into phenomena through heightened discernment but not internal tranquility of awareness then his duty is to make an effort for the maintenance of insight into phenomena through heightened discernment and for internal tranquility of awareness at a later time he will then be one who achieves both insight into phenomena through heightened discernment and internal tranquility of awareness but if on examination the monk knows i am one who achieves neither internal tranquility of awareness nor insight into phenomena through heightened discernment then he should put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor relentlessness mindfulness alertness for gaining those very same skillful qualities but if on examination the monk knows i am one who achieves both internal tranquility of awareness and insight into phenomena through heightened discernment then his duty is to make an effort in maintaining those very same skillful qualities to a higher degree for the ending of the effluents monks i speak of robes in two ways to be partaken of and not to be partaken of i also speak of alms food lodgings villages towns countrysides individuals in two ways to be partaken of and not to be partaken of monks i speak of robes in two ways to be partaken of and not to be partaken of thus was it said in reference to what was it said any robe of which one has come to know when i partake of this robe unskillful qualities increase and skillful qualities decrease that sort of robe is not to be partaken of any robe of which one has come to know when i partake of this robe unskillful qualities decrease and skillful qualities increase that sort of robe is to be partaken of monks i speak of robes in two ways to be partaken of and not to be partaken of thus was it said and in reference to this was it said monks i also speak of alms food in two ways monks i also speak of lodgings in two ways monks i also speak of villages towns in two ways monks i also speak of countrysides in two ways monks i also speak of individuals in two ways to be partaken of and not to be partaken of thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was dwelling at savatthi in jeta s grove anathapindika s park then in the morning the bhikkhuni alavika dressed and taking bowl and robe entered savatthi for alms when she had walked for alms in savatthi and had returned from her alms round after her meal she went to the blind men s grove seeking seclusion then mara the evil one desiring to arouse fear trepidation and terror in the bhikkhuni alavika desiring to make her fall away from seclusion approached her and addressed her in verse there is no escape in the world so what will you do with seclusion enjoy the delights of sensual pleasure don t be remorseful later then it occurred to the bhikkhuni alavika now who is it that recited the verse a human being or a non human being then it occurred to her this is mara the evil one who has recited the verse desiring to arouse fear trepidation and terror in me desiring to make me fall away from seclusion then the bhikkhuni alavika having understood this is mara the evil one replied to him in verses there is an escape in the world which i have closely touched with wisdom o evil one kinsman of the negligent you do not know that state sensual pleasures are like sword stakes the aggregates their chopping block what you call sensual delight has become for me non delight then mara the evil one realizing the bhikkhuni alavika knows me sad and disappointed disappeared right there on one occasion the blessed one was staying near so cunda the novice taking ven sariputta s bowl robes went to cunda my friend this news is reason for seeing the blessed one come let s go to the blessed one and report this matter to him yes venerable sir cunda the novice replied so ven ananda cunda the novice went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there ven ananda said to him lord just now cunda the novice said to me venerable sir ven sariputta has attained total unbinding here are his bowl robes it was as if my body were drugged i lost my bearings things weren t clear to me on hearing that ven sariputta had attained total unbinding but ananda when he attained total unbinding did sariputta take the aggregate of virtue along with him did he take the aggregate of concentration discernment release the aggregate of knowledge vision of release along with him no lord when he attained total unbinding ven sariputta didn t take the aggregate of virtue concentration discernment release the aggregate of knowledge vision of release along with him it s just that he was my instructor counselor one who exhorted urged roused encouraged me he was tireless in teaching the dhamma a help to his companions in the holy life we miss the nourishment of his dhamma the wealth of his dhamma his help in the dhamma but ananda haven t i already taught you the state of growing different with regard to all things dear appealing the state of becoming separate the state of becoming otherwise what else is there to expect it s impossible that one could forbid anything born existent fabricated subject to disintegration from disintegrating therefore ananda each of you should remain with your self as an a monk endowed with five qualities practices both for his own benefit and for that of others which five there is the case where a monk is himself consummate in virtue and encourages others to be consummate in virtue he himself is consummate in concentration and encourages others to be consummate in concentration he himself is consummate in discernment and encourages others to be consummate in discernment he himself is consummate in release and encourages others to be consummate in release he himself is consummate in the knowledge vision of release and encourages others to be consummate in the knowledge vision of release endowed with these five qualities a monk practices both for his own benefit and for that of others monks be islands unto yourselves here monks the uninstructed worldling but seeing thus have i heard at one time the lord was staying at uruvela beside the river nera jara at the foot of the bodhi tree having just realized full enlightenment at that time the lord sat cross legged for seven days experiencing the bliss of liberation then at the end of those seven days the lord emerged from that concentration and gave well reasoned attention during the first watch of the night to dependent arising in forward order thus then on realizing its significance the lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance when things become manifest to the ardent meditating brahman all his doubts then vanish since he understands each thing along with its cause danger is born from intimacy unstartledunsnaredunsmearedlike truly asjtb ag counts this sutta as an as near as i can figure pts counts it as ii monks these two are fools which two the one who takes up a burden that hasn t fallen to him and the one who doesn t take up a burden that has these two are fools then janussonin the brahman went to the blessed one and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one master gotama you know that we brahmans give gifts make offerings saying may this gift accrue to our dead relatives may our dead relatives partake of this gift now master gotama does that gift accrue to our dead relatives do our dead relatives partake of that gift in possible places brahman it accrues to them but not in impossible places and which master gotama are the possible places which are the impossible places but master gotama if that dead relative does not reappear in that possible place who partakes of that gift other dead relatives brahman who have reappeared in that possible place but master gotama if that dead relative does not reappear in that possible place and other dead relatives have not reappeared in that possible place then who partakes of that gift it s impossible brahman it cannot be that over this long time that possible place is devoid of one s dead relatives does master gotama describe any preparation for the impossible places then there is the case where a certain person takes life has wrong views but he gives food lamps to brahmans contemplatives with the break up of the body after death he reappears in the company of horses in the company of cattle in the company of poultry there he receives food drink flowers various ornaments then there is the case where a certain person refrains from taking life refrains from taking what is not given refrains from sensual misconduct refrains from false speech refrains from divisive speech refrains from abusive speech refrains from idle chatter is not covetous bears no ill will and has right views and he gives food drink cloth vehicles garlands scents creams bed lodging lamps to brahmans contemplatives with the break up of the body after death he reappears in the company of human beings there he experiences the five strings of human sensuality delightful sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations it s because he refrained from taking what is not given refrained from sensual misconduct refrained from false speech refrained from divisive speech refrained from abusive speech refrained from idle chatter was not covetous bore no ill will and had right views that he reappears in the company of human beings and it s because he gave food drink cloth vehicles garlands scents creams bed lodging lamps to brahmans contemplatives that he experiences the five strings of human sensuality then there is the case where a certain person refrains from taking life and has right views and he gives food drink cloth vehicles garlands scents creams bed lodging lamps to brahmans contemplatives with the break up of the body after death he reappears in the company of devas there he experiences the five strings of divine sensuality delightful sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations it s because he refrained from taking what is not given and had right views that he reappears in the company of devas and it s because he gave food drink cloth vehicles garlands scents creams bed lodging lamps to brahmans contemplatives that he experiences the five strings of divine sensuality but at any rate brahman the donor does not go without reward it s amazing master gotama it s astounding how it s enough to make one want to give a gift enough to make one want to make an offering where the donor does not go without reward that s the way it is brahman that s the way it is the donor does not go without reward on one occasion the blessed one while wandering on tour among the now at that time nalanda was in the midst of famine a time of scarcity the crops white with blight and turned to straw and at that time but how venerable sir will i refute the words of gotama the contemplative so mighty so powerful come now headman go to gotama the contemplative and on arrival say this venerable sir doesn t the blessed one in many ways praise kindness protection sympathy for families if gotama the contemplative thus asked answers yes headman the tathagata in many ways praises kindness protection sympathy for families then you should say then why venerable sir is the blessed one together with a large community of monks wandering on tour around nalanda in the midst of famine a time of scarcity when the crops are white with blight and turned to straw the blessed one is practicing for the ruin of families the blessed one is practicing for the demise of families the blessed one is practicing for the downfall of families when gotama the contemplative is asked this two pronged question by you he won t be able to swallow it down or spit it up responding as you say venerable sir asibandhakaputta the headman got up from his seat bowed down to nigantha nataputta circumambulated him and then went to the blessed one on arrival he bowed down to the blessed one and sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one venerable sir doesn t the blessed one in many ways praise kindness protection sympathy for families yes headman the tathagata in many ways praises kindness protection sympathy for families then why venerable sir is the blessed one together with a large community of monks wandering on tour around nalanda in the midst of famine a time of scarcity when the crops are white with blight and turned to straw the blessed one is practicing for the ruin of families the blessed one is practicing for the demise of families the blessed one is practicing for the downfall of families headman recollecting back over aeons i do not know any family to have been brought to downfall through the giving of cooked alms on the contrary whatever families are rich with much wealth many possessions a great deal of money a great many accoutrements of wealth a great many commodities all have become so from giving from truth from restraint i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was dwelling among the then a great meeting in the woods the deva hosts have assembled we have come to this dhamma meeting to see the invincible sangha then another devata recited this verse in the blessed one s presence the bhikkhus there are concentrated have straightened their own minds like a charioteer holding the reins the wise ones guard their faculties then another devata recited this verse in the blessed one s presence having cut through barrenness cut the cross bar having uprooted then another devata recited this verse in the blessed one s presence those who have gone to the buddha for refuge will not go to the plane of woe on discarding the human body they will fill the hosts of the devas then the blessed one addressed the monks monks most of the devatas from ten world systems have gathered in order to see the tathagata and the bhikkhu sangha those who in the past were pure ones rightly self awakened at most had their devata gathering like mine at the present those who in the future will be pure ones rightly self awakened will at most have their devata gathering like mine at the present i will detail for you the names of the deva hosts i will describe to you the names of the deva hosts i will teach you the names of the deva hosts listen and pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks replied the blessed one said i recite a verse of tribute those who live where spirits dwell who live in mountain caves resolute concentrated many like hidden lions who have overcome horripilation white hearted pure serene and undisturbed knowing that more than of them had come to the forest of kapilavatthu the teacher then said to them disciples delighting in his instruction the deva hosts have approached detect them monks listening to the awakened one s instruction they made an ardent effort knowledge appeared to them vision of non human beings some saw some some some had vision of non human beings some gained vision of innumerable devas filling every direction realizing all this the one with vision felt moved to speak the teacher then said to them disciples delighting in his instruction the deva hosts have approached detect them monks as i describe their glories one by one yakkhas inhabiting the land of kapilavatthu powerful effulgent glamorous prestigious rejoicing have approached the monks forest meeting yakkhas from the at savatthi monks eye contact is inconstant changeable alterable ear contact nose contact tongue contact body contact intellect contact is inconstant changeable alterable one who has conviction belief that these phenomena are this way is called a faith follower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the run of the mill he is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry shades he is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry one who after pondering with a modicum of discernment has accepted that these phenomena are this way is called a dhamma follower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the run of the mill he is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry shades he is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry one who knows and sees that these phenomena are this way is called a stream enterer steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for self awakening crimson now sir are the trees of the forest having shed their foliage they re eager to fruit their flowers are blazing forth like brilliant flames it is a luscious time of year great hero the blossoming trees so pleasing to the mind spread their fragrance in every direction surrendering their leaves and longing for fruit the time has come to depart from here hero it is neither too cold nor again too hot the season is pleasant suited for travel my lord let the sakyas and koliyas see you facing westward and crossing the rohini my son you weep for one whose path you do not really comprehend whether he s coming or going from where has that son of yours come and yet for one whose path you know for him you do not grieve at all whether he s coming or going such is the nature of creatures uninvited he came from there unpermitted he s gone from here and having come from who knows where he lived for but a few short days but though gone from here by one path he goes from there by another departed with a human form he will go flowing on and on as he has come so has he gone what is there here to grieve about my thorn indeed has been removed buried in the heart so hard to see that grief which had overcome me grief for my son has been dispelled today the thorn has been removed without hunger i ve become quenched to buddha dhamma and sangha i go to the sage for refuge well now maalu nkyaputta what am i to say to the younger monks if you a frail aged venerable man far gone in years at the end of your life ask for instruction in brief what do you think maalu nkyaputta objects cognizable by the eye not seen which you have not seen before which you do not see now and do not wish to see have you any desire lust and fondness for them no indeed lord well then maalu nkyaputta in things seen heard sensed indeed lord i understand in full the meaning of what the blessed one has stated in brief forms perceived cause loss of mindfulness if we dwell on their endearing charms passion grips the heart and feeling flows clinging has us firmly in its grip so emotions rise and grow in strength of divers kinds all based on what was seen some of greed and some of hatred born grievously they all afflict the heart of man heaping up his store of pain and woe thus for him nibbaana s far away indeed lord i understand in full the meaning of what the blessed one has stated in brief thus have i heard at one time the lord was staying near savatthi in the jeta wood at anathapindika s monastery on that occasion the lord was instructing the bhikkhus with a dhamma talk connected with nibbana and those bhikkhus were intent on listening to dhamma then on realizing its significance the lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance only here is there purity that s what they say no other doctrines are pure so they say insisting that what they depend on is good they are deeply entrenched in their personal truths seeking controversy they plunge into an assembly regarding one another as fools relying on others authority they speak in debate desiring praise they claim to be skilled engaged in disputes in the midst of the assembly anxious desiring praise the one defeated is chagrined shaken with criticism he seeks for an opening he whose doctrine is judged as demolished defeated by those judging the issue he laments he grieves the inferior exponent he beat me he mourns these disputes have arisen among contemplatives in them are elation dejection seeing this one should abstain from disputes for they have no other goal than the gaining of praise he who is praised there for expounding his doctrine in the midst of the assembly laughs on that account grows haughty attaining his heart s desire that haughtiness will be his grounds for vexation for he ll speak in pride conceit seeing this one should abstain from debates no purity is attained by them say the skilled like ai have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near skillful virtues have freedom from remorse as their purpose ananda and freedom from remorse as their reward and what is the purpose of freedom from remorse what is its reward freedom from remorse has joy as its purpose joy as its reward and what is the purpose of joy what is its reward joy has rapture as its purpose rapture as its reward and what is the purpose of rapture what is its reward rapture has serenity as its purpose serenity as its reward and what is the purpose of serenity what is its reward serenity has pleasure as its purpose pleasure as its reward and what is the purpose of pleasure what is its reward pleasure has concentration as its purpose concentration as its reward and what is the purpose of concentration what is its reward concentration has knowledge vision of things as they actually are as its purpose knowledge vision of things as they actually are as its reward and what is the purpose of knowledge vision of things as

its reward disenchantment has dispassion as its purpose dispassion as its reward and what is the purpose of dispassion what is its reward dispassion has knowledge vision of release as its purpose knowledge vision of release as its reward thus in this way ananda skillful virtues have freedom from remorse as their purpose freedom from remorse as their reward freedom from remorse has joy as its purpose joy as its reward joy has rapture as its purpose rapture as its reward rapture has serenity as its purpose serenity as its reward serenity has pleasure as its purpose pleasure as its reward pleasure has concentration as its purpose concentration as its reward concentration has knowledge vision of things as they actually are as its purpose knowledge vision of things as they actually are as its reward knowledge vision of things as they actually are has disenchantment as its purpose disenchantment as its reward disenchantment has dispassion as its purpose dispassion as its reward dispassion has knowledge vision of release as its purpose knowledge vision of release as its reward in this way ananda skillful virtues lead step by step to the consummation of arahantship then now in terms of which five training rules is he restrained there is the case where a disciple of the noble ones abstains from taking life abstains from taking what is not given abstains from illicit sex

blessed one dwelled at rajagaha in the bamboo grove monastery at the squirrel s feeding place there a wandering ascetic moliya sivaka by name called on the blessed one and after an exchange of courteous and friendly words sat down at one side thus seated he said there are revered gotama some ascetics and brahmans who have this doctrine and view whatever a person experiences be it pleasure pain or neither pain nor pleasure all that is caused by previous action now what does the revered gotama say about this produced by disorders of the bile there arise sivaka certain kinds of feelings that this happens can be known by oneself also in the world it is accepted as true produced by disorders of the phlegm of wind of the three combined by change of climate by adverse behavior by injuries by the results of kamma through all that sivaka there arise certain kinds of feelings that this happens can be known by oneself also in the world it is accepted as true now when these ascetics and brahmans have such a doctrine and view that whatever a person experiences be it pleasure pain or neither pain nor pleasure all that is caused by previous action then they go beyond what they know by themselves and what is accepted as true by the world therefore i say that this is wrong on the part of these ascetics and brahmans on one occasion the blessed one was staying near yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said once in the past the devas asuras yes vepacitti let there be victory through what is well spoken so the devas asuras appointed a panel of judges thinking these will decide for us what is well spoken poorly spoken then vepacitti the asura king said to sakka the deva king say a verse deva king when this was said sakka the deva king said to vepacitti the asura king but you are the senior deity here vepacitti you say a verse when this was said vepacitti recited this verse fools would flare up even more if there were no constraints thus an enlightened one should restrain the fool with a heavy stick when vepacitti had said this verse the asuras applauded but the devas were silent so vepacitti said to sakka say a verse deva king when this was said sakka recited this verse this i think is the only constraint for a fool when knowing the other s provoked you mindfully grow calm when sakka had said this verse the devas applauded but the asuras were silent so sakka said to vepacitti say a verse vepacitti when this was said vepacitti recited this verse vasava when vepacitti had said this verse the asuras applauded but the devas were silent so vepacitti said to sakka say a verse deva king when this was said sakka recited this verse it doesn t matter whether he thinks he s forbearing out of fear of me one s own true good is the foremost good nothing better than patience is found whoever when strong is forbearing to one who is weak that s the foremost patience the weak must constantly endure they call that strength no strength at all whoever s strength is the strength of a fool there s no reproach for one who is strong guarding guarded by dhamma you make things worse when you flare up at someone who s angry whoever doesn t flare up at someone who s angry wins a battle hard to win you live for the good of both your own the other s when knowing the other s provoked you mindfully grow calm when you work the cure of both your own the other s those who think you a fool know nothing of dhamma when sakka had said this verse the devas applauded but the asuras were silent then the deva asura panel of judges said the verses said by vepacitti the asura king lie in the sphere of swords weapons thence arguments quarrels strife whereas the verses said by sakka the deva king lies outside the sphere of swords weapons thence no arguments no quarrels no strife the victory through what is well spoken goes to sakka the deva king and that monks is how the victory through what was well spoken went to sakka the deva king at savatthi then a certain monk went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one lord in such and such a dwelling a certain monk newly ordained not well known is diseased in pain severely ill it would be good if the blessed one would visit the monk out of sympathy for him then the blessed one on hearing the word newly ordained on hearing the word diseased and realizing that the monk was not well known went to him the monk saw the blessed one coming from afar and on seeing him stirred in his bed then the blessed one said to him enough monk don t stir in your bed there are these seats made ready i will sit down there the blessed one sat down on a seat made ready and said to the monk i hope you are getting better monk i hope you are comfortable i hope that your pains are lessening and not increasing i hope that there are signs of their lessening and not of their increasing i am not getting better lord i am not comfortable my extreme pains are increasing not lessening there are signs of their increasing and not of their lessening then i hope you have no anxiety monk i hope you have no anguish yes lord i do have not a small amount of anxiety not a small amount of anguish i hope you can t fault yourself with regard to your virtue no lord i can t fault myself with regard to my virtue then what are you anxious about what is your anguish i understand that the blessed one has not taught the dhamma with purity of virtue as its goal if you understand that i have not taught the dhamma with purity of virtue as its goal then for what goal do you understand that i have taught the dhamma i understand that the blessed one has taught the dhamma with total unbinding through lack of clinging as its goal good good monk it s good that you understand that i have taught the dhamma with total unbinding through lack of clinging as its goal for i what do you think monk is the eye constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord is the ear constant or inconstant inconstant lord is the nose constant or inconstant inconstant lord is the tongue constant or inconstant inconstant lord is the body constant or inconstant inconstant lord what do you think monk is the intellect constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with the eye disenchanted with the ear disenchanted with the nose disenchanted with the tongue disenchanted with the body disenchanted with the intellect disenchanted he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is fully released with full release there is the knowledge fully released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world that is what the blessed one said gratified the monk delighted in the blessed one s words and while this explanation was being given the mind of that monk through no clinging forms and sounds and flavors and smells and touches and all mental states are wished for cherished and pleasing as long as it s said that they re real for the world and for its devas these are equal to happiness whereas when they come to an end this for them is equal to pain happiness viewed by the nobles comes from restraining the ego this is just the opposite of how it is seen by all the world that which is pleasant for others for the noble ones is painful and what for others is painful the noble ones know as pleasant behold a teaching hard to know the deluded are confused here then a certain devata in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of jeta s grove went to the blessed one on arrival having bowed down to him she stood to one side as she was standing there she said to the blessed one these seven qualities lord lead to a monk s non decline which seven respect for the teacher respect for the dhamma respect for the sangha respect for training respect for concentration respect for heedfulness respect for hospitality these seven qualities lord lead to the non decline of a monk that is what the devata said the teacher approved sensing the teacher approves of me the devata bowed down to the blessed one and circled him three times keeping him to his right and then disappeared right there then when the night had past the blessed one addressed the monks last night monks a certain devata in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of jeta s grove came to me and on arrival bowed down to me and stood to one side as she was standing there she said to me these seven qualities lord lead to a monk s non decline which seven respect for the teacher respect for the dhamma respect for the sangha respect for training respect for concentration respect for heedfulness respect for hospitality these seven qualities lord lead to the non decline of a monk that is what that devata said having said it she bowed down to me circled me three times and then disappeared right there respecting the teacher respecting the dhamma and with fierce respect for the sangha respecting concentration ardent and with fierce respect for training a monk respecting heedfulness and with respect for hospitality incapable of decline is right in the presence of unbinding i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was living among the don t say that ananda don t say that admirable friendship admirable companionship admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life when a monk has admirable people as friends companions comrades he can be expected to develop pursue the noble eightfold path and through this line of reasoning one may know how admirable friendship admirable companionship admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life it is in dependence on me as an admirable friend that beings subject to birth have gained release from birth that beings subject to aging have gained release from aging that beings subject to death have gained release from death that beings subject to sorrow lamentation pain distress despair have gained release from sorrow lamentation pain distress despair it is through this line of reasoning that one may know how admirable friendship admirable companionship admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life without sign unknown the life here of mortals difficult short tied up with pain for there s no way by which those who are born will not die beings are subject to death even when they attain old age likeassee just asseeking on one occasion ven pindola bharadvaja was staying in the mind is unruly master bharadvaja sometimes thoughts of greed arise even for women who are old enough to be your mother your sister young enough to be your daughter is there another reason another cause why young monks without having played with sensual pleasures nevertheless follow the lifelong chaste life perfect pure and make it last their entire lives for those who are developed in body on hearing a sound with the ear on smelling an aroma with the nose on tasting a flavor with the tongue on feeling a tactile sensation with the body on cognizing an idea with the intellect do not grasp at any theme or variations by which if you were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail you practice with restraint guard the faculty of the intellect achieve restraint with regard to the faculty of the intellect this too is a reason this too is a cause great king why young monks black haired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life without having played with sensual pleasures nevertheless follow the lifelong chaste life perfect pure and make it last their entire lives amazing master bharadvaja stupendous how well that has been said by the blessed one who knows sees worthy and rightly self awakened this is the very reason this the very cause why young monks black haired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life without having played with sensual pleasures nevertheless follow the lifelong chaste life perfect pure and make it last their entire lives i myself master bharadvaja whenever i enter the inner apartments of the palace unguarded in body unguarded in speech unguarded in mind with mindfulness unestablished and my senses unrestrained i m overcome with thoughts of greed but whenever i enter the inner apartments of the palace guarded in body guarded in speech guarded in mind with mindfulness established and my senses restrained then i m not staying at savatthi then king ajatasattu of magadha the son of queen videha raising a fourfold army marched toward then in the early morning a large number of monks having put on their robes and carrying their bowls outer robes went into savatthi for alms having gone for alms in savatthi after the meal returning from their alms round they went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they said to the blessed one just now lord king ajatasattu of magadha the son of queen videha raising a fourfold army marched toward kasi against king pasenadi kosala king pasenadi heard king ajatasattu of magadha the son of queen videha they say has raised a fourfold army and is marching toward kasi against me so king pasenadi raising a fourfold army launched a counter attack toward kasi against king ajatasattu then king ajatasattu king pasenadi fought a battle and in that battle king ajatasattu defeated king pasenadi king pasenadi defeated marched back to his capital at savatthi monks king ajatasattu has evil friends evil comrades evil companions whereas king pasenadi has fine friends fine comrades fine companions yet for now king pasenadi will lie down tonight in pain defeated that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further winning gives birth to hostility losing one lies down in pain the calmed lie down with ease having set winning losing aside friend when a monk fully comprehends as they really are the arising and passing away of the six spheres of contact but that monk was dissatisfied with the other s answer so he went to another monk friend when a monk fully comprehends as they really are the arising and passing away of the five groups of clinging but that monk was dissatisfied with the other s answer and he went to another monk friend when a monk fully comprehends as they really are the arising and passing away of the four great elements but that monk was dissatisfied with the other s answer so he went to another monk friend when a monk fully comprehends as it really is that whatever is of a nature to arise is bound to pass away but that monk was dissatisfied with the other s answer and he went to the blessed one suppose monk a man had never seen a what s it tree so he went to someone who had seen one in the same way monk according to the way the vision of these wise monks it is monk just like some king s border city with strong walls and arches and with six gates and there is a wise skilled and experienced gatekeeper who keeps out the unknown and admits the known from the east there come a swift pair of messengers and they say to the gatekeeper where is the lord of this city he is over there sirs at the cross roads in the center then the two messengers take a truthful report to the lord of the city and return the way they came i have given you a parable monk and so that you can understand it this is the explanation the city is a name for the body composed of the four great elements born of mother and father an accumulation of rice and gruel impermanent subject to abrasion dissolution and disintegration the six gates denote the six internal sense spheres once the blessed one was staying at rajagaha in the bamboo grove near the squirrels feeding place now the brahman akkosa bharadvaja heard this the brahman bharadvaja it seems has become a monk under the great monk gotama angry and unhappy he went to where the blessed one was having approached the blessed one he abused and criticized the blessed one in foul and harsh words thus reviled the blessed one spoke to the brahman akkosa bharadvaja well brahman do friends confidants relatives kinsmen and guests visit you yes gotama sometimes friends confidants relatives kinsmen and guests do visit me well brahman do you not offer them snacks or food or tidbits yes gotama sometimes i do offer them snacks or food or tidbits but if brahman they do not accept it who gets it if gotama they do not accept it i get it back even so brahman you are abusing us who do not abuse you are angry with us who do not get angry you are quarreling with us who do not quarrel all this of yours we don t accept you alone brahman get it back all this brahman belongs to you when brahman one abuses back when abused repays anger in kind and quarrels back when quarreled with this is called brahman associating with each other and exchanging mutually this association and mutual exchange we do not engage in therefore you alone brahman get it back all this brahman belongs to you people including the king know the venerable gotama thus the monk gotama is the worthy one when does the venerable gotama become angry said the buddha where is anger for one freed from anger who is subdued and lives perfectly equanimous who truly knowing is wholly freed supremely tranquil and equipoised he who repays an angry man in kind is worse than the angry man who does not repay anger in kind he alone wins the battle hard to win he promotes the weal of both his own as well as of the other knowing that the other man is angry he mindfully maintains his peace and endures the anger of both his own as well as of the other even if the people ignorant of true wisdom consider him a fool thereby when the lord proclaimed this the brahman akkosa bharadvaja said this to the blessed one wonderful indeed o venerable gotama herewith i go to the venerable gotama for refuge to his teaching and to his holy order of monks most venerable sir may i have the privilege to receive at the hands of the revered lord gotama the initial monastic ordination and also the higher ordination of a bhikkhu and the brahman akkosa bharadvaja received at the hands of the blessed one the initial monastic ordination and he also received the higher ordination of a bhikkhu and within a short time of his ordination the venerable akkosa bharadvaja living alone secluded diligent zealous and unrelenting reached that incomparable consummation of holiness for which sons of noble families having totally abandoned the household life take to the life of homelessness with direct knowledge he realized the ultimate then and there and lived having access to it he saw with his supernormal vision ceased is rebirth lived is the holy life completed is the spiritual task and henceforth there is nothing higher to be achieved the venerable akkosa bharadvaja indeed became one of the arahats i have heard that on one occasion as the blessed one was wandering among the it s no inconvenience for me lord but there is a wanderer who has already taken up residence there if he gives his permission you may stay there as you like now at that time a clansman named the shed is roomy my friend stay as you like so the blessed one entering the potter s shed and setting out a spread of grass to one side sat down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore he spent most of the night sitting in meditation ven pukkusati also spent most of the night sitting in meditation the thought occurred to the blessed one how inspiring is the way this clansman behaves what if i were to question him so he said to ven pukkusati out of dedication to whom monk have you gone forth who is your teacher of whose dhamma do you approve there is my friend gotama the contemplative a son of the sakyans gone forth from a sakyan clan now this excellent report about the honorable gotama has been spread about indeed the blessed one is worthy rightly self awakened consummate in knowledge conduct well gone an expert with regard to the worlds unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the teacher of divine human beings awakened blessed i have gone forth out of dedication to that blessed one that blessed one is my teacher it is of that blessed one s dhamma that i approve but where monk is that blessed one worthy rightly self awakened staying now there is my friend a city in the northern lands named savatthi that is where the blessed one worthy rightly self awakened is staying now have you ever seen that blessed one before on seeing him would you recognize him no my friend i have never seen the blessed one before nor on seeing him would i recognize him then the thought occurred to the blessed one it is out of dedication to me that this clansman has gone forth what if i were to teach him the dhamma so he said to ven pukkusati i will teach you the dhamma monk listen pay close attention i will speak as you say friend replied ven pukkusati the blessed one said a person has six properties six media of sensory contact eighteen considerations four determinations he has been stilled where the currents of construing do not flow and when the currents of construing do not flow he is said to be a sage at peace one should not be negligent of discernment should guard the truth be devoted to relinquishment and train only for calm this is the summary of the analysis of the six properties a person has a person has a person has eighteen considerations thus was it said in reference to what was it said these are the eighteen considerations on seeing a form with the eye one considers a form that can act as a basis for joy a form that can act as a basis for distress or a form that can act as a basis for equanimity on hearing a sound with the ear on smelling an aroma with the nose on tasting a flavor with the tongue on feeling a tactile sensation with the body on cognizing an idea with the intellect one considers an idea that can act as a basis for joy an idea that can act as a basis for distress or an idea that can act as a basis for equanimity thus there are six considerations conducive to joy six conducive to distress six conducive to equanimity a person has eighteen considerations thus was it said and in reference to this was it said a person has one should not be negligent of discernment should guard the truth be devoted to relinquishment and train only for calm thus was it said in reference to what was it said and how is one not negligent of discernment these are the six properties the earth property the liquid property the fire property the wind property the space property the consciousness property and what is the earth property the earth property can be either internal or external what is the internal earth property anything internal within oneself that s hard solid sustained by craving head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver membranes spleen lungs large intestines small intestines contents of the stomach feces or anything else internal within oneself that s hard solid and sustained this is called the internal earth property now both the internal earth property the external earth property are simply earth property and that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment this is not mine this is not me this is not my self when one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the earth property and makes the earth property fade from the mind and what is the liquid property the liquid property may be either internal or external what is the internal liquid property anything internal belonging to oneself that s liquid watery sustained bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears oil saliva mucus oil of the joints urine or anything else internal within oneself that s liquid watery sustained this is called the internal liquid property now both the internal liquid property the external liquid property are simply liquid property and that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment this is not mine this is not me this is not my self when one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the liquid property and makes the liquid property fade from the mind and what is the fire property the fire property may be either internal or external what is the internal fire property anything internal belonging to oneself that s fire fiery sustained that by which the body is warmed aged consumed with fever and that by which what is eaten drunk consumed tasted gets properly digested or anything else internal within oneself that s fire fiery sustained this is called the internal fire property now both the internal fire property the external fire property are simply fire property and that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment this is not mine this is not me this is not my self when one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the fire property and makes the fire property fade from the mind and what is the wind property the wind property may be either internal or external what is the internal wind property anything internal belonging to oneself that s wind windy sustained up going winds down going winds winds in the stomach winds in the intestines winds that course through the body in and out breathing or anything else internal within oneself that s wind windy sustained this is called the internal wind property now both the internal wind property the external wind property are simply wind property and that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment this is not mine this is not me this is not my self when one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the wind property and makes the wind property fade from the mind and what is the space property the space property may be either internal or external what is the internal space property anything internal belonging to oneself that s space spatial sustained the holes of the ears the nostrils the mouth the passage whereby what is eaten drunk consumed tasted gets swallowed and where it collects and whereby it is excreted from below or anything else internal within oneself that s space spatial sustained this is called the internal space property now both the internal space property the external space property are simply space property and that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment this is not mine this is not me this is not my self when one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the space property and makes the space property fade from the mind there remains only consciousness pure bright what does one cognize with that consciousness one cognizes pleasure one cognizes pain one cognizes neither pleasure nor pain in dependence on a sensory contact that is to be felt as pleasure there arises a feeling of pleasure when sensing a feeling of pleasure one discerns that i am sensing a feeling of pleasure one discerns that with the cessation of that very sensory contact that is to be felt as pleasure the concomitant feeling the feeling of pleasure that has arisen in dependence on the sensory contact that is to be felt as pleasure ceases is stilled in dependence on a sensory contact that is to be felt as pain in dependence on a sensory contact that is to be felt as neither pleasure nor pain there arises a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain when sensing a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain one discerns that i am sensing a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain one discerns that with the cessation of that very sensory contact that is to be felt as neither pleasure nor pain the concomitant feeling the feeling of neither pleasure nor pain that has arisen in dependence on the sensory contact that is to be felt as neither pleasure nor pain ceases is stilled just as when from the friction conjunction of two fire sticks heat is born and fire appears and from the separation disjunction of those very same fire sticks the concomitant heat ceases is stilled in the same way in dependence on a sensory contact that is to be felt as pleasure there arises a feeling of pleasure in dependence on a sensory contact that is to be felt as pain in dependence on a sensory contact that is to be felt as neither pleasure nor pain there arises a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain one discerns that with the cessation of that very sensory contact that is to be felt as neither pleasure nor pain the concomitant feeling ceases is stilled there remains only equanimity pure bright pliant malleable luminous just as if a skilled goldsmith or goldsmith s apprentice were to prepare a furnace heat up a crucible and taking gold with a pair of tongs place it in the crucible he would blow on it time again sprinkle water on it time again examine it time again so that the gold would become refined well refined thoroughly refined flawless free from dross pliant malleable luminous then whatever sort of ornament he had in mind whether a belt an earring a necklace or a gold chain it would serve his purpose in the same way there remains only equanimity pure bright pliant malleable luminous one discerns that if i were to direct equanimity as pure bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of space i would develop the mind along those lines and thus this equanimity of mine thus supported thus sustained would last for a long time one discerns that if i were to direct equanimity as pure and bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor non perception i would develop the mind along those lines and thus this equanimity of mine thus supported thus sustained would last for a long time one discerns that if i were to direct equanimity as pure bright as this towards the dimension of the infinitude of space and to develop the mind along those lines that would be fabricated one discerns that if i were to direct equanimity as pure and bright as this towards the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor non perception and to develop the mind along those lines that would be fabricated one neither fabricates nor mentally fashions for the sake of becoming or un becoming this being the case one is not sustained by anything in the world does not cling to anything in the world unsustained one is not agitated unagitated one is totally unbound right within one discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world sensing a feeling of pleasure one discerns that it is fleeting not grasped at not relished sensing a feeling of pain sensing a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain one discerns that it is fleeting not grasped at not relished sensing a feeling of pleasure one senses it disjoined from it sensing a feeling of pain sensing a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain one senses it disjoined from it when sensing a feeling limited to the body one discerns that i am sensing a feeling limited to the body when sensing a feeling limited to life one discerns that i am sensing a feeling limited to life one discerns that with the break up of the body after the termination of life all that is sensed not being relished will grow cold right here just as an oil lamp burns in dependence on oil wick and from the termination of the oil wick and from not being provided any other sustenance it goes out unnourished even so when sensing a feeling limited to the body one discerns that i am sensing a feeling limited to the body when sensing a feeling limited to life one discerns that i am sensing a feeling limited to life one discerns that with the break up of the body after the termination of life all that is sensed not being relished will grow cold right here thus a monk so endowed is endowed with the highest determination for discernment for this the knowledge of the passing away of all suffering stress is the highest noble discernment his release being founded on truth does not fluctuate for whatever is deceptive is false unbinding the undeceptive is true thus a monk so endowed is endowed with the highest determination for truth for this unbinding the undeceptive is the highest noble truth whereas formerly he foolishly had taken on mental acquisitions and brought them to completion he has now abandoned them their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising thus a monk so endowed is endowed with the highest determination for relinquishment for this the renunciation of all mental acquisitions is the highest noble relinquishment whereas formerly he foolishly had greed as well as desire infatuation he has now abandoned them their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising whereas formerly he foolishly had malice as well as ill will hatred he has now abandoned them whereas formerly he foolishly had ignorance as well as delusion confusion he has now abandoned them their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising thus a monk so endowed is endowed with the highest determination for calm for this the calming of passions aversions delusions is the highest noble calm one should not be negligent of discernment should guard the truth be devoted to relinquishment and train only for calm thus was it said and in reference to this was it said he has been stilled where the currents of construing do not flow and when the currents of construing do not flow he is said to be a sage at peace thus was it said with reference to what was it said i am is a construing i am this is a construing i shall be is a construing i shall not be i shall be possessed of form i shall not be possessed of form i shall be percipient i shall not be percipient i shall be neither percipient nor non percipient is a construing construing is a disease construing is a cancer construing is an arrow by going beyond all construing he is said to be a sage at peace furthermore a sage at peace is not born does not age does not die is unagitated and is free from longing he has nothing whereby he would be born not being born will he age not aging will he die not dying will he be agitated not being agitated for what will he long it was in reference to this that it was said he has been stilled where the currents of construing do not flow and when the currents of construing do not flow he is said to be a sage at peace now monk you should remember this my brief analysis of the six properties then the thought occurred to ven pukkusati surely the teacher has come to me surely the one well gone has come to me surely the rightly self awakened one has come to me getting up from his seat arranging his upper robe over one shoulder and bowing down with his head at the blessed one s feet he said a transgression has overcome me lord in that i was so foolish so muddle headed and so unskilled as to assume that it was proper to address the blessed one as friend may the blessed one please accept this confession of my transgression as such so that i may achieve restraint in the future yes monk a transgression overcame you in that you were so foolish so muddle headed and so unskilled as to assume that it was proper to address me as friend but because you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the dhamma we accept your confession for it is a cause of growth in the dhamma discipline of the noble ones when seeing a transgression as such one makes amends in accordance with the dhamma and achieves restraint in the future lord may i receive full acceptance ordination as a monk from the blessed one and are your robes bowl complete no lord my robes bowl are not complete tathagatas do not give full acceptance to one whose robes bowl are not complete then a large number of monks approached the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they said to the blessed one lord the clansman pukkusati whom the blessed one instructed with a brief instruction has died what is his destination what is his future state monks the clansman pukkusati was wise he practiced the dhamma in accordance with the dhamma and did not pester me with issues related to the dhamma with the destruction of the first five fetters he has arisen spontaneously in the pure abodes there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words on one occasion i am a monk my friend which kind of monk a son of the sakyan contemplative i would like to ask you about a certain point if you would give me leave to pose a question go ahead and ask having heard your question i ll inform you how is it my friend no my friend i don t have that sort of view very well then no my friend i don t have that sort of view very well then no my friend i don t have that sort of view then in that case do you not know or see no my friend it s not the case that i don t know i don t see i do know i do see but on being asked how is it my friend what is your name my friend what do your fellows in the chaste life call you my name is ananda my friend and that s what my fellows in the chaste life call me what have i been talking with the great teacher without realizing that it was ven ananda had i recognized that it was ven ananda i would not have cross examined him so much may ven ananda please forgive me thus have i heard once the blessed one was wandering among the what do you think monks which would in fact be the better embracing that great mass of fire burning blazing glowing and sitting or lying down close to it or embracing a kshatriya or brahman or householder woman with young and tender hands and feet and sitting or lying down close to her this venerable sir would surely be the better embracing a kshatriya or brahman or householder woman with young and tender hands and feet and sitting or lying down close to her for it would be painful venerable sir to embrace that great burning blazing glowing mass of fire and sit or lie down close to it let me tell you monks let me explain to you monks that this would surely be the better for one who is of poor conduct an evil minded one a filthy doer of complete wickedness who acts in an underhand manner who pretends to be a recluse yet is not a recluse who pretends to lead the holy life yet does not lead the holy life an inwardly putrid impure natured one embracing that great mass of fire burning blazing glowing and sitting or lying down close to it what is the reason for this because on account of that monks he would go to death or to a pain like that of death but he would not on account of that on the break up of the body after death be reborn into a place of woe a realm of misery a place of suffering a purgatory but monks if one who is of poor conduct an evil minded one a filthy doer of complete wickedness who acts in an underhand manner who pretends to be a recluse yet is not a recluse who pretends to lead the holy life yet does not lead the holy life an inwardly putrid impure natured one were to embrace a kshatriya or brahman or householder woman with young and tender hands and feet and sit or lie down close to her for him monks there would be a long period of harm and suffering and on the break up of the body after death he would be reborn into a place of woe a realm of misery a place of suffering a purgatory what do you think monks which would in fact be the better if a strong man having twisted a firm horse hair rope around both calves were to rub so that the rope cut the skin and having cut the skin it cut the under skin and having cut the under skin it cut the flesh and having cut the flesh it cut the sinew and having cut the sinew it cut the bone and having cut the bone it left the marrow exposed or to derive enjoyment from the homage of rich kshatriyas or rich brahmans or rich householders this venerable sir is surely the better to derive enjoyment from the homage of rich kshatriyas or rich brahmans or rich householders for it would be painful venerable sir if a strong man having twisted a firm hair rope around both calves were to rub so that the rope cut the skin and so on until it left the marrow exposed let me tell you monks let me explain to you monks that this would surely be the better for one who is of poor conduct an impure natured one if a strong man having twisted a firm horse hair rope around both calves were to rub so that the rope cut the skin and so on until it left the marrow exposed what is the reason for this because on account of that monks he would go to death or to a pain like that of death but on account of that he would not on the break up of the body after death be reborn into a place of woe a realm of misery a place of suffering a purgatory but monks if one who is of poor conduct an evil minded one a filthy doer of complete wickedness an impure natured one were to derive enjoyment from the homage of rich kshatriyas or rich brahmans or rich householders for him monks there would be a long period of harm and suffering and on the break up of the body after death he would be reborn into a place of woe a realm of misery a place of suffering a purgatory what do you think monks which would in fact be the better if a strong man were to strike the nether quarters with a sharp oil cleaned sword or to derive enjoyment when rich kshatriyas brahmans or householders press the palms together in prayer let me tell you monks let me explain to you that this would surely be the better for one who is of poor conduct an impure natured one if a strong man were to strike the nether quarters with a sharp oil cleaned sword what do you think monks which would in fact be the better if a strong man were to wrap the body with a red hot sheet of iron burning blazing glowing or to derive enjoyment from the robes given in faith by rich kshatriyas brahmans or householders let me tell you monks let me explain to you that this would surely be the better for one who is of poor conduct an impure natured one if a strong man were to wrap the body with a red hot sheet of iron what do you think monks which would in fact be the better if a strong man having opened the mouth with a red hot iron spike were to hurl into the mouth a red hot iron ball burning blazing glowing so that one s lips would burn then the mouth would burn then the tongue would burn then the throat would burn then the chest would burn and when it was received by the lower intestine it would be expelled from the lower part of the body or to derive enjoyment from the food received on alms round and given in faith by rich kshatriyas brahmans or householders let me tell you monks let me explain to you that this would surely be the better for one who is of poor conduct an impure natured one if a strong man having opened the mouth with a red hot iron spike were to hurl into the mouth a red hot iron ball what do you think monks which would in fact be the better if a strong man having gripped the head or shoulder were to force one sit or lie on a red hot iron bed or chair or to derive enjoyment from a chair given in faith by rich kshatriyas or brahmans or householders let me tell you monks let me explain to you that this would surely be the better for one who is of poor conduct an impure natured one if a strong man having gripped the head or shoulder were to force one sit or lie on a red hot iron bed or chair what do you think monks which would in fact be the better if a strong man having gripped one heels up head down were to force one down into a red hot iron cauldron burning blazing glowing and where there is boiling scum on top he were to go once up once down and then once sideways or to derive enjoyment from an abode given in faith by rich kshatriyas or brahmans or householders let me tell you monks let me explain to you that this would surely be the better for one who is of poor conduct an impure natured one if a strong man having gripped one heels up head down were to force one down into a red hot iron cauldron because of what i have said here monks you should train yourselves such that the gifts of those whose thus spoke the blessed one and while this explanation was being delivered hot blood rose out of the mouths of sixty monks another sixty monks abandoned the training and returned to the lower life saying it is too difficult to do blessed one it is too difficult to do while the minds of another sixty monks abandoned clinging and were liberated from the at savatthi monks form is inconstant changeable alterable feeling perception fabrications consciousness is inconstant changeable alterable one who has conviction belief that these phenomena are this way is called a faith follower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the run of the mill he is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry shades he is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry one who after pondering with a modicum of discernment has accepted that these phenomena are this way is called a dhamma follower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the run of the mill he is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry shades he is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry one who knows and sees that these phenomena are this way is called a stream enterer steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for self awakening one should not do much work one should avoid people one should not bustle to obtain gifts one who is eager and greedy for flavors misses the goal that entails happiness they knew as a bog this homage and veneration obtained among devoted families a subtle dart difficult to extract honor is hard for a vile man to discard it is not on account of another that a mortal s kamma is evil on one s own accord one should not resort to evil for mortals have kamma as their kinsmen one is not a thief by another s word one is not a sage by another s word it is as one knows oneself that the devas also know one others do not understand that we all come to an end here but those wise ones who understand this thereby settle their quarrels the wise man lives indeed even despite the loss of his wealth but if one does not obtain wisdom then even though rich one is not alive one hears all with the ear one sees all with the eye the wise man should not reject everything that is seen and heard one with eyes should be as if blind one with ears as if deaf one with wisdom as if mute one with strength as if feeble then when the goal has been attained one may lie upon one s death bed endowed with five qualities a monk pursuing mindfulness of breathing will in no long time penetrate the unprovoked release which five he is a person who imposes only a little on others one of few duties projects easy to support easily contented with the requisites of life he is a person who eats only a little food committed to not indulging his stomach he is a person of only a little sloth committed to wakefulness he lives in the wilderness in an isolated dwelling place he reflects on the mind as it is released endowed with these five qualities a monk pursuing mindfulness of breathing will in no long time penetrate the unprovoked on one occasion the blessed one was staying at yes lord the monks replied to the blessed one the blessed one said these five are obstacles hindrances that overwhelm awareness and weaken discernment which five sensual desire is an obstacle a hindrance that overwhelms awareness and weakens discernment ill will sloth drowsiness restlessness anxiety uncertainty is an obstacle a hindrance that overwhelms awareness and weakens discernment these are the five obstacles hindrances that overwhelm awareness and weaken discernment and when a monk has not abandoned these five obstacles hindrances that overwhelm awareness and weaken discernment when he is without strength and weak in discernment for him to understand what is for his own benefit to understand what is for the benefit of others to understand what is for the benefit of both to realize a superior human state a truly noble distinction in knowledge vision that is impossible now when a monk has abandoned these five obstacles hindrances that overwhelm awareness and weaken discernment when he is strong in discernment for him to understand what is for his own benefit to understand what is for the benefit of others to understand what is for the benefit of both to realize a superior human state a truly noble distinction in knowledge vision that is possible suppose there were a river flowing down from the mountains going far its current swift carrying everything with it and a man would close the channels leading away from it on both sides so that the current in the middle of the river would be undispersed undiffused undissipated it would go far its current swift carrying everything with it in the same way when a monk has abandoned these five obstacles hindrances that overwhelm awareness and weaken discernment when he is strong in discernment for him to understand what is for his own benefit to understand what is for the benefit of others to understand what is for the benefit of both to realize a superior human state a truly noble distinction in knowledge vision that is possible one portion was enjoyed by the king along with his household of women one portion was enjoyed by the army one portion was enjoyed by the people of the town and village one portion was enjoyed by brahmans and ascetics and one portion was enjoyed by the beasts and birds nobody guarded the fruits of that royal tree and neither did anyone harm one another for the sake of its fruits but then a certain man came along who fed upon as much of steadfast s fruits as he wanted broke off a branch and wandered on his way and the deva who dwelled in steadfast thought to herself it is astonishing it is truly amazing that such an evil man would dare to feed upon as much of steadfast s fruits as he wants break off a branch and then wander on his way now what if steadfast were in the future to bear no more fruit and so the royal fig tree steadfast bore no more fruit so then king koravya went up to where sakka chief among the gods was dwelling and having approached said this surely you must know sire that steadfast the royal fig tree no longer bears fruit and then sakka created a magical creation of such a form that a mighty wind and rain came down and toppled the royal fig tree steadfast uprooting it entirely and then the deva who dwelled in steadfast grieved lamented and stood weeping on one side with a face full of tears and then sakka chief among the gods went up to where the deva was standing and having approached said this why is it deva that you grieve and lament and stand on one side with a face full of tears it is because sire a mighty wind and rain has come and toppled my abode uprooting it entirely and were you deva upholding the dhamma of trees when this happened but how is it sire that a tree upholds the dhamma of trees like this deva root cutters take the root of the tree bark strippers take the bark leaf pickers take the leaves flower pickers take the flowers fruit pickers take the fruits and none of this is reason enough for a deva to think only of herself or become morose thus it is deva that a tree upholds the dhamma of trees then indeed sire i was not upholding the dhamma of trees when the mighty wind and rain came and toppled my abode uprooting it entirely if it were the case deva that you were to uphold the dhamma of trees it may be that your abode might be as it was before i will indeed sire uphold the dhamma of trees may my abode be as it was before and then sakka chief among the gods created a magical creation of such a form that a mighty wind and rain came down and raised up the royal fig tree steadfast and its roots were entirely healed at savatthi there are o monks four nutriments for the sustenance of beings born and for the support of beings seeking birth what are the four edible food coarse and fine sense impression is the second volitional thought the third and consciousness the fourth if o monks there is lust for the nutriment edible food if there is pleasure in it and craving for it then consciousness if o monks there is lust for the nutriment sense impression volitional thought consciousness if there is pleasure in it and craving for it then consciousness takes a hold therein and grows where consciousness takes a hold and grows there will be occurrence of mind and body where there is occurrence of mind and body there is growth of kamma formations where there is growth of kamma formations there is a future arising of renewed existence where there is a future arising of renewed existence there is future birth decay and death this i say o monks is laden with sorrow burdened with anguish and despair suppose there is a dyer or a painter having some dye or lac yellow turmeric blue indigo or crimson he would depict on a well smoothed wooden tablet on a wall or a piece of cloth the figure of a woman or a man with all the major and minor features of the body similarly o monks if there is lust for the nutriments edible food sense impression volitional thought and consciousness then consciousness takes a hold therein and grows where consciousness takes a hold and grows there is occurrence of mind and body where there is occurrence of mind and body there is growth of kamma formations where there is growth of kamma formations there is a future arising of renewed existence where there is a future arising of renewed existence there is future birth decay and death this i say o monks is laden with sorrow burdened with anguish and despair but if o monks there is no lust for the nutriments edible food sense impression volitional thought and consciousness if there is no pleasure in them and no craving for them then consciousness does not take a hold therein and does not grow where consciousness does not take a hold nor grow there will be no occurrence of mind and body where there is no occurrence of mind and body there is no growth of kamma formations where there is no growth of kamma formations there is no future arising of renewed existence where there is no future arising of renewed existence there is no future birth decay and death this i say o monks is free of sorrow of anguish and despair suppose o monks there is a gabled house or a gabled hall with windows at the northern southern and eastern sides now when at sunrise a ray of the sun enters through a window where would it find hold on the western wall o lord but if there were no western wall o monks where would it find a hold on the earth o lord and if there were no earth where would it find a hold on the water similarly o monks if there is no lust for the nutriments edible food sense impression volitional thought and consciousness if there is no pleasure in them and no craving for them then consciousness does not take hold therein and does not grow where consciousness does not take a hold nor grow there will be no occurrence of mind and body there is no growth of kamma formations where there is no growth of kamma formations there is no future arising of renewed existence where there is no future arising of renewed existence there is no future birth decay and death this i say o monks is free of sorrow of anguish and despair endowed with these six qualities a person is incapable of alighting on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities even when listening to the true dhamma which six he has killed his mother he has killed his father he has killed an arahant he has with corrupt intent caused the blood of a tathagata to flow he has caused a split in the sangha endowed with these six qualities a person is incapable of alighting on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities even when listening to the true dhamma endowed with these six qualities

endowed with these six qualities a person is capable of alighting on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities even while listening to the true dhamma now this noble eightfold path is to be developed for direct knowledge of comprehension of the total ending of the abandoning of these four floods which noble eightfold path there is the case where a monk develops right view dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in letting go he develops right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in letting go this noble eightfold path is to be developed for direct knowledge of for comprehension of for the total ending of for the abandoning of these four floods in a guest house o monks people from the east may take lodgings or people from the west north or south people from the warrior caste may come and take lodgings there and also brahmans middle class people and menials similarly o monks there arise in this body various kinds of feelings there arise pleasant feelings painful feelings and neutral feelings worldly feelings that are pleasant painful or neutral and unworldly monks when an uninstructed run of the mill person makes the statement there is a bottomless chasm in the ocean he is talking about something that doesn t exist that can t be found the word bottomless chasm is actually a designation for painful bodily feeling when an uninstructed run of the mill person is touched by a painful bodily feeling he sorrows grieves laments beats his breast becomes distraught this is called an uninstructed run of the mill person who has not risen up out of the bottomless chasm who has not gained a foothold when a well instructed disciple of the noble ones is touched by a painful bodily feeling he does not sorrow grieve or lament does not beat his breast or become distraught this is called a well instructed disciple of the noble ones who has risen up out of the bottomless chasm whose foothold is gained whoever can t endure them once they ve arisen painful bodily feelings that could kill living beings who trembles at their touch who cries wails a weakling with no resilience he hasn t risen up out of the bottomless chasm or even gained a foothold whoever endures them once they ve arisen painful bodily feelings that could kill living beings who doesn t tremble at their touch he s risen up out of the bottomless chasm his foothold is gained i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near sir i have come here from the presence of gotama the contemplative and what does a wise person think about gotama the contemplative s acuity of discernment sir who am i to know gotama the contemplative s acuity of discernment wouldn t one have to be his equal to know his acuity of discernment master vacchayana praises gotama the contemplative with lavish praise indeed sir who am i to praise gotama the contemplative he is praised by the praised as the best of beings human divine seeing what reasons does master vacchayana have such high confidence in gotama the contemplative sir suppose an elephant hunter were to enter an elephant forest and were to see there a large elephant footprint long in extent and broad in width he would come to the conclusion what a big bull elephant in the same way when i saw four footprints in gotama the contemplative i came to the conclusion the blessed one is rightly self awakened the dhamma is well taught by the blessed one the sangha of the blessed one s disciples has practiced rightly which four there is the case where i see certain noble warriors who are pundits subtle skilled in debate like hair splitting marksmen they prowl about as it were shooting philosophical positions to pieces with their dialectic they hear gotama the contemplative they say will visit that village or town they formulate a question thus having gone to gotama the contemplative we will ask him this question of ours if having been asked like this he answers like this we will refute his teaching like this and if having been asked like this he answers like that we will refute his teaching like that they hear gotama the contemplative is visiting that village or town they go to him and he instructs urges rouses encourages them with a talk on dhamma having been instructed urged roused encouraged by him with a talk on dhamma they don t even ask him their question so since when could they refute him as it turns out they become his disciples when i saw this first footprint in gotama the contemplative i came to the conclusion the blessed one is rightly self awakened the dhamma is well taught by the blessed one the sangha of the blessed one s disciples has practiced rightly then there is the case where i see certain brahmans then there is the case where i see certain householders then there is the case where i see certain contemplatives who are pundits subtle skilled in debate like hair splitting marksmen they prowl about as it were shooting philosophical positions to pieces with their dialectic they hear gotama the contemplative they say will visit that village or town they formulate a question thus having gone to gotama the contemplative we will ask him this question of ours if having been asked like this he answers like this we will refute his teaching like this and if having been asked like this he answers like that we will refute his teaching like that they hear gotama the contemplative is visiting that village or town they go to him and he instructs urges rouses encourages them with a talk on dhamma having been instructed urged roused encouraged by him with a talk on dhamma they don t even ask him their question so since when could they refute him as it turns out they ask him for the opportunity to go forth from the home life into homelessness he gives them the going forth having gone forth there dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent resolute they in no long time reach remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing realizing it for themselves in the here now they say how near we were to being lost how near we were to being lost before though we weren t contemplatives we claimed to be contemplatives though we weren t brahmans we claimed to be brahmans though we weren t arahants we claimed to be arahants but now we when i saw this fourth footprint in gotama the contemplative i came to the conclusion the blessed one is rightly self awakened the dhamma is well taught by the blessed one the sangha of the blessed one s disciples has practiced rightly when this was said janussonin the brahman got down from his totally white roofed chariot and arranging his upper robe over one shoulder and extending his hands in reverent salutation in the direction of the blessed one exclaimed this exclamation three times homage to the blessed one worthy rightly self awakened homage to the blessed one worthy rightly self awakened homage to the blessed one worthy rightly self awakened may i at some time or another meet with master gotama may there be some conversation then janussonin the brahman went to the blessed one and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he told the blessed one the entirety of his conversation with pilotika the wanderer when he was finished the blessed one said to him it s not to that extent brahman that the elephant footprint simile is complete in its details as to how it as you say sir janussonin the brahman responded the blessed one said suppose an elephant hunter were to enter an elephant forest and were to see there a large elephant footprint long in extent and broad in width a skilled elephant hunter would not yet come to the conclusion what a big bull elephant why is that because in an elephant forest there are dwarf female elephants with big feet the footprint might be one of theirs so he follows along and sees in the elephant forest a large elephant footprint long in extent and broad in width and some scratch marks high up a skilled elephant hunter would not yet come to the conclusion what a big bull elephant why is that because in an elephant forest there are tall female elephants with prominent teeth big feet the footprint might be one of theirs so he follows along and sees in the elephant forest a large elephant footprint long in extent and broad in width with some scratch marks and tusk slashes high up a skilled elephant hunter would not yet come to the conclusion what a big bull elephant why is that because in an elephant forest there are tall female elephants with tusks big feet the footprint might be one of theirs so he follows along and sees in the elephant forest a large elephant footprint long in extent and broad in width with some scratch marks and tusk slashes high up and some broken off branches and he sees that bull elephant at the foot of the tree or in an open clearing walking standing sitting or lying down he comes to the conclusion that s the big bull elephant in the same way brahman there is the case where a tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly self awakened he teaches the dhamma admirable in its beginning admirable in its middle admirable in its end he proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure a householder or householder s son hearing the dhamma gains conviction in the tathagata and reflects household life is confining a dusty path life gone forth is the open air it isn t easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shell what if i having shaved off my hair beard and putting on the ochre robe were to go forth from the household life into homelessness so after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of relatives large or small shaves off his hair and beard puts on the ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into

s consummation in virtue furthermore the virtuous person consummate in virtue on the break up of the body after death reappears in a good destination a heavenly world this is the fifth reward coming from a virtuous person s consummation in virtue these householders are the five rewards coming from a virtuous person s consummation in virtue then the blessed one having instructed urged roused encouraged the lay followers of p ali village for a large part of the night with dhamma talk dismissed them saying the night is far gone householders do what you think it is now time to do so the lay followers of p ali village delighting in approving of the blessed one s words got up from their seats bowed down to him and left circling him to the right then the blessed one not long after they had left entered an empty building now on that occasion sun dha vassak ra the chief ministers of magadha were building a city at p ali village to preempt the vajjians and on that occasion many devas by the thousands were occupying sites in p ali village in the area where devas of great influence occupied sites there the minds of the king s royal ministers of great influence were inclined to build their homes in the area where devas of middling influence occupied sites there the minds of the king s royal ministers of middling influence were inclined to build their homes in the area where devas of low influence occupied sites there the minds of the king s royal ministers of low influence were inclined to build their homes the blessed one with the divine eye purified and surpassing the human saw many devas by the thousands occupying sites in p ali village in the area where devas of great influence occupied sites there the minds of the king s royal ministers of great influence were inclined to build their homes in the area where devas of middling influence occupied sites there the minds of the king s royal ministers of middling influence were inclined to build their homes in the area where devas of low influence occupied sites there the minds of the king s royal ministers of low influence were inclined to build their homes then getting up in the last watch of the night the blessed one addressed ven nanda nanda who is building a city at p ali village sun dha vassak ra the chief ministers of magadha lord are building a city at p ali village to preempt the vajjians nanda it s as if they had consulted the devas of the thirty three that s how sun dha vassak ra the chief ministers of magadha are building a city at p ali village to preempt the vajjians just now nanda with the divine eye purified and surpassing the human i saw many devas by the thousands occupying sites in p ali village in the area where devas of great influence occupy sites there the minds of the king s royal ministers of great influence are inclined to build their homes in the area where devas of middling influence occupy sites there the minds of the king s royal ministers of middling influence are inclined to build their homes in the area where devas of low influence occupy sites there the minds of the king s royal ministers of low influence are inclined to build their homes nanda as far as the sphere of the ariyans extends as far as merchants roads extend this will be the supreme city p aliputta then sun dha vassak ra the chief ministers of magadha went to the blessed one and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies they stood to one side as they were standing there they said to him may master gotama acquiesce to our meal today together with the community of monks the blessed one acquiesced with silence then sun dha vassak ra the chief ministers of magadha understanding the blessed one s acquiescence went to their rest house on arrival after having exquisite staple non staple food prepared in their rest house they announced the time to the blessed one it s time master gotama the meal is ready then the blessed one early in the morning adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl robes went together with the community of monks to the rest house of sun dha vassak ra the chief ministers of magadha on arrival he sat down on the seat laid out sun dha vassak ra with their own hands served satisfied the community of monks with the buddha at its head with exquisite staple non staple food then when the blessed one had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl sun dha vassak ra taking a low seat sat to one side as they were sitting there the blessed one gave his approval with these verses in whatever place a wise person makes his dwelling there providing food for the virtuous the restrained leaders of the holy life he should dedicate that offering to the devas there they receiving honor will honor him being respected will show him respect as a result they will feel sympathy for him like that of a mother for her child her son a person with whom the devas sympathize always meets with auspicious things then the blessed one having given his approval to sun dha vassak ra with these verses got up from his seat and left and on that occasion sun dha vassak ra followed right after the blessed one thinking by whichever gate gotama the contemplative departs today that will be called the gotama gate and by whichever ford he crosses over the ganges river that will be called the gotama ford so the gate by which the blessed one departed was called the gotama gate then he went to the ganges river now on that occasion the ganges river was full up to the banks so that a crow could drink from it some people were searching for boats some were searching for floats some were binding rafts in hopes of going from this shore to the other so the blessed one just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm disappeared from the near bank of the ganges river and reappeared on the far bank together with the community of monks he saw that some people were searching for boats some were searching for floats some were binding rafts in hopes of going from this shore to the other then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed those who cross the foaming flood having made a bridge avoiding the swamps while people are binding rafts have already crossed the wise see also then vacchagotta the wanderer went to ven maha moggallana and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to ven maha moggallana now then master moggallana is the cosmos eternal that has not been declared by the blessed one vaccha the cosmos is eternal well then master moggallana is the cosmos not eternal vaccha that too has not been declared by the blessed one the cosmos is not eternal then is the cosmos finite is the cosmos infinite is the body the same as the soul is the body one thing and the soul another does the tathagata exist after death does the tathagata not exist after death does the tathagata both exist and not exist after death does the tathagata neither exist nor not exist after death vaccha that too has not been declared by the blessed one the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death now master moggallana what is the cause what is the reason why when wanderers of other sects are asked in this way they answer that the cosmos is eternal or the cosmos is not eternal or the cosmos is finite or the cosmos is infinite or the body is the same as the soul or the body is one thing and the soul another or the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death yet when gotama the contemplative is asked in this way he does not answer that the cosmos is eternal or the cosmos is not eternal or the cosmos is finite or the cosmos is infinite or the body is the same as the soul or the body is one thing and the soul another or the tathagata exists after death or the tathagata does not exist after death or the tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death vaccha the members of other sects assume of the eye that this is mine this is my self this is what i am they assume of the ear the nose the tongue the body the intellect that this is mine this is my self this is what i am that is why when asked in this way they answer that the cosmos is eternal or that the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death but the tathagata worthy and rightly self awakened does not assume of the eye that this is mine this is my self this is what i am he does not assume of the ear the nose the tongue the body the intellect that this is mine this is my self this is what i am that is why when asked in this way he does not answer that the cosmos is eternal or that the tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death then vacchagotta the wanderer getting up from his seat went to the blessed one and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he addressed the same questions to the blessed one and received exactly the same explanation amazing master gotama astounding how the meaning and phrasing of the teacher and disciple agree coincide and do not diverge from one another with regard to the supreme teaching just now master gotama i went to the contemplative moggallana and on arrival asked him about this matter and he answered me with the same words the same phrasing as master gotama amazing master gotama astounding how the meaning and phrasing of the teacher and disciple agree coincide and do not diverge from one another with regard to the supreme teaching i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near when a house is on fire the vessel salvaged is the one that will be of use not the one left there to burn so when the world is on fire with aging and death one should salvage one s wealth by giving what s given is well salvaged what s given bears fruit as pleasure what isn t given does not thieves take it away or kings it gets burnt by fire or lost then in the end one leaves the body together with one s possessions knowing this the intelligent man enjoys possessions gives having enjoyed given in line with his means uncensured he goes to the heavenly state i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was on a wandering tour among the then lohicca heard it said gotama the contemplative the son of the sakyans having gone forth from the sakyan clan on a wandering tour among the kosalans with a large community of monks approximately monks in all has arrived at salavatika and of that master gotama this fine reputation has spread he is indeed a blessed one worthy rightly self awakened consummate in knowledge conduct well gone a knower of the cosmos an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed teacher of human divine beings awakened blessed he has made known having realized it through direct knowledge this world with its devas maras brahmas its generations with their contemplatives brahmans their rulers common people has explained the dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end has expounded the holy life both in its particulars in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure it is good to see such a worthy one so lohicca said to responding as you say sir to the brahman lohicca rosika the barber went to the blessed one and on arrival bowing down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one the brahman lohicca lord asks whether the blessed one is free from illness affliction is carefree strong living in comfort and he says may the blessed one together with the community of monks consent to tomorrow s meal with the brahman lohicca the blessed one consented through silence then rosika the barber understanding the blessed one s consent rose from his seat bowed down to the blessed one circumambulated him keeping him to his right and returned to the brahman lohicca on arrival he said to him i have informed the blessed one of your words saying the brahman lohicca lord asks whether the blessed one is free from illness affliction is carefree strong living in comfort and he says may the blessed one together with the community of monks consent to tomorrow s meal with the brahman lohicca and the blessed one has consented then as the night was ending the brahman lohicca had choice staple non staple foods prepared in his own home and then said to rosika the barber come dear rosika go to gotama the contemplative and on arrival announce the time saying it is time master gotama the meal is ready responding as you say sir to the brahman lohicca rosika the barber went to the blessed one and on arrival bowing down to him stood to one side as he was standing there he announced the time saying it is time lord the meal is ready then the blessed one having put on his robes early in the morning carrying his bowl outer robe went together with a community of monks to salavatika meanwhile rosika the barber was following right behind the blessed one and said to him lord an evil viewpoint to this effect has arisen to the brahman lohicca suppose that a brahman or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine having arrived at a skillful doctrine he should not declare it to anyone else for what can one person do for another it would be just the same as if having cut through an old bond one were to make another new bond i say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for another it would be good if the blessed one would extract the brahman lohicca from this evil viewpoint perhaps that will be rosika perhaps that will be then the blessed one went to the brahman lohicca s home on arrival he sat down on a seat made ready the brahman lohicca with his own hand served satisfied the blessed one the community of monks with choice staple non staple foods then when the blessed one had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl the brahman lohicca took a lower seat and sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him is it true lohicca that an evil viewpoint to this effect has arisen to you suppose that a brahman or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine having arrived at a skillful doctrine he should not declare it to anyone else for what can one person do for another it would be just the same as if having cut through an old bond one were to make another new bond i say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for another yes master gotama what do you think lohicca don t you reign over salavatika yes master gotama now suppose someone were to say the brahman lohicca reigns over salavatika he alone should consume the fruits revenues of salavatika and not share them with others would someone speaking in this way be a creator of obstacles for your subjects or would he not he would be a creator of obstacles master gotama and being a creator of obstacles would he be sympathetic for their welfare or not he would not be sympathetic for their welfare master gotama and in one not sympathetic for their welfare would his mind be established in good will for them or in animosity in animosity master gotama when the mind is established in animosity is there wrong view or right view wrong view master gotama now for one of wrong view lohicca i tell you there is one of two destinations either hell or the animal womb what do you think lohicca doesn t king pasenadi kosala reign over yes master gotama now suppose someone were to say king pasenadi kosala reigns over kasi kosala he alone should consume the fruits revenues of kasi kosala and not share them with others would someone speaking in this way be a creator of obstacles for king pasenadi s subjects you others or would he not he would be a creator of obstacles master gotama and being a creator of obstacles would he be sympathetic for their welfare or not he would not be sympathetic for their welfare master gotama and in one not sympathetic for their welfare would his mind be established in good will for them or in animosity in animosity master gotama when the mind is established in animosity is there wrong view or right view wrong view master gotama now for one of wrong view lohicca i tell you there is one of two destinations either hell or the animal womb so then lohicca if anyone were to say the brahman lohicca reigns over salavatika he alone should consume the fruits revenues of salavatika and not share them with others he speaking in this way would be a creator of obstacles for your subjects being a creator of obstacles he would not be sympathetic for their welfare in one not sympathetic for their welfare the mind would be established in animosity for them when the mind is established in animosity there is wrong view for one of wrong view i tell you there is one of two destinations either hell or the animal womb in the same way if anyone were to say suppose that a brahman or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine having arrived at a skillful doctrine he should not declare it to anyone else for what can one person do for another it would be just the same as if having cut through an old bond one were to make another new bond i say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for another he speaking in this way would be a creator of obstacles for those children of good family who coming to the doctrine discipline revealed by the tathagata attain the sort of grand distinction where they attain the fruit of stream entry the fruit of once returning the fruit of non returning the fruit of arahantship and for those who ripen deva wombs for the sake of bringing about the deva state being a creator of obstacles he would not be sympathetic for their welfare in one not sympathetic for their welfare the mind would be established in animosity for them when the mind is established in animosity there is wrong view for one of wrong view i tell you there is one of two destinations either hell or the animal womb and if anyone were to say king pasenadi kosala reigns over kasi kosala he alone should consume the fruits revenues of kasi kosala and not share them with others he speaking in this way would be a creator of obstacles for king pasenadi s subjects you others being a creator of obstacles he would not be sympathetic for their welfare in one not sympathetic for their welfare the mind would be established in animosity for them when the mind is established in animosity there is wrong view for one of wrong view i tell you there is one of two destinations either hell or the animal womb in the same way if anyone were to say suppose that a brahman or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine having arrived at a skillful doctrine he should not declare it to anyone else for what can one person do for another it would be just the same as if having cut through an old bond one were to make another new bond i say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for another he speaking in this way would be a creator of obstacles for those children of good family who coming to the doctrine discipline revealed by the tathagata attain the sort of grand distinction where they attain the fruit of stream entry the fruit of once returning the fruit of non returning the fruit of arahantship and also for those who ripen deva wombs for the sake of bringing about the deva state being a creator of obstacles he would not be sympathetic for their welfare in one not sympathetic for their welfare the mind would be established in animosity for them when the mind is established in animosity there is wrong view for one of wrong view i tell you there is one of two destinations either hell or the animal womb there is the case where a certain teacher has not attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life into homelessness he not having attained that goal of the contemplative life teaches his disciples this is for your welfare this is for your happiness his disciples don t listen don t lend ear don t put forth an intent for gnosis they practice in a way

teacher s instructions it s just as if having cut through an old bond one were to make another new bond i say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for another this is the third teacher who is worthy of criticism in the world and when anyone criticizes this sort of teacher the criticism is true factual righteous unblameworthy when this was said the brahman lohicca said to the blessed one but is there master gotama any teacher who is not worthy of criticism in the world there is lohicca a teacher who is not worthy of criticism in the world but which teacher master gotama is not worthy of criticism in the world there is the case lohicca where a tathagata appears in the world worthy rightly self awakened he teaches the dhamma admirable in its beginning

to these five clinging aggregates i am has not been overcome although i don t assume that i am this no friend then how would he describe it if he were describing it correctly as the scent of the flower that s how he would describe it if he were describing it correctly in the same way friends it s not that i say i am form nor do i say i am other than form it s not that i say i am feeling perception fabrications consciousness nor do i say i am something other than consciousness with regard to these five clinging aggregates i am has not been overcome although i don t assume that i am this friends even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters he still has with regard to the five clinging aggregates a lingering residual i am conceit an i am desire an i am obsession but at a later time he keeps focusing on the phenomena of arising passing away with regard to the five clinging aggregates such is form such its origin such its disappearance such is feeling such is perception such are fabrications such is consciousness such its origin such its disappearance as he keeps focusing on the arising passing away of these five clinging aggregates the lingering residual i am conceit i am desire i am obsession is fully obliterated in the same way friends even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters he still has with regard to the five clinging aggregates a lingering residual i am conceit an i am desire an i am obsession but at a later time he keeps focusing on the phenomena of arising passing away with regard to the five clinging aggregates such is form such its origin such its disappearance such is feeling such is perception such are fabrications such is consciousness such its origin such its disappearance as he keeps focusing on the arising passing away of these five clinging aggregates the lingering residual i am conceit i am desire i am obsession is fully obliterated when this was said the elder monks said to ven khemaka we didn t cross examine ven khemaka with the purpose of troubling him just that we thought ven khemaka is capable of declaring the blessed one s message teaching it describing it setting it forth revealing it explaining it making it plain just as he has in fact declared it taught it described it set it forth revealed it explained it made it plain that is what ven khemaka said gratified the elder monks delighted in his words and while this explanation was being given the minds of sixty some monks through no clinging were fully released from fermentations as was ven khemaka s in this aananda a monk dwells contemplating the body such aananda is the practice for the direction a monk who does not direct his mind to external things this aananda is the practice for the non direction of mind i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was wandering among the mallans together with a large community of monks and came to a brahman village of the mallans named th na the brahman householders of th na heard that gotama the sakyan contemplative gone forth from the sakyan clan is wandering among the mallans together with a large community of monks and has arrived at th na so they filled the well all the way to the brim with grass chaff thinking don t let these shaven headed contemplatives draw drinking water then the blessed one going down from the road went to a certain tree and on arrival sat down on a seat laid out seated he said to ven nanda please nanda fetch me some drinking water from that well when this was said ven nanda replied just now lord the brahman householders of th na filled that well all the way to the brim with grass chaff thinking don t let these shaven headed contemplatives draw drinking water a second time the blessed one said to ven nanda please nanda fetch me some drinking water from that well a second time ven nanda replied just now lord the brahman householders of th na filled that well all the way to the brim with grass chaff thinking don t let these shaven headed contemplatives draw drinking water a third time the blessed one said to ven nanda please nanda fetch me some drinking water from that well responding as you say lord to the blessed one ven nanda taking a bowl went to the well as he was approaching the well it expelled all the grass chaff from its mouth and stood filled to the brim streaming as it were with pristine water undisturbed clear the thought occurred to him how amazing how astounding the great power great might of the tath gata in that while i was approaching the well it expelled all the grass chaff from its mouth and stood filled to the brim streaming as it were with pristine water undisturbed clear taking drinking water in his bowl he went to the blessed one and on arrival said how amazing lord how astounding the great power great might of the tath gata in that while i was approaching the well it expelled all the grass chaff from its mouth and stood filled to the brim streaming as it were with pristine water undisturbed clear drink the water o blessed one drink the water o one well gone then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed what need for a well if there were waters always having cut craving by the root one would go about searching for what a female disciple of the noble ones who grows in terms of these five types of growth grows in the noble growth grasps hold of what is essential what is excellent in the body which five she grows in terms of conviction in terms of virtue in terms of learning in terms of generosity in terms of discernment growing in terms of these five types of growth the female disciple of the noble ones grows in the noble growth grasps hold of what is essential what is excellent in the body growing in conviction virtue discernment generosity learning a virtuous female lay disciple such as this takes hold of the essence within herself i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said on one occasion recently i was staying in so i having known with my awareness the train of thought in baka brahma s awareness as a strong man would extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm vanished into the root of the royal sala tree in the subhaga forest in ukkattha and appeared in that brahma world baka brahma saw me coming in the distance and on seeing me said come good sir you are well come good sir it has been long good sir since you arranged to come here for this good sir is constant this is permanent this is eternal this is total this is not subject to falling away for here one does not take birth does not age does not die does not fall away does not reappear and there is no other higher escape when this was said i told baka brahma how immersed in ignorance is baka brahma how immersed in ignorance is baka brahma in that what is actually inconstant he calls constant what is actually impermanent he calls permanent what is actually non eternal he calls eternal what is actually partial he calls total what is actually subject to falling away he calls not subject to falling away where one takes birth ages dies falls away and reappears he says for here one does not take birth does not age does not die does not fall away does not reappear and there being another higher escape he says there is no other higher escape then mara the evil one taking possession of an attendant of the brahma assembly said to me monk monk don t attack him don t attack him for this brahma monk is the great brahma the conqueror the unconquered the all seeing all powerful the sovereign lord the maker creator chief appointer and ruler father of all that have been and shall be there were monk before your time brahmans contemplatives in the world who found fault with earth and were disgusted with earth they with the break up of the body with the cutting off of life were established in a coarse body who praised earth and were delighted with earth they with the break up of the body with the cutting off of life were established in a refined body so i tell you monk please good sir do only as brahma says don t defy the word of brahma if you defy the word of brahma then as a man when the goddess of fortune approaches chases her away with a stick or as a man falling into hell loses hold of the earth with his hands and feet that will be what you have accomplished please good sir do only as brahma says don t defy the word of brahma don t you see that brahma s assembly has gathered and so mara the evil one directed my attention to brahma s assembly when this was said i told mara the evil one i know you evil one don t assume he doesn t know me you are mara evil one and brahma and brahma s assembly and the attendants of brahma s assembly have all fallen into your hands they have all fallen into your power and you think this one too has come into my hands has come under my control but evil one i have neither come into your hands nor have i come under your control when this was said baka brahma told me but good sir what is actually constant i call constant what is actually permanent i call permanent what is actually eternal i call eternal what is actually total i call total what is actually not subject to falling away i call not subject to falling away where one does not take birth age die fall away or reappear i say for this does not take birth does not age does not die does not fall away does not reappear and there being no other higher escape i say there is no other higher escape there were monk before your time brahmans contemplatives in the world whose ascetic practice lasted as long as your entire life span they knew when there was another higher escape that there was another higher escape or when there was no other higher escape that there was no other higher escape so i tell you monk both that you will not find another higher escape and that to that extent you will reap your share of trouble weariness monk if you relish earth you will lie close to me lie within my domain for me to banish and to do with as i like if you relish liquid fire wind beings devas pajapati brahma you will lie close to me lie within my domain for me to banish and to do with as i like i too know that brahma if i relish earth i will lie close to you lie within your domain for you to banish and to do with as you like if i relish liquid fire wind beings devas pajapati brahma i will lie close to you lie within your domain for you to banish and to do with as you like moreover i discern your sphere i discern your splendor baka brahma has this much great power baka brahma has this much great might baka brahma has this much great influence well monk how do you discern my sphere how do you discern my splendor baka brahma has this much great power baka brahma has this much great might baka brahma has this much great influence as far as suns moons revolve shining illuminating the directions over a thousand fold world your control holds sway there you know those above below those with lust those without the state of what is as it is the state of what becomes otherwise the coming going of beings that brahma is how i discern your sphere that is how i discern your splendor baka brahma has this much great power baka brahma has this much great might baka brahma has this much great influence there are brahma bodies other than yours that you don t know don t see but that i know i see there is brahma the body named abhassara radiant luminous from which you fell away reappeared here there is brahma the body named subhakinha beautiful black refulgent glory the body named vehapphala sky fruit great fruit the body named abhibhu conqueror having directly known earth as earth and having directly known the extent of what has not been experienced through the earthness of earth having directly known liquid as liquid fire as fire wind as wind beings as beings devas as devas pajapati as pajapati brahma as brahma the radiant as radiant the beautiful black as the beautiful black the sky fruit as the sky fruit the conqueror as the conqueror having directly known the all as the all if good sir you have directly known the extent of what has not been experienced through the allness of the all may it not turn out to be actually vain and void for you consciousness without surface endless radiant all around has not been experienced through the earthness of earth the liquidity of liquid the fieriness of fire the windiness of wind the allness of the all well then good sir i will disappear from you well then brahma disappear from me if you can then baka brahma thinking i will disappear from gotama the contemplative i will disappear from gotama the contemplative was not able to disappear from me when this was said i said to baka brahma well then brahma i will disappear from you well then good sir disappear from me if you can so then monks i fabricated a fabrication of psychic power to the extent that brahma the brahma assembly and the attendants of the brahma assembly heard my voice but did not see me having disappeared i recited this verse having seen danger right in becoming and becoming searching for non becoming then in brahma the brahma assembly and the attendants of the brahma assembly there arose a sense of amazement awe how amazing how awesome the great power the great might of gotama the contemplative never before have we seen or heard of any other contemplative or brahman of such great power such great might as that of this gotama the contemplative who went forth from a sakyan clan living in a generation that so delights in becoming so rejoices in becoming is so fond of becoming he has pulled out becoming by the root then mara the evil one taking possession of an attendant of the brahma assembly said to me if good sir this is what you discern if this is what you have awakened to do not lead lay disciples or those gone forth do not teach the dhamma to lay disciples or those gone forth do not yearn for lay disciples or those gone forth there were good sir before your time brahmans contemplatives in the world who claimed to be worthy rightly self awakened they led lay disciples those gone forth they taught the dhamma to lay disciples those gone forth they yearned for lay disciples those gone forth having led lay disciples those gone forth having taught the dhamma to lay disciples those gone forth having yearned for lay disciples those gone forth they on the break up of the body with the cutting off of life were established in a coarse body there were good sir before your time brahmans contemplatives in the world who claimed to be worthy rightly self awakened they did not lead lay disciples or those gone forth they did not teach the dhamma to lay disciples or those gone forth they did not yearn for lay disciples or those gone forth having not led lay disciples or those gone forth having not taught the dhamma to lay disciples or those gone forth having not yearned for lay disciples or those gone forth they on the break up of the body with the cutting off of life were established in a refined body so monk i tell you this please good sir be effortless abide committed to a pleasant abiding in the here now for it is skillful good sir that this not be taught don t instruct others when this was said i told mara the evil one i know you evil one don t assume he doesn t know me you are mara evil one and it s not sympathetic to welfare that you speak thus to me it s sympathetic to what is not welfare that you speak thus to me you think this evil one those to whom gotama the contemplative will teach the dhamma will defy my sovereignty without being rightly self awakened evil one your contemplatives brahmans claimed to be rightly self awakened i however being rightly self awakened claim to be rightly self awakened for when the tathagata is teaching the dhamma to his disciples he is such when he is not teaching the dhamma to his disciples he is such when leading his disciples he is such when not leading his disciples he is such why is that the fermentations that defile that lead to further becoming that disturb that ripen in stress that tend to future birth aging death those the tathagata has abandoned their root destroyed like an uprooted thus because of the silencing of mara and because of the brahma s invitation this discourse is entitled the brahma invitation thus have i heard once the blessed one was staying at savatthi in jeta s grove anathapindika s monastery how many kinds of feelings reverend udayi were taught by the blessed one after these words carpenter fivetools said not three kinds of feelings reverend udayi were taught by the blessed one it is two kinds of feelings that were stated by the blessed one pleasant and painful feelings the neutral feeling was said by the blessed one to belong to peaceful and sublime happiness but the venerable udayi replied it is not two feelings that were taught by the blessed one but three pleasant painful and neutral feelings this exchange of views was repeated for a second and a third time but neither was carpenter fivetools able to convince the venerable udayi nor could the venerable udayi convince carpenter fivetools it so happened that the venerable ananda had listened to that conversation and went to see the blessed one about it having saluted the blessed one respectfully he sat down at one side thus seated he repeated the entire conversation that had taken place between the venerable udayi and carpenter fivetools the blessed one said ananda udayi s way of presentation with which carpenter fivetools disagreed was correct indeed but also carpenter fivetool s way of presentation with which udayi disagreed was correct in one way of presentation i have spoken of two kinds of feelings and in other ways of presentation i have spoken of three of six of eighteen of thirty six and of one hundred and eight kinds of feelings regarding the dhamma thus shown by me in different ways if there are those who do not agree with do not consent to and do not accept what is rightly said and rightly spoken it may be expected of them that they will quarrel and get into arguments and disputes hurting each other with sharp words regarding the dhamma thus shown by me in different ways if there are those who agree with consent to and accept what is rightly said and rightly spoken it may be expected of them that they will live in concord and amity without dispute like milk that easily mixes with water looking at each other with friendly eyes there are five strands of sense desire what are these five forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desirable agreeable and endearing bound up with sensual desire and tempting to lust sounds cognizable by the ear odors cognizable by the nose flavors cognizable by the tongue tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desirable agreeable and endearing bound up with sense desire and tempting to lust these are the five strands of sense desire the pleasure and joy arising dependent on these five strands of sense desire that is called sensual pleasure if someone were to say this is the highest pleasure that can be experienced i would not concede that and why not because there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime and what is that pleasure here with the stilling of thought conception and discursive thinking a monk enters upon and abides in the second meditative absorption in the sphere of the infinity of space of the infinity of consciousness of no thingness of neither perception nor non perception if someone were to say this is the highest pleasure that can be experienced i would not concede that and why not because there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime and what is this pleasure here by completely surmounting the sphere of neither perception nor non perception a monk enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feeling this is the other kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime it may happen ananda that wanderers of other sects will be saying this the recluse gotama speaks of the cessation of perception and feeling and describes it as pleasure what is this pleasure and how is this a pleasure those who say so should be told the blessed one describes as pleasure not only the feeling of pleasure but a tathagata describes as pleasure whenever and whereinsoever it is obtained that is what the blessed one said the venerable ananda was satisfied and delighted in the blessed one s words see also at yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said monks there are these five means of propagation which five root propagation stem propagation joint propagation cutting propagation seed propagation as the fifth and if these five means of propagation are not broken not rotten not damaged by wind sun mature and well buried but there is no earth and no water would they exhibit growth increase proliferation no lord and if these five means of propagation are broken rotten damaged by wind sun immature and poorly buried but there is earth water would they exhibit growth increase proliferation no lord and if these five means of propagation are not broken not rotten not damaged by wind sun mature and well buried and there is earth water would they exhibit growth increase proliferation yes lord like the earth property monks is how the four standing spots for consciousness should be seen like the liquid property is how delight passion should be seen like the five means of propagation is how consciousness together with its nutriment should be seen should consciousness when taking a stance stand attached to a physical form supported by form should consciousness when taking a stance stand attached to feeling supported by feeling established on feeling watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase proliferation should consciousness when taking a stance stand attached to perception supported by perception established on perception watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase proliferation should consciousness when taking a stance stand attached to fabrications supported by fabrications established on fabrications watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase proliferation were someone to say i will describe a coming a going a passing away an arising a growth an increase or a proliferation of consciousness apart from form from feeling from perception from fabrications that would be impossible if a monk abandons passion for the property of form if a monk abandons passion for the property of feeling if a monk abandons passion for the property of perception if a monk abandons passion for the property of fabrications if a monk abandons passion for the property of consciousness then owing to the abandonment of passion the support is cut off and there is no base for consciousness consciousness thus unestablished not proliferating not performing any function is released owing to its release it is steady owing to its steadiness it is contented owing to its contentment it is not agitated not agitated he the monk is totally unbound right within he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world phagguna if anyone were to reproach you right to your face even then you should abandon those urges and thoughts which are worldly there phagguna you should train yourself thus neither shall my mind be affected by this nor shall i give vent to evil words but i shall remain full of concern and pity with a mind of love and i shall not give in to hatred this is how phagguna you should train yourself phagguna if anyone were to give you a blow with the hand or hit you with a clod of earth or with a stick or with a sword even then you should abandon those urges and thoughts which are worldly there phagguna you should train yourself thus neither shall my mind be affected by this nor shall i give vent to evil words but i shall remain full of concern and pity with a mind of love and i shall not give in to hatred this is how phagguna you should train yourself the story of the mistress vedehika in the past monks in this very savatthi there was a mistress vedehika by name and monks this good reputation had spread about the mistress vedehika the mistress vedehika is gentle the mistress vedehika is meek the mistress vedehika is calm now monks the mistress vedehika had a maid servant kali by name who was able energetic and very methodical in her work then monks it occurred to kali the maid servant this good reputation has spread about my lady the mistress vedehika is gentle the mistress vedehika is meek the mistress vedehika is calm could it be that my lady does have anger within her which she does not show or could it be that she does not have anger or is it because i am methodical in my job that my lady though she does have anger within does not show it and not because she does not have anger why don t i test my lady thus monks the maid servant kali got up late the next morning and monks the mistress vedehika told this to the maid servant kali hey you kali what is it lady why did you get up so late oh that is nothing lady what that is nothing indeed you bad maid servant you got up late angry and displeased she frowned then monks it occurred to kali the maid servant though she does have anger within my lady does not show it it is not that she does not have anger it is because i am methodical in my job that though she does have anger within my lady does not show it and not because she does not have anger why don t i test my lady further now monks kali the maid servant got up even later than before then monks the mistress vedehika told the maid servant kali hey you kali what is it lady why did you get up even later than before oh that is nothing lady what that is nothing indeed you bad maid servant you got up even later than before angry and displeased she gave vent to her displeasure then monks it occurred to the maid servant kali though she does have anger within my lady does not show it it is not that she does not have anger it is because i am methodical in my job that though she does have anger within my lady does not show it and not because she does not have anger why don t i test my lady further and monks the maid servant kali got up even later than before then monks the mistress vedehika told the maid servant kali hey you kali what is it lady why did you get up so late oh that is nothing lady what that is nothing indeed you bad maid servant you got up so late and angry and displeased she hit her on the head with the door bar and this injured her head now monks the maid servant kali with her head injured and blood oozing went about among the neighbors shouting look sirs at the deed of the gentle one look sirs at the deed of the meek one look sirs at the deed of the calm one how can she saying to her own maid servant you got up late today angry and displeased having taken a door bar give me a blow on the head and injure my head and then monks this ill repute spread thereafter about the mistress vedehika the mistress vedehika is violent the mistress vedehika is arrogant the mistress vedehika is not calm in the same way monks some monk here is very gentle very meek and very calm so long as disagreeable ways of speech do not assail him but when disagreeable ways of speech do assail the monk it is then that the monk is to be judged whether he is gentle meek or calm monks i do not call that monk dutiful who is dutiful on account of the requisites he gets i e the robe almsfood lodging and medicaments whereby he falls into pseudo dutifulness and why for monks when that monk fails to get the requisites of the robe almsfood lodging and medicaments he ceases to be dutiful and is not in keeping with the norms of dutifulness but monks whichever monk out of reverence for the teaching out of respect for the teaching out of dedication to the teaching showing honor to the teaching and giving regard to the teaching comes to be dutiful and is in keeping with the norms of dutifulness him do i consider as dutiful therefore monks you should consider only out of reverence for the teaching out of respect for the teaching out of dedication to the teaching showing honor to the teaching and giving regard to the teaching shall we become dutiful shall we be in keeping with the norms of dutifulness thus indeed monks you should train yourselves positive response of love monks there are these five modes of speech which people might use when speaking to you speech that is timely or untimely true or false gentle or harsh with a good or a harmful motive and with a loving heart or hostility monks some might speak to you using speech that is timely or untimely monks some might speak to you according to truth or falsely monks some might speak to you gently or harshly monks some might speak to you with a good motive or with a harmful motive monks some might speak to you with a loving heart or with hostility on all occasions monks you should train yourselves thus neither shall our minds be affected by this nor for this matter shall we give vent to evil words but we shall remain full of concern and pity with a mind of love and we shall not give in to hatred on the contrary we shall live projecting thoughts of universal love to that very person making him as well as the whole world the object of our thoughts of universal love thoughts that have grown great exalted and measureless we shall dwell radiating these thoughts which are void of hostility and ill will it is in this way monks that you should train yourselves the great earth suppose monks a person were to come to you holding a hoe and a basket and he were to say i shall make this great earth earthless then he would strew the earth here and there spit here and there and urinate here and there and would say be earthless be earthless what do you think monks would this person render this great earth earthless no indeed not most venerable sir and why because this great earth most venerable sir is deep and without measure it cannot possibly be turned earthless on the contrary that person would only reap weariness and frustration in the same way monks others may use these five modes of speech when speaking to you speech that is timely or untimely true or false gentle or harsh with a good or a harmful motive and with a loving heart or hostility in this way monks you should train yourselves neither shall our minds be affected by this nor for this matter shall we give vent to evil words but we shall remain full of concern and pity with a mind of love and we shall not give in to hatred on the contrary we shall live projecting thoughts of universal love to that very person making him as well as the whole world the object of our thoughts of universal love thoughts that have grown great exalted and measureless we shall dwell radiating these thoughts which are void of hostility and ill will it is in this way monks that you should train yourselves empty space suppose monks a person were to approach you carrying paints of lacquer turmeric indigo or carmine and he were to say i will draw this picture i will make this painting appear on this empty space what do you think monks could he make this painting appear on empty space no indeed not most venerable sir and why not because this empty space most venerable sir is formless and invisible he cannot possibly draw a picture or make a painting appear on this empty space on the contrary that person will only reap weariness and frustration in the same way monks others may use these five modes of speech when speaking to you speech that is timely or untimely true or false gentle or harsh with a good or a harmful motive and with a loving heart or hostility in this way monks you should train yourselves neither shall our minds be affected by this nor for this matter

to that very person making him as well as the whole world the object of our thoughts of universal love thoughts that have grown great exalted and measureless we shall dwell radiating these thoughts which are void of hostility and ill will it is in this way monks that you should train yourselves the river ganges suppose monks a person were to come holding a burning grass torch and he were to say with this burning grass torch i shall set fire to and scorch this river ganges what do you think monks could that person set fire to and scorch the river ganges with a grass torch no indeed not most venerable sir and why not because most venerable sir the river ganges is deep and without measure it is not possible to set fire to and scorch the river ganges with a burning grass torch on the contrary that person will only reap weariness and frustration in the same way monks others may use these five modes of speech when speaking to you speech that is timely or untimely true or false gentle or harsh with a good or a harmful motive and with a loving heart or hostility in this way monks you should train yourselves neither shall our minds be affected by this nor for this matter shall

that very person making him as well as the whole world the object of our thoughts of universal love thoughts that have grown great exalted and measureless we shall dwell radiating these thoughts which are void of hostility and ill will it is in this way monks that you should train yourselves the catskin bag suppose monks there was a supple and silky leather bag made of catskin that had been beaten tanned cured and fully processed and made completely free of all creases and wrinkles then a man were to come with a stick or mallet and say with this stick or mallet i shall make creases and wrinkles in this supple and silky catskin bag which has been beaten tanned cured and fully processed and made free of creases and wrinkles what do you think monks could that person with a stick or mallet make creases and wrinkles in that supple and silky catskin bag which has been beaten tanned cured and fully processed and made free of creases and wrinkles no indeed not most venerable sir and why not because most venerable sir that supple and silky leather bag made of catskin has been beaten tanned cured and fully processed and made free of creases and wrinkles it is not possible to make creases and wrinkles in it with a stick or mallet on the contrary he will only reap weariness and frustration in the same way monks others may use these five modes of speech when speaking to you speech that is timely or untimely true or false gentle or harsh with a good or a harmful motive and with a loving heart or hostility in this way monks you should train yourselves neither shall our minds be

projecting thoughts of universal love to that very person making him as well as the whole world the object of our thoughts of universal love thoughts that have grown great exalted and measureless we shall dwell radiating these thoughts which are void of hostility and ill will it is in this way monks that you should train yourselves the parable of the saw monks even if bandits were to savagely sever you limb by limb with a double handled saw even then whoever of you harbors ill will at heart would not be upholding my teaching monks even in such a situation you should train yourselves thus neither shall our minds be affected by this nor for this matter shall we give vent to evil words but we shall remain full of concern and pity with a mind of love and we shall not give in to hatred on the contrary we shall live projecting thoughts of universal love to those very persons making them as well as the whole world the object of our thoughts of universal love thoughts that have grown great exalted and measureless we shall dwell radiating these thoughts which are void of hostility and ill will it is in this way monks that you should train yourselves monks if you should keep this instruction on the parable of the saw constantly in mind do you see any mode of speech subtle or gross that you could not endure no lord therefore monks you should keep this instruction on the parable of the saw constantly in mind that will conduce to your well being and happiness for long indeed that is what the blessed one said delighted those monks acclaimed the teaching of the blessed one there are these two kinds of gifts a gift of material things a gift of the dhamma of the two this is supreme a gift of the dhamma there are these two kinds of sharing sharing of material things sharing of the dhamma of the two this is supreme sharing of the dhamma there are these two kinds of assistance assistance with material things assistance with the dhamma of the two this is supreme help with the dhamma there are these two kinds of mass donations a mass donation of material things a mass donation of the dhamma of the two this is supreme a mass donation of the dhamma he who unstinting made the mass donation of dhamma the tathagata sympathetic to all beings to one of that sort the best of beings human divine living beings pay homage to one gone to the beyond of becoming here monks the well instructed ariyan disciple who has regard for the noble ones is skilled and trained in the dhamma of the noble ones of those who are worthy does not regard body as the self the self as having body body as being in the self or the self as being in the body change occurs to this man s body and it becomes different but despite this change and alteration in his body his consciousness is not preoccupied with bodily change not being full of desire and attachment he is not worried here bhikkhus a certain person abides with his heart imbued with loving kindness extending over one quarter likewise the second quarter likewise the third quarter likewise the fourth quarter and so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides with his heart abundant exalted measureless in loving kindness without hostility or ill will extending over the all encompassing world he finds gratification in that finds it desirable and looks to it for his well being steady and resolute thereon he abides much in it and if he dies without losing it he reappears among the gods of a high divinity s retinue now the gods of a high divinity s retinue have a life span of one aeon an ordinary person who has not attained the noble eightfold path stays there for his life span but after he has used up the whole life span enjoyed by those gods he leaves it all and according to what his past deeds may have been he may go down even to hell or to an animal womb or to the ghost realm but one who has given ear to the perfect one stays there in that heaven for his life span and after he has used up the whole life span enjoyed by those gods he eventually attains complete extinction of lust hate and delusion in that same kind of heavenly existence it is this that distinguishes that differentiates the wise hearer who is ennobled by attainment of the noble path from the unwise ordinary man when that is to say there is a destination for reappearance after death but an arahant has made an end of birth on one occasion the blessed one was staying near rajagaha in the bamboo grove the squirrels sanctuary now at that time a certain monk by the name of elderthen a large number of monks went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they informed him lord there is a certain monk by the name of elder who lives alone and extols the virtues of living alone then the blessed one told a certain monk come monk in my name call the monk named elder saying the teacher calls you my friend as you say lord the monk answered and having gone to ven elder on arrival he said the teacher calls you my friend as you say my friend ven elder replied then he went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him is it true elder that you live alone and extol the virtues of living alone yes lord but how do you live alone and extol the virtues of living alone lord alone i enter the village for alms alone i return alone i sit withdrawn in meditation alone i do walking meditation that is how i live alone and extol the virtues of living alone there is that way of living alone elder i don t say that there isn t still listen well to how your living alone is perfected in its details and pay close attention i will speak as you say lord ven elder responded the blessed one said and how is living alone perfected in its details there is the case where whatever is past is abandoned whatever is future is relinquished and any passion desire with regard to states of being attained in the present is well subdued that is what the blessed one said having said it the one well gone further said this all conquering all knowing intelligent with regard to all things unadhering all abandoning released in the ending of craving him at this time king pasenadi of kosala was on the upper terrace of the palace with queen mallikaa and the king asked her mallikaa is there anyone dearer to you than yourself your majesty there is no one dearer to me than myself and you sire is anyone dearer to you than yourself nor is there anyone dearer to me mallikaa than myself then the king went down from the palace and visited the blessed one though in thought we range throughout the world we ll nowhere find a thing more dear than self so since others hold the self so dear he who loves himself should injure none i have heard that at one time the blessed one was staying at there is the case where a monk as day departs and night returns reflects many are the possible causes of my death a snake might bite me a scorpion might sting me a centipede might bite me that would be how my death would come about that would be an obstruction for me stumbling i might fall my food digested might trouble me my bile might be provoked my phlegm piercing wind forces in the body might be provoked that would be how my death would come about that would be an obstruction for me then the monk should investigate are there any evil unskillful mental qualities unabandoned by me that would be an obstruction for me were i to die in the night if on reflecting he realizes that there are evil unskillful mental qualities unabandoned by him that would be an obstruction for him were he to die in the night then he should put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor undivided mindfulness alertness for the abandoning of those very same evil unskillful qualities further there is the case where a monk as night departs and day returns reflects many are the

for me then the monk should investigate are there any evil unskillful mental qualities unabandoned by me that would be an obstruction for me were i to die during the day if on reflecting he realizes that there are evil unskillful mental qualities unabandoned by him that would be an obstruction for him were he to die during the day then he should put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor undivided mindfulness alertness for the abandoning of those very same evil unskillful qualities this monks is how mindfulness of death is developed pursued so that it is of great fruit great benefit gains a footing in the deathless and has the deathless as its final end that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words i have heard that on one occasion the

with arisen evil unskillful qualities he abandons them dispels them demolishes them wipes them out of existence this is how a monk pick outs flies eggs and how does a monk dress wounds there is the case where a monk on seeing a form with the eye does not grasp at any theme or details by which if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him he practices for its restraint he protects the faculty of the eye on hearing a sound with the ear on smelling an odor with the nose on tasting a flavor with the

dhamma vinaya that is what the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words at why is that from an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration a beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating wandering on long have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things enough to become dispassionate enough to be released i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the as you say lord ven ananda responded then the blessed one went into the great wood and sat down at the root of a certain tree for the day s abiding then this calls for a talk householder let s go see the blessed one let s approach him and on arrival tell him this matter however he explains it to us we will bear it in mind as you say sir tapussa the householder responded to ven ananda so it is ananda so it is even i myself before my awakening when i was still an unawakened bodhisatta thought renunciation is good seclusion is good but my heart didn t leap up at renunciation didn t grow confident steadfast or firm seeing it as peace the thought occurred to me what is the cause what is the reason why my heart doesn t leap up at renunciation doesn t grow confident steadfast or firm seeing it as peace then the thought occurred to me i haven t seen the drawback of sensual pleasures i haven t pursued that theme i haven t understood the reward of renunciation i haven t familiarized myself with it that s why my heart doesn t leap up at renunciation doesn t grow confident steadfast or firm seeing it as peace then the thought occurred to me if having seen the drawback of sensual pleasures i were to pursue that theme and if having understood the reward of renunciation i were to familiarize myself with it there s the possibility that my heart would leap up at renunciation grow confident steadfast firm seeing it as peace so at a later time having seen the drawback of sensual pleasures i pursued that theme having understood the reward of renunciation i familiarized myself with it my heart leaped up at renunciation grew confident steadfast firm seeing it as peace then quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities i entered remained in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation as i remained there i was beset with attention to perceptions dealing with sensuality that was an affliction for me just as pain arises as an affliction for a healthy person even so the attention to perceptions dealing with sensuality that beset me was an affliction for me the thought occurred to me what if with the stilling of directed thoughts evaluations i were to enter remain in the second jhana rapture pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought evaluation internal assurance but my heart didn t leap up at being without directed thought didn t grow confident steadfast or firm seeing it as peace the thought occurred to me what is the cause what is the reason why my heart doesn t leap up at

if with the fading of rapture i were to remain in equanimity mindful alert to be physically sensitive to pleasure and to enter remain in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare equanimous mindful he has a pleasant abiding but my heart didn t leap up at being without rapture didn t grow confident steadfast or firm seeing it as peace so at a later time having seen the drawback of rapture

total end ananda as long as i had not attained emerged from these nine step by step dwelling attainments in forward backward order in this way i did not claim to have directly awakened to the right self awakening unexcelled in the cosmos with its devas maras brahmas with its contemplatives brahmans its royalty common people but as soon as i had attained emerged from these nine step by step dwelling attainments in forward backward order in this way then i did claim to have directly awakened to the right self awakening unexcelled in the cosmos with its devas maras brahmas with its contemplatives brahmans its royalty common people knowledge vision arose in me my release is unshakable this is the last birth there is now no further becoming at savatthi then a certain very rich brahman shabby shabbily dressed went to the blessed one and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after this exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him why brahman are you shabby shabbily dressed just now master gotama my four sons at their wives instigation threw me out of the house in that case brahman memorize these verses and then recite them when a large assembly of people have gathered in the town hall and your sons are sitting there too then the very rich brahman having memorized these verses in the presence of the blessed one recited them when a large assembly of people had gathered in the town hall and his sons were sitting there too those whose birth i delighted in whose growth i desired at their wives instigation have chased me away as dogs would swine wicked vile though they call me dad demons in the disguise of sons who abandon me in old age as an old horse of no more use is deprived of fodder so the elderly father of those foolish boys begs at other people s homes my staff serves me better than those disobedient sons it fends off ferocious bulls ferocious curs in the dark it goes before me down steep slopes it gives support through the power of my staff when i stumble i still stand firm then the brahman s sons having led him home bathed him and each provided him in a pair of cloths so the brahman taking one pair of cloths went to the blessed one and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him after this exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one we brahmans master gotama look for a teacher s fee for our teacher may master gotama accept this teacher s portion from me the blessed one accepted it out of sympathy then the very rich brahman said to the blessed one thoseas coming from noonday rest on vulture s peak i saw an elephant his bathing done forth from the river issue and a man taking his goad bade the great creature stretch his foot obeyed and to his neck the driver sprang i saw the untamed tamed i saw him bent to master s will and making inwardly i passed into the forest depths and there i faith i trained and ordered all my heart when dwelling on views as supreme a person makes them the utmost thing in the world from that calls all others inferior and so he s not free from disputes when he sees his advantage in what s seen heard sensed or in precepts practices seizing it there he sees all else as inferior that too say the skilled is a binding knot that in dependence on which you regard another as inferior so a monk shouldn t be dependent on what s seen heard or sensed or on precepts practices nor should he conjure a view in the world in connection with knowledge or precepts practices shouldn t take himself to be equal shouldn t think himself inferior or superlative abandoning what he had embraced abandoning self bhikkhus these two bright principles protect the world what are the two shame and fear of wrongdoing if bhikkhus these two bright principles did not protect the world there would not be discerned respect for mother or maternal aunt or maternal uncle s wife or a teacher s wife or the wives of other honored persons and the world would have fallen into promiscuity as with goats sheep chickens pigs dogs and jackals but as these two bright principles protect the world there is discerned respect for mother and the wives of other honored persons monks these the perception of the unattractive when developed pursued is of great fruit of great benefit

disciple of the noble ones thus consummate in virtue thus consummate in concentration thus consummate in discernment who through the ending of the mental fermentations enters remains in the fermentation free awareness release discernment release having known made them manifest for himself right in the here now in this way mahanama the blessed one has talked both of the virtue of one who is in training and of the virtue of one whose training is complete he has talked both of the concentration of one who is in training and of the concentration of one whose training is complete he has talked both of the discernment of one who is in training and of the discernment of one whose training is complete at savatthi monks the earth property is inconstant changeable alterable the liquid

might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry shades he is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry one who after pondering with a modicum of discernment has accepted that these phenomena are this way is called a dhamma follower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the run of the mill he is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry shades he is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry one who knows and sees that these phenomena are this way is called a stream enterer steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for self awakening thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living at dakkhinagiri monastery in the brahmana village ekanala in magadha now at that time it being the sowing season five hundred plows of the brahman kasibharadvaja were put to use then in the forenoon the blessed one having dressed himself took bowl and double robe and went to the place where brahman kasibharadvaja s work was going on it was the time of food distribution by the brahman and the blessed one drew near and stood at one side bharadvaja seeing the blessed one standing there for alms said to him recluse i do plow and do sow and having plowed and sown i eat you also recluse should plow and sow having plowed and sown you should eat i too brahman plow and sow having plowed and sown i eat we do not see the venerable gotama s yoke or plow or plowshare or goad or oxen nevertheless the venerable gotama says i too brahman plow and sow having plowed and sown i eat thereupon the brahman addressed the blessed one in a stanza then brahman kasibharadvaja filling a golden bowl with milk rice offered it to the blessed one saying may the venerable gotama partake of this milk rice a plowman indeed is venerable gotama who plows a plow for the fruit of deathlessness nibbana to whom then venerable gotama shall i give this milk rice brahman in the world of devas maras and brahmas or among the generation of recluses brahmanas deities and humans there is no one by whom this milk rice if eaten could be wholly digested except by the tathagata the buddha or the disciple of a tathagata therefore brahman either cast this milk rice where there is no grass or into water where there are no living creatures thereupon the brahman flung that milk rice into water where there were no living creatures and the milk rice thrown into the water smoked and steamed making the noise then the brahman kasibharadvaja alarmed with hair standing on end approached and fell with his head at the blessed one s feet and said as follows most excellent o gotama is thy teaching most excellent just as a man would set upright what is overturned reveal what is concealed point out the way to one gone astray bring an oil lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes could see objects even so the dhamma doctrine has been declared in many a manner by the venerable gotama i take refuge in the venerable gotama the buddha in the dhamma and in the sangha the order i wish to receive the novice s ordination brahman kasibharadvaja duly received both the there are these four types of brightness which four the brightness of the sun the brightness of the moon the brightness of fire and the brightness of discernment these are the four types of brightness and of these four types of brightness the foremost is the brightness of discernment punnaka the buddha punnaka the buddha punnaka the buddha the learner on the pathmonks there are these eight individuals who are worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation the unsurpassed field of merit for the world which eight the one who has entered the stream the one who has entered upon the course for the realization of the fruit of

profession or other without encountering an unskillful day were to earn a kahapana two kahapanas three four five six seven eight nine ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred kahapanas would he deserve to be called a capable man full of initiative yes lord now what do you think earning one hundred one thousand kahapanas a day saving up his gains living for one hundred years would a man arrive at a great mass of wealth yes lord now what do you think would that man because of that wealth on account of that wealth with that wealth as the cause live sensitive to unalloyed bliss for a day a night half a day or half a night no lord and why is that sensual pleasures are inconstant hollow false deceptive by nature now sakyans there is the case where a disciple of mine spending ten years practicing as i have instructed would live sensitive to unalloyed bliss for a hundred years a hundred centuries a hundred millennia and he would be a once returner a non returner or at the very least a stream winner let alone ten years there is the case where a disciple of mine spending nine years eight years seven six five four three two years one year practicing as i have instructed would

in this life so endangered by grief in this life so endangered by death you sometimes observe the eight factored uposatha and sometimes don t then from this day forward lord we will observe the eight factored uposatha thus have i heard at one time the lord was staying at anupiya in the mango orchard at that time the venerable bhaddiya kaligodha s son on going into the forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty place constantly uttered ah what bliss ah what bliss a number of bhikkhus heard the venerable bhaddiya constantly uttering ah what bliss ah what bliss and the thought came to them no doubt friend the venerable bhaddiya kaligodha s son is dissatisfied with leading the holy life since formerly when he was a householder he enjoyed the bliss of royalty and when recollecting that on going into the forest he utters ah what bliss ah what bliss then a number of bhikkhus approached the lord prostrated themselves sat down to one side and reported this to the lord then the lord addressed a certain bhikkhu come bhikkhu in my name tell the bhikkhu bhaddiya the teacher calls you friend bhaddiya very well revered sir the bhikkhu replied and approaching the venerable bhaddiya kaligodha s son he said the teacher calls you friend bhaddiya very well friend the venerable bhaddiya replied and approaching the lord he prostrated himself and sat down to one side the lord then said to him is it true bhaddiya that on going into the forest you utter ah what bliss ah what bliss yes revered sir but bhaddiya what do you see that prompts you to do so formerly revered sir when i was a householder and enjoyed the bliss of royalty inside and outside my inner apartments guards were appointed inside and outside the city guards were appointed inside and outside the district guards were appointed but revered sir although i was thus guarded and protected i lived fearful agitated distrustful and afraid but now revered sir on going alone into the forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty place i am fearless unagitated confident and unafraid i live unconcerned unruffled my needs satisfied with a mind become like a deer s seeing this revered sir prompts me on going to the forest to utter constantly ah what bliss ah what bliss then on realizing its significance the lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance in whom exist no inner stirrings having passed beyond being this or that free from fear blissful and sorrowless the devas are not capable of seeing him i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying among the have you informed no lord we haven t informed ven sariputta inform sariputta monks sariputta is wise a great help to the monks who are his fellows in the holy life as you say lord the monks replied at that time ven sariputta was sitting

him keeping him to their right went to ven sariputta on arrival they exchanged courteous greetings with him after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies they sat to one side as they were sitting

criticizing you we would come from a long way away to hear the explication of these words in ven sariputta s presence it would be good if ven sariputta himself would enlighten us as to their meaning

marriage he would be reproached by casting remarks on his deformed teeth or eyes or any part of the body and the non humans would put an empty bowl over his head and split it head in seven pieces happy one there are non humans who are fierce violent given to retaliation those non humans heed neither the four great kings nor their ministers nor their attendants they are called rebels against the four great kings even as in the kingdom of magadha the thieves heed neither the king of magadha nor the ministers nor their attendants and are called rebels against the king of magadha so there are non humans who are fierce as before they are called rebels against the four great kings happy one if any non human male or female yakkha youth or maiden yakkha yakkha minister or any yakkha or yakkha attendant male or female gandhabba as before male or female kumbhanda male or female naga were to walk with a monk or nun or a layman or laywoman or stand or sit or lie down with him or her

protected and unharmed happy one we now take our leave of you for we have many duties to attend to so said the four great kings great kings it is time for your departure replied the buddha the four great kings arose from their seats and saluting the blessed one circled round him on his right side and there and then vanished from among the attendant yakkhas some arose from their seats and saluted the blessed one circled round him on his right side and there and then vanished some exchanged greetings with the blessed one conversing in a friendly and courteous manner and there and then vanished some saluted the blessed one with clasped hands and there and then vanished some announced their name and lineage and there and then vanished some in silence there and then vanished when the night had passed the blessed one addressed the monks the buddha related to the monks word for word what has been said by the great king vessavana see above learn by heart monks the atanata protection constantly make use of it bear it in mind this atanata protection monks pertains to your welfare and by virtue of it monks and nuns laymen and laywomen may live at ease guarded protected and unharmed this the blessed one said those monks glad at heart rejoiced at the words of the blessed one at savatthi then just now lord a money lending householder died in savatthi i have come from conveying his heirless fortune to the royal palace eight million in silver to say nothing of the gold but even though he was a money lending householder his enjoyment of food was like this he ate broken rice pickle brine his enjoyment of clothing was like this he wore three lengths of hempen cloth his enjoyment of a vehicle was like this he rode in a dilapidated little cart with an awning of leaves that s the way it is great king that s the way it is when a person of no integrity acquires lavish wealth he doesn t provide for his own pleasure satisfaction nor for the pleasure satisfaction of his parents nor for the pleasure satisfaction of his wife children nor for the pleasure satisfaction of his slaves servants assistants nor for the pleasure satisfaction of his friends he doesn t institute for brahmans contemplatives offerings of supreme aim heavenly resulting in happiness leading to heaven when his wealth isn t properly put to use kings make off with it or thieves make off with it or fire burns it or water sweeps it away or hateful heirs make off with it thus his wealth not properly put to use goes to waste and not to any good use but when a person of integrity acquires lavish wealth he provides for his own pleasure satisfaction for the pleasure satisfaction of his parents the pleasure satisfaction of his wife children the pleasure satisfaction of his slaves servants assistants and the pleasure satisfaction of his friends he institutes for brahmans contemplatives offerings of supreme aim heavenly resulting in happiness leading to heaven when his wealth is properly put to use kings don t make off with it thieves don t make off with it fire doesn t burn it water doesn t sweep it away and hateful heirs don t make off with it thus his wealth properly put to use goes to a good use and not to waste that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further like water in a haunted place that without being imbibed dries up such is the wealth acquired by a worthless person who neither enjoys it himself nor gives but it s not for sleeping the night garlanded with zodiac stars the night for one who knows is for staying awake if i were to fall from my elephant s shoulder and a tusker trampled me death in battle would be better for me than that i defeated survive thus have i heard at one time the lord was staying near savatthi in the jeta wood at anathapindika s monastery on that occasion the venerable nanda the lord s half brother the son of his maternal aunt informed a number of bhikkhus thus i am discontented with leading the holy life friends i am unable to endure the holy life i will give up the training and return to the low life then a certain bhikkhu approached the lord prostrated himself sat down to one side and said the venerable nanda revered sir the lord s half brother the son of his maternal aunt informed a number of bhikkhus thus i am discontented with leading the holy life i will give up the training and return to the low life then the lord addressed a certain bhikkhu come bhikkhu in my name tell the bhikkhu nanda the teacher calls you friend nanda very well revered sir that bhikkhu replied and approaching the venerable nanda he said the teacher calls you friend nanda very well friend the venerable nanda replied and approaching the lord he prostrated himself and sat down to one side the lord then said to him is it true nanda that you informed a number of bhikkhus thus i am discontented with leading the holy life i will return to the low life yes revered sir but why nanda are you discontented with leading the holy life on departing from home revered sir a sakyan girl the loveliest in the land with her hair half combed looked up at me and said may you return soon master recollecting that revered sir i am discontented with leading the holy life i am unable to endure the holy life i will give up the training and return to the low life then the lord took the venerable nanda by the arm and just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm even so did they vanish from the jeta wood and appear among the devas of the tavatimsa heaven now on that occasion about five hundred pink footed nymphs had come to minister to sakka ruler of the devas and the lord said to the venerable nanda do you see those five hundred pink footed nymphs yes revered sir what do you think nanda who is more beautiful more fair to behold and more alluring that sakyan girl the loveliest in the land or these five hundred pink footed nymphs revered sir compared to these five hundred pink footed nymphs that sakyan girl the loveliest in the land is like a mutilated she monkey that has had its ears and nose chopped off she does not count she is not worth a fraction compared to them there is no comparison these five hundred nymphs are far more beautiful more fair to behold and more alluring rejoice nanda rejoice nanda i guarantee that you will obtain five hundred pink footed nymphs if revered sir the lord guarantees that i will obtain five hundred pink footed nymphs i shall be content in living the holy life under the lord then the lord took the venerable nanda by the arm even so did they vanish from among the devas of the tavatimsa heaven and appear in the jeta wood the bhikkhus heard it is said that the venerable nanda the lord s half brother the son of his maternal aunt is living the holy life for the sake of nymphs it is said that the lord has guaranteed that he will obtain five hundred pink footed nymphs then the bhikkhu friends of the venerable nanda went about calling him hireling and menial saying the venerable nanda is a hireling the venerable nanda is a menial he is living the holy life for the sake of nymphs it is said that the lord has guaranteed that he will obtain five hundred pink footed nymphs then the venerable nanda was humiliated ashamed and dismayed by his friends calling him hireling and menial living alone secluded diligent ardent and resolute he soon realized even here and now through his own direct knowledge that unequalled goal of the holy life for the sake of which sons of good family rightly go forth from home to the homeless state and entering into it he abode in it and he knew finished is birth lived is the holy life done is what had to be done there is no more of this state and the venerable nanda became one of the arahats then when the night was far advanced a certain devata of surpassing beauty illuminating the whole jeta wood approached the lord prostrated himself and stood to one side standing there that devata said to the lord the venerable nanda revered sir the lord s half brother the son of his maternal aunt by the ending of the taints has realized here and now through his own direct knowledge the taintless mind deliverance and wisdom deliverance and entering into it he abides in it the knowledge also arose in the lord nanda by the ending of the taints has realized here and now the taintless mind deliverance and wisdom deliverance and entering into it he abides in it when that night had ended the venerable nanda approached the lord prostrated himself sat down to one side and said to the lord revered sir as to the lord s guarantee that i will obtain five hundred pink footed nymphs i release the lord from that promise but nanda comprehending your mind with my mind i knew nanda has realized here and now the taintless mind deliverance and wisdom deliverance also a devata told me the venerable nanda revered sir has realized here and now the taintless mind deliverance and wisdom deliverance when nanda your mind was released from the taints without grasping i was then released from that promise then on realizing its significance the lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance that bhikkhu who has crossed the mire crushed the thorn of sensual desire and reached the destruction of delusion is not perturbed by pleasures and pains asitaindraasurasmount meru sthe bodhisattalumbinia bull among mensuddhodanabull of the sakyansnalakabull among seersforemost sage nalaka the buddha i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near yes lord the monks replied the blessed one said monks i will teach you the analysis of the six sense media listen and pay close attention i will speak yes lord the monks replied the blessed one said the six internal sense media should be known the six external sense media should be known the six classes of consciousness should be known the six classes of contact should be known the eighteen explorations for the intellect should be known the thirty six states to which beings are attached the thirty six states to which beings are attached should be known thus was it said and in reference to this was it said with regard to them depending on this abandon that thus was it said and in reference to what was it said by depending relying on the six kinds of renunciation joy abandon transcend the six kinds of renunciation distress such is their abandoning such is their transcending by depending relying on the six kinds of renunciation equanimity abandon transcend the six kinds of renunciation joy such is their abandoning such their transcending there is equanimity coming from multiplicity dependent on multiplicity and there is equanimity coming from singleness dependent on singleness and what is equanimity coming from multiplicity dependent on multiplicity there is equanimity with regard to forms equanimity with regard to sounds smells tastes tactile sensations ideas this word appears in one of the recensions this is equanimity coming from multiplicity dependent on multiplicity and what is equanimity coming from singleness dependent on singleness there is equanimity dependent on the dimension of the infinitude of space equanimity dependent on the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness dependent on the dimension of nothingness dependent on the dimension of neither perception nor non perception this is equanimity coming from singleness dependent on singleness by depending relying on equanimity coming from singleness dependent on singleness abandon transcend equanimity coming from multiplicity dependent on multiplicity such is its abandoning such its transcending by depending relying on non fashioning depending on this abandon that thus was it said and in reference to this was it said there is the case where the teacher out of sympathy seeking their well being teaches the dhamma to his disciples this is for your well being this is for your happiness his disciples do not listen or lend ear or apply their minds to gnosis turning aside they stray from the teacher s message in this case the tathagata is not satisfied nor is he sensitive to satisfaction yet he remains untroubled mindful alert this is the first frame of reference that a noble one cultivates cultivating which he is a teacher fit to instruct a group furthermore there is the case where the teacher out of sympathy seeking their well being teaches the dhamma to his disciples this is for your well being this is for your happiness some of his disciples do not listen or lend ear or apply their minds to gnosis turning aside they stray from the teacher s message but some of his disciples listen lend ear apply their minds to gnosis they do not turn aside or stray from the teacher s message in this case the tathagata is not satisfied nor is he sensitive to satisfaction at the same time he is not dissatisfied nor is he sensitive to dissatisfaction free from both satisfaction dissatisfaction he remains equanimous mindful alert this is the second frame of reference furthermore there is the case where the teacher out of sympathy seeking their well being teaches the dhamma to his disciples this is for your well being this is for your happiness his disciples listen lend ear apply their minds to gnosis they do not turn aside or stray from the teacher s message in this case the tathagata is satisfied and is sensitive to satisfaction yet he remains untroubled mindful alert this is the third frame of reference that a noble one cultivates cultivating which he is a teacher fit to instruct a group there are three frames of reference that a noble one cultivates cultivating which he is a teacher fit to instruct a group thus was it said and in reference to this was it said among master trainers he is said to be the unexcelled trainer of those people fit to be tamed thus was it said and in reference to what was it said steered by the elephant trainer the elephant to be tamed runs in only one direction east west north or south steered by the horse trainer the horse to be tamed runs in only one direction east west north or

the blessed one said gratified the monks delighted in the blessed one s words yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said and which craving is the ensnarer that has flowed along spread out and caught hold with which this world is smothered enveloped like a tangled skein a knotted ball of string like matted rushes and reeds and does not go beyond transmigration beyond the planes of deprivation woe bad destinations and which are the craving verbalizations dependent on what is internal there being i am there comes to be i am here there comes to be i am like this i am otherwise i

verbalizations dependent on what is external thus there are craving verbalizations dependent on what is internal and craving verbalizations dependent on what is external these are called the craving verbalizations this monks is craving the ensnarer that has flowed along spread out and caught hold with which this world is smothered enveloped like a tangled skein a knotted ball of string like matted rushes and reeds and does not go beyond transmigration beyond the planes of deprivation woe bad destinations then he went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one just now lord when the king s assembly had gathered and was sitting together in the royal palace this topic of conversation arose money is

the future saying thus it will be in the future or one may talk about now in the present saying thus it is now in the present monks it s through his way of participating in a discussion that a person can be known as fit to talk with or unfit to talk with if a person when asked a question doesn t give a categorical answer to a question deserving a categorical answer doesn t give an analytical qualified answer to a question deserving an analytical answer doesn t give a counter question to a question deserving a counter question doesn t put aside a question deserving to be put aside then that being the case he is a person unfit to talk with but if a person when asked a question gives a categorical answer to a question deserving a categorical answer gives an analytical answer to a question deserving an analytical answer gives a counter question to a question deserving a counter question and puts aside a question deserving to be put aside then that being the case he is a person fit to talk with monks it s through his way of participating in a discussion that a person can be known as fit to talk with or unfit to talk with if a person when asked a question doesn t stand by what is possible and impossible doesn t stand by agreed upon assumptions doesn t stand by teachings known to be true monks it s through his way of participating in a discussion that a person can be known as fit to talk with or unfit to talk with if a person when asked a question wanders from one thing to another pulls the discussion off the topic shows anger aversion and sulks then that being the case he is a person unfit to talk with but if a person when asked a question doesn t wander from one thing to another doesn t pull the discussion off the topic doesn t show anger or aversion or sulk then that being the case he is a person fit to talk with monks it s through his way of participating in a discussion that a person can be known as fit to talk with or unfit to talk with if a person when asked a question puts down the questioner crushes him ridicules him grasps at his little mistakes then that being the case he is a person unfit to talk with but if a person when asked a question doesn t put down the questioner doesn t crush him doesn t ridicule him doesn t grasp at his little mistakes then that being the case he is a person fit to talk with monks it s through his way of participating in a discussion that a person can be known as drawing near or not drawing near one who lends ear draws near one who doesn t lend ear doesn t draw near drawing near one clearly knows one quality comprehends one quality abandons one quality and realizes one quality those who discuss when angered dogmatic arrogant following what s not the noble ones way seeking to expose each other s faults delight in each other s misspoken word slip stumble defeat noble ones don t speak in that way if wise people knowing the right time want to speak then words connected with justice following the ways of the noble ones that s what the enlightened ones speak without anger or arrogance with a mind not boiling over without vehemence without spite without envy they speak from right knowledge they would delight in what s well said and not disparage what s not they don t study to find fault don t grasp at little mistakes don t put down don t crush don t speak random words for the purpose of knowledge for the purpose of inspiring clear confidence counsel that s true that s how noble ones give counsel that s the noble ones counsel knowing this the wise should give counsel without arrogance thus have i heard many deities and men yearning after good have pondered on blessings once upon a time monks a hard shelled tortoise was foraging for food in the evening along the shore of a lake and a jackal was also foraging for food in the evening along the shore of the lake the tortoise saw the jackal from afar foraging for food and so withdrawing its four legs with its neck as a fifth into its own shell it remained perfectly quiet and still but the jackal also saw the tortoise from afar foraging for food and so it went to the tortoise and on arrival hovered around it thinking as soon as the tortoise stretches out one or another of its four limbs or its neck as a fifth i ll seize it right there tear it off and eat it but when the tortoise didn t stretch out any of its four limbs or its neck as a fifth the jackal not having gotten any opportunity lost interest and left in the same way monks on seeing a form with the eye do not grasp at any theme or details by which if you were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail you practice for its restraint guard the faculty of the eye secure your restraint with regard to the faculty of the eye on hearing a sound with the ear on smelling an aroma with the nose on tasting a flavor with the tongue on touching a tactile sensation with the body on cognizing an idea with the intellect do not grasp at any theme or details by which if you were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail you practice for its restraint guard the faculty of the intellect secure your restraint with regard to the faculty of the intellect when you dwell with the doors to your senses well guarded mara not getting any opportunity will lose interest and leave just as the jackal did with the tortoise like a tortoise with its limbs withdrawn in its shell so the monk the thoughts of the heart not dependent harming no others totally unbound he would berate no one if in front or behind there is no one else it s extremely pleasant for one staying alone in the forest come then alone i will go to the wilderness praised by the awakened one pleasant for a resolute monk dwelling alone alone astute in my goal i ll quickly enter the grove refreshing giving rapture to meditators the haunt of elephants in rut when the cool forest s in full flower in a cool mountain gorge having bathed my limbs i ll walk back forth alone ah when will i dwell alone and free from companions in the refreshing great forest my task done fermentation free as i desire to do this may my purpose succeed i myself will bring it about no one can do it for anyone else i myself bind on my armor i will enter the grove and will not emerge without having attained fermentations end while soft breezes blow cool heavily fragrantly scented i ll make ignorance burst as i sit on a mountaintop in the forest covered with blossoms or perhaps on a cool hillside blessed with the bliss of release on giribbaja i ll delight overwhelmed with grief for my son naked demented my hair dishevelled my mind deranged i went about here there living along the side of the road in cemeteries heaps of trash for three full years afflicted with hunger thirst then i saw the one well gone gone to the city of mithila from where have there arisen quarrels disputes lamentation sorrows along with selfishness conceit pride along with divisiveness from where have they arisen please tell me from what is dear there have arisen quarrels disputes lamentation sorrows along with selfishness conceit pride along with divisiveness tied up with selfishness are quarrels disputes in the arising of disputes is divisiveness where is the cause of things dear in the world along with the greeds that go about in the world and where is the cause of the hopes fulfillments for the sake of a person s next life desires are the cause of things dear in the world along with the greeds that go about in the world and it too is the cause of the hopes fulfillments for the sake of a person s next life now where is the cause of desire in the world and from where have there arisen decisions anger lies perplexity and all the qualities described by the contemplative what they call appealing unappealing in the world in dependence on that desire arises having seen becoming not with regard to forms a person gives rise to decisions in the world anger lies perplexity these qualities too when that pair exists a person perplexed should train for the path of knowledge for it s in having known that the contemplative has spoken of qualities dhammas mine nessmine ness at savatthi then early in the morning kisa gotami the nun put on her robes and taking her bowl outer robe went into savatthi for alms when she had gone for alms in savatthi and had returned from her alms round after her meal she went to the grove of the blind to spend the day having gone deep into the grove of the blind she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day s abiding then mara the evil one wanting to arouse fear horripilation terror in her wanting to make her fall away from concentration approached her addressed her in verse why with your sons killed do you sit all alone your face in tears all alone immersed in the midst of the forest are you looking for a man then the thought occurred to kisa gotami the nun now who has recited this verse a human being or a non human one then it occurred to her this is mara the evil one who has recited this verse wanting to arouse fear horripilation terror in me wanting to make me fall away from concentration then having understood that this is mara the evil one she replied to him in verses i ve gotten past the killing of sons have made that the end to my search for men i don t grieve i don t weep and i m not afraid of then mara the evil one sad dejected at realizing kisa gotami the nun knows me vanished right there a quarrelsome bhikkhu shrouded by delusion does not comprehend the dhamma taught by the awakened one when it is revealed annoying those practiced in meditation being led by ignorance he is not aware that his defiled path leads to once carpenter fivetools went to see the how many kinds of feelings reverend udayi were taught by the blessed one after these words carpenter fivetools said not three kinds of feelings reverend udayi were taught by the blessed one it is two kinds of feelings that were stated by the blessed one pleasant and painful feelings the neutral feeling was said by the blessed one to belong to peaceful and sublime happiness but the venerable udayi replied it is not two feelings that were taught by the blessed one but three pleasant painful and neutral feelings this exchange of views was repeated for a second and a third time but neither was carpenter fivetools able to convince the venerable udayi nor could the venerable udayi convince carpenter fivetools it so happened that the venerable ananda had listened to that conversation and went to see the blessed one about it having saluted the blessed one respectfully he sat down at one side thus seated he repeated the entire conversation that had taken place between the venerable udayi and carpenter fivetools the blessed one said ananda udayi s way of presentation with which carpenter fivetools disagreed was correct indeed but also carpenter fivetool s way of presentation with which udayi disagreed was correct in one way of presentation i have spoken of two kinds of feelings and in other ways of presentation i have spoken of three of six of eighteen of thirty six and of one hundred and eight kinds of feelings regarding the dhamma thus shown by me in different ways if there are those who do not agree with do not consent to and do not accept what is rightly said and rightly spoken it may be expected of them that they will quarrel and get into arguments and disputes hurting each other with sharp words regarding the dhamma thus shown by me in different ways if there are those who agree with consent to and accept what is rightly said and rightly spoken it may be expected of them that they will live in concord and amity without dispute like milk that easily mixes with water looking at each other with friendly eyes there are five strands of sense desire what are these five forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desirable agreeable and endearing bound up with sensual desire and tempting to lust sounds cognizable by the ear odors cognizable by the nose flavors cognizable by the tongue tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desirable agreeable and endearing bound up with sense desire and tempting to lust these are the five strands of sense desire the pleasure and joy arising dependent on these five strands of sense desire that is called sensual pleasure if someone were to say this is the highest pleasure that can be experienced i would not concede that and why not because there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime and what is that pleasure here with the stilling of thought conception and discursive thinking a monk enters upon and abides in the second meditative absorption in the sphere of the infinity of space of the infinity of consciousness of no thingness of neither perception nor non perception if someone were to say this is the highest pleasure that can be experienced i would not concede that and why not because there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime and what is this pleasure here by completely surmounting the sphere of neither perception nor non perception a monk enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feeling this is the other kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime it may happen ananda that wanderers of other sects will be saying this the recluse gotama speaks of the cessation of perception and feeling and describes it as pleasure what is this pleasure and how is this a pleasure those who say so should be told the blessed one describes as pleasure not only the feeling of pleasure but a tathagata describes as pleasure whenever and whereinsoever it is obtained thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living at one of right view one of right view is said friends in what way is a noble disciple one of right view whose view is straight who has perfect confidence in the dhamma and has arrived at this true dhamma

the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the awakened one indeed the blessed one is worthy and rightly self awakened consummate in knowledge conduct well gone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the teacher of divine human beings awakened blessed this is the first bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss furthermore the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the dhamma the dhamma is well expounded by the blessed one to be seen here now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselves this is the second bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss furthermore the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified

bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss these are four bonanzas of merit bonanzas of skillfulness nourishments of bliss how is it friend is the eye the fetter it is not friend that the eye is the fetter of visual objects nor are visual objects the fetter of the eye but that based on these two desire and lust it is just as if there were a black and a white ox bound together by one rope or one yoke tie would it be right to say that the black ox is the fetter of the white one or the white one of the black no indeed friend neither the black nor the white ox is the fetter of the other but they are bound together by the same rope or the same yoke tie that is the fetter so too friend the eye is not the fetter of objects nor are objects the fetter of eye the tongue the mind but based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetter if friend the eye were the fetter of visual objects or visual objects were the fetter of the eye if the tongue if the mind were the fetter of thoughts or thoughts were the fetter of mind thus it should be understood that the eye is not the fetter the tongue the mind but that based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetter the blessed one friend has eyes he sees objects with the eye but in the blessed one there is no desire or lust the blessed one s heart is completely liberated the blessed one has a tongue a mind he knows thoughts with the mind but in the blessed one there is no desire or lust the blessed one s heart is completely liberated thus it should be understood that the eye is not the fetter the tongue the mind but that based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetter this swarthy woman preparing a corpse for cremation crow like enormous breaking a thigh then the other thigh breaking an arm then the other arm cracking open the head like a pot of curds she sits with them heaped up beside her whoever unknowing makes acquisitions the fool returns over over to suffering stress so discerning don t make acquisitions may i never lie with my head cracked open again i don t envision a single thing that is as quick to reverse itself as the mind so much so that there is no feasible simile for how quick to reverse itself it is i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near kosamb at ghosita s monastery and on that occasion the inner quarters of king udena s royal park had burned down and women headed by s m vat had died then in the early morning a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and carrying their bowls robes went into kosamb for alms having gone for alms in kosamb after the meal returning from their alms round they went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they said to the blessed one lord the inner quarters of king udena s royal park have burned down and women headed by s m vat have died what is the destination of those female lay followers what is their future course monks among those female lay followers are stream winners once returners non returners all of those female lay followers monks died not without noble fruit then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed bound round with delusion the world only appears to be competent bound with acquisitions foolish surrounded by darkness it seems eternal but for one who sees there is nothing the dhamma protects those who live by the dhamma the dhamma well practiced brings bliss this the reward when the dhamma s well practiced one who lives by the dhamma doesn t go to a bad destination for dhamma and non don t bear equal results non dhamma leads you to hell dhamma to a good destination so you should engender desire for acts of dhamma rejoicing in the one well gone the one who is such standing firm in the dhamma of the foremost one well gone his disciples are guided enlightened to the foremost refuge supreme burst is the root of the boil the net of craving uprooted he having ended his wandering on has no stain like the moon on a clear full moon night endowed with four qualities a monk is incapable of falling away and is right in the presence of unbinding which four there is the case where a monk is consummate in virtue guards the doors to his sense faculties knows moderation in eating is devoted to wakefulness and how is a monk consummate in virtue there is the case where a monk is virtuous he dwells restrained in accordance with the patimokkha consummate in his behavior sphere of activity he trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faults this is how a monk is consummate in virtue and how does a monk guard the doors to his sense faculties there is the case where a monk on seeing a form with the eye does not grasp at any theme or variations by which if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him he practices with restraint he guards the faculty of the eye he achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the eye on hearing a sound with the ear on smelling an aroma with the nose on tasting a flavor with the tongue on feeling a tactile sensation with the body on cognizing an idea with the intellect he does not grasp at any theme or variations by which if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him he practices with restraint he guards the faculty of the intellect he achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the intellect this is how a monk guards the doors to his sense faculties and how does a monk know moderation in eating there is the case where a monk considering it appropriately takes his food not playfully nor for intoxication nor for putting on bulk nor for beautification but simply for the survival continuance of this body for ending its afflictions for the support of the holy life thinking i will destroy old feelings of hunger not create new feelings from overeating thus i will maintain myself be blameless live in comfort this is how a monk knows moderation in eating and how is a monk devoted to wakefulness there is the case where a monk during the day sitting pacing back forth cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check during the first watch of the night endowed with these four qualities a monk is incapable of falling away and is right in the presence of unbinding the monk established in virtue restrained with regard to the sense faculties knowing moderation in food devoted to wakefulness dwelling thus ardently day night untiring he develops skillful qualities for the attainment of rest from the yoke the monk delighting in heedfulness and seeing danger in heedlessness is incapable of falling away is right in the presence of unbinding at savatthi on that occasion ven tissa the blessed one s paternal cousin told a large number of monks friends it s as if my body is drugged i ve lost my bearings things aren t clear to me my mind keeps being overwhelmed with sloth torpor i lead the holy life dissatisfied i have uncertainty about the teachings then a large number of monks went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as they were sitting there they told him lord ven tissa the blessed one s paternal cousin has told a large number of monks friends it s as if my body is drugged i ve lost my bearings things aren t clear to me my mind keeps being overwhelmed with sloth torpor i lead the holy life dissatisfied i have uncertainty about the teachings then the blessed one told a certain monk come monk in my name call tissa saying the teacher calls you my friend as you say lord the monk answered and having gone to ven tissa on arrival he said the teacher calls you my friend as you say my friend ven tissa replied then he went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there the blessed one said to him is it true tissa that you have told a large number of monks friends it s as if my body is drugged i ve lost my bearings things aren t clear to me my mind keeps being overwhelmed with sloth torpor i lead the holy life dissatisfied i have uncertainty about the teachings yes lord what do you think tissa in one who is not without passion desire love thirst fever craving for form does there arise sorrow lamentation pain distress despair from change alteration in his form yes lord good tissa good that s how it is for one who is not without passion for form what do you think tissa in one who is not without passion desire love thirst fever craving for feeling perception fabrications does there arise sorrow lamentation pain distress despair from change alteration in his fabrications yes lord good tissa good that s how it is for one who is not without passion for fabrications what do you think tissa in one who is not without passion desire love thirst fever craving for consciousness does there arise sorrow lamentation pain distress despair from change alteration in his consciousness yes lord good tissa good that s how it is for one who is not without passion for consciousness now what do you think tissa in one who is without passion desire love thirst fever craving for form does there arise sorrow lamentation pain distress despair from change alteration in his form no lord good tissa good that s how it is for one who is without passion for form what do you think tissa in one who is without passion desire love thirst fever craving for feeling perception fabrications does there arise sorrow lamentation pain distress despair from change alteration in his fabrications no lord good tissa good that s how it is for one who is without passion for fabrications what do you think tissa in one who is without passion desire love thirst fever craving for consciousness does there arise sorrow lamentation pain distress despair from change alteration in his consciousness no lord good tissa good that s how it is for one who is without passion for consciousness what do you think tissa is form constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord is feeling constant or inconstant inconstant lord is perception constant or inconstant inconstant lord are fabrications constant or inconstant inconstant lord what do you think tissa is consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord thus tissa any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am any feeling whatsoever any perception whatsoever any fabrications whatsoever any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness through disenchantment he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is fully released with full release there is the knowledge fully released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world i have made this comparison tissa to convey a meaning the meaning is this the man unskilled in the path stands for a run of the mill person the man skilled in the path stands for the tathagata worthy rightly self awakened the fork in the road stands for uncertainty the left fork stands for the eightfold wrong path i e wrong view wrong resolve wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness wrong concentration the right fork stands for the noble eightfold path i e right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration the intense forest grove stands for ignorance the large marshy swamp stands for sensual desires the deep drop off stands for anger despair the delightful stretch of level ground stands for unbinding rejoice tissa rejoice i am here to exhort you i am here to aid you i am here to instruct you that is what the blessed one said gratified ven tissa delighted in the blessed one s words the sage has emphasized and praised noble friendship for the world if one stays with a noble friend even a fool will become a wise person stay with them of good heart for the wisdom of those who

out first and then i go now when they have scrubbed off the dirt mud are well bathed well perfumed have trimmed their hair and beards and have put on white clothes they will go about endowed and provided with the five strings of sensuality then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed one should not make an effort everywhere should not be another s hireling should not live dependent on another should not go about as a trader in the dhamma see also i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near this is not the time for a question kassapa we have entered among houses a second time a third time kassapa the clothless ascetic said to him we would like to question master gotama about a certain point if he would take the time to answer our question this is not the time for a question kassapa we have entered among houses when this was said kassapa the clothless ascetic said what we want to ask isn t much then ask as you like master gotama is stress self made don t say that kassapa then is it other made don t say that kassapa then is it both self made and other made don t say that kassapa then is it the case that stress being neither self made nor other made arises spontaneously don t say that kassapa then does stress not exist it s not the case kassapa that stress does not exist stress does exist well in that case does master gotama not know or see stress kassapa it s not the case that i don t know or see stress i know stress i see stress now when asked is stress self made you say don t say that kassapa when asked then is it other made you say don t say that kassapa when asked then is it both self made and other made you say don t say that kassapa when asked then is it the case that stress being neither self made nor other made arises spontaneously you say don t say that kassapa when asked then does stress not exist you say it s not the case kassapa that stress does not exist stress does exist when asked well in that case does master gotama not know or see stress you say kassapa it s not the case that i don t know or see stress i know stress i see stress then explain stress to me lord blessed one teach me about stress lord blessed one the one who acts is the one who experiences the result of the act amounts to the eternalist statement existing from the very beginning stress is self made the one who acts is someone other than the one who experiences from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications now from the remainderless fading cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications from the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness from the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name form from the cessation of name form comes the cessation of the six sense media from the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact from the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling from the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving from the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging sustenance from the cessation of clinging sustenance comes the cessation of becoming from the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth from the cessation of birth then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair all cease such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress suffering anyone kassapa who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires the going forth admission in this doctrine discipline must first undergo probation for four months if at the end of four months the monks feel so moved they give him the going forth admit him to the monk s state but i know distinctions among individuals in this matter lord if that is so i am willing to undergo probation for four years if at the end of four years the monks feel so moved let them give me the going forth admit me to the monk s state i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion ven s riputta was sitting not far from the blessed one his legs crossed his body held erect modest content solitary unentangled his persistence aroused devoted to the heightened mind the blessed one saw ven s riputta sitting not far away his legs crossed his body held erect modest content solitary unentangled his persistence aroused devoted to the heightened mind then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed of heightened awareness heedful the sage trained in sagacity s way he has no sorrows one who is such calmed ever mindful then given that the blessed one has declared lord that bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct should not be done what drawbacks can one expect when doing what should not be done given that i have declared ananda that bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct should not be done these are the drawbacks one can expect when doing what should not be done one can fault oneself observant people on close examination criticize one one s bad reputation gets spread about one dies confused and on the break up of the body after death one reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell given that i have declared ananda that bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct should not be done these are the drawbacks one can expect when doing what should not be done i say categorically ananda that good bodily conduct good verbal conduct good mental conduct should be done given that the blessed one has declared lord that good bodily conduct good verbal conduct good mental conduct should be done what rewards can one expect when doing what should be done given that i have declared ananda that good bodily conduct good verbal conduct good mental conduct should be done these are the rewards one can expect when doing what should be done one doesn t fault oneself observant people on close examination praise one one s good reputation gets spread about one dies unconfused and on the break up of the body after death one reappears in the good destinations in the heavenly world given that i have declared ananda that good bodily conduct good verbal conduct good mental conduct should be done these are the rewards one can expect when doing what should be done monks i will teach you the all listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said what is the all simply the eye forms ear sounds nose aromas tongue flavors body tactile sensations intellect ideas this monks is called the all i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near that s the way it is ananda when young one is subject to aging when healthy subject to illness when alive subject to death the complexion is no longer so clear bright the limbs are flabby wrinkled the back bent forward there s a discernible change in the faculties the faculty of the eye the faculty of the ear the faculty of the nose the faculty of the tongue the faculty of the body that is what the blessed one said having said that the one well gone the teacher said further i spit kamada buddha kamada buddha kamada buddha kamada buddha rohini s father rohini rohini s father our rohini rohini s father jtb ag calls this sutta iii i follow pts numbering and call it iii on one occasion the blessed one was staying near indeed brahmans you are feeble old men aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life years old and you have done no admirable deeds no skillful deeds no deeds that allay your fears this world is on fire with aging illness death with the world thus on fire with aging illness death any restraint of body speech intellect practiced here will be one s shelter cave island refuge after death in the world beyond when a house is on fire the vessel salvaged is the one that will be of use not the one left there to burn so when the world is on fire with aging death one should salvage one s wealth by giving what s given is well salvaged whoever here is restrained in body speech awareness who makes merit while he s alive that will be for his bliss after death on one occasion many elder monks were staying near when this was said the elder monks said to ven channa form friend channa is inconstant feeling is inconstant perception is inconstant fabrications are inconstant consciousness is inconstant form is not self feeling is not self perception is not self fabrications are not self consciousness is not self all fabrications are inconstant all phenomena are not self then the thought occurred to ven channa i too think that form is inconstant feeling is inconstant perception is inconstant fabrications are inconstant consciousness is inconstant form is not self feeling is not self perception is not self fabrications are not self consciousness is not self all fabrications are inconstant all phenomena are not self but still my mind does not leap up grow confident steadfast releasedthen the thought occurred to ven channa this so setting his lodgings in order and carrying his robes bowl ven channa went to kosambi to where ven ananda was staying in ghosita s park on arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with the ven ananda after an exchange of friendly greetings courtesies he sat to one side as he was sitting there he told ven ananda what had happened and added may ven ananda exhort me may ven ananda teach me may ven ananda give me a dhamma talk so that i might see the dhamma even this much makes me feel gratified satisfied with ven channa that he opens up breaks down his stubbornness so lend ear friend channa you are capable of understanding the dhamma then a sudden great rapture joy welled up in ven channa at the thought so i am capable of understanding the dhamma face to face with the blessed one have i heard this friend channa face to face with him have i learned the exhortation he gave to the bhikkhu by large kaccayana this world is in bondage to attachments clingings sustenances biases but one such as this does not get involved with or cling to these attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases or obsessions nor is he resolved on my self he has no uncertainty or doubt that when there is arising only stress is arising and that when there is passing away stress is passing away in this one s knowledge is independent of others it is to this extent kaccayana that there is right view everything exists that is one extreme everything doesn t exist that is a second extreme avoiding these two extremes the tathagata teaches the dhamma via the middle from ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications from fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name form from name form as a requisite condition come the six sense media from the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact from contact as a requisite condition comes feeling from feeling as a requisite condition comes craving from craving as a requisite condition comes clinging sustenance from clinging sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth from birth as a requisite condition then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair come into play such is the origination of this entire mass of stress suffering now from the remainderless fading cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications from the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness from the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name form from the cessation of name form comes the cessation of the six sense media from the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact from the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling from the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving from the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging sustenance from the cessation of clinging sustenance comes the cessation of becoming from the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth from the cessation of birth then aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress despair all cease such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress suffering that s how it is friend ananda for those who have friends in the holy life like ven ananda sympathetic helpful exhorting teaching just now for me listening to ven ananda s dhamma teaching has the dhamma been penetrated i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at form monks is not self if form were the self this form would not lend itself to dis ease it would be possible to say with regard to form let this form be thus let this form not be thus but precisely because form is not self form lends itself to dis ease and it is not possible to say with regard to form let this form be thus let this form not be thus feeling is not self perception is not self mental fabrications are not self consciousness is not self if consciousness were the self this consciousness would not lend itself to dis ease it would be possible to say with regard to consciousness let my consciousness be thus let my consciousness not be thus but precisely because consciousness is not self consciousness lends itself to dis ease and it is not possible to say with regard to consciousness let my consciousness be thus let my consciousness not be thus what do you think monks is form constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord is feeling constant or inconstant inconstant lord is perception constant or inconstant inconstant lord are fabrications constant or inconstant inconstant lord what do you think monks is consciousness constant or inconstant inconstant lord and is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful stressful lord and is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as this is mine this is my self this is what i am no lord thus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am any feeling whatsoever any perception whatsoever any fabrications whatsoever any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as this is not mine this is not my self this is not what i am seeing thus the well instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness disenchanted he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is fully released with full release there is the knowledge fully released he discerns that birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done there is nothing further for this world that is what the blessed one said gratified the group of five monks delighted at his words i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near there are these five clinging aggregates friend visakha form as a clinging aggregate feeling as a clinging aggregate perception as a clinging aggregate fabrications as a clinging aggregate consciousness as a clinging aggregate these five clinging aggregates are the self identification described by the blessed one saying yes lady visakha the lay follower delighted rejoiced in what dhammadinna the nun had said then he asked her a further question the origination of self identification the origination of self identification it is said lady which origination of self identification is described by the blessed one the craving that makes for further becoming accompanied by passion delight relishing now here now there i e craving for sensual pleasure craving for becoming craving for non becoming this friend visakha is the origination of self identification described by the blessed one the cessation of self identification the cessation of self identification it is said lady which cessation of self identification is described by the blessed one the remainderless fading cessation renunciation relinquishment release letting go of that very craving this friend visakha is the cessation of self identification described by the blessed one the way of practice leading to the cessation of self identification the way of practice leading to the cessation of self identification it is said lady which way of practice leading to the cessation of self identification is described by the blessed one precisely this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration this friend visakha is the way of practice leading to the cessation of self identification described by the blessed one is it the case lady that clinging is the same thing as the five clinging aggregates or is it something separate friend visakha neither is clinging the same thing as the five clinging aggregates nor is it something separate whatever desire passion there is with regard to the five clinging aggregates that is the clinging there but lady how does self identification come about there is the case friend visakha where an uninstructed run of the mill person who has no regard for noble ones is not well versed or disciplined in their dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not well versed or disciplined in their dhamma assumes form the body to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form he assumes feeling to be the self he assumes perception to be the self he assumes mental fabrications to be the self he assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness this is how self identification comes about but lady how does self identification not come about there is the case where a well instructed disciple of the noble ones who has regard for noble ones is well versed disciplined in their dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is well versed disciplined in their dhamma does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form he does not assume feeling to be the self he does not assume perception to be the self he does not assume fabrications to be the self he does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness this is how self identification does not come about now again lady what is the noble eightfold path this is the noble eightfold path friend visakha right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration is the noble eightfold path fabricated or unfabricated the noble eightfold path is fabricated the three aggregates are not included under the noble eightfold path friend visakha but the noble eightfold path is included under the three aggregates right speech right action right livelihood come under the aggregate of virtue right effort right mindfulness right concentration come under the aggregate of concentration right view right resolve come under the aggregate of discernment now what is concentration lady what qualities are its themes what qualities are its requisites and what is its development singleness of mind is concentration friend visakha the four frames of reference are its themes the four right exertions are its requisites and any cultivation development pursuit of these qualities is its development now lady what are fabrications these three fabrications friend visakha bodily fabrications verbal fabrications mental fabrications but what are bodily fabrications what are verbal fabrications what are mental fabrications in out breaths are bodily fabrications directed thought evaluation are verbal fabrications perceptions feelings are mental fabrications but why are in out breaths bodily fabrications why are directed thought evaluation verbal fabrications why are perceptions feelings mental fabrications in out breaths are bodily these are things tied up with the body that s why in out breaths are bodily fabrications having first directed one s thoughts and made an evaluation one then breaks out into speech that s why directed thought evaluation are verbal fabrications perceptions feelings are mental these are things tied up with the mind that s why perceptions feelings are mental fabrications now lady how does the attainment of the cessation of perception feeling come about the thought does not occur to a monk as he is attaining the cessation of perception feeling that i am about to attain the cessation of perception feeling or that i am attaining the cessation of perception feeling or that i have attained the cessation of perception feeling instead the way his mind has previously been developed leads him to that state but when a monk is attaining the cessation of perception feeling which things cease first bodily fabrications verbal fabrications or mental fabrications when a monk is attaining the cessation of perception feeling friend visakha verbal fabrications cease first then bodily fabrications then mental fabrications now lady how does emergence from the cessation of perception feeling come about the thought does not occur to a monk as he is emerging from the cessation of perception feeling that i am about to emerge from the cessation of perception feeling or that i am emerging from the cessation of perception feeling or that i have emerged from the cessation of perception feeling instead the way his mind has previously been developed leads him to that state but when a monk is emerging from the cessation of perception feeling which things arise first bodily fabrications verbal fabrications or mental fabrications when a monk is emerging from the cessation of perception feeling friend visakha mental fabrications arise first then bodily fabrications then verbal fabrications when a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception feeling lady how many contacts make contact when a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception feeling friend visakha three contacts make contact contact with emptiness contact with the signless contact with the undirected when a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception feeling lady to what does his mind lean to what does it tend to what does it incline when a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception feeling friend visakha his mind leans to seclusion tends to seclusion inclines to seclusion now lady how many kinds of feeling are there these three kinds of feeling pleasant feeling painful feeling neither pleasant nor painful feeling what is pleasant feeling what is painful feeling what is neither pleasant nor painful feeling whatever is experienced physically or mentally as pleasant gratifying is pleasant feeling whatever is experienced physically or mentally as painful hurting is painful feeling whatever is experienced physically or mentally as neither gratifying nor hurting is neither pleasant nor painful feeling in what way is pleasant feeling pleasant lady and in what way painful pleasant feeling is pleasant in remaining painful in changing friend visakha painful feeling is painful in remaining pleasant in changing neither pleasant nor painful feeling is pleasant in occurring together with knowledge and painful in occurring without knowledge what obsession gets obsessed with pleasant feeling what obsession gets obsessed with painful feeling what obsession gets obsessed with neither pleasant nor painful feeling passion obsession gets obsessed with pleasant feeling resistance obsession gets obsessed with painful feeling ignorance obsession gets obsessed with neither pleasant nor painful feeling does passion obsession get obsessed with all pleasant feeling does resistance obsession get obsessed with all painful feeling does ignorance obsession get obsessed with all neither pleasant nor painful feeling no but what is to be abandoned with regard to pleasant feeling what is to be abandoned with regard to painful feeling what is to be abandoned with regard to neither pleasant nor painful feeling passion obsession is to be abandoned with regard to pleasant feeling resistance obsession is to be abandoned with regard to painful feeling ignorance obsession is to be abandoned with regard to neither pleasant nor painful feeling is passion obsession to be abandoned with regard to all pleasant feeling is resistance obsession to be abandoned with regard to all painful feeling is ignorance obsession to be abandoned with regard to all neither pleasant nor painful feeling no there is the case where a monk quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought evaluation with that he abandons passion no passion obsession gets obsessed there passion lies on the other side of pleasant feeling and what lies on the other side of painful feeling resistance lies on the other side of painful feeling what lies on the other side of neither pleasant nor painful feeling ignorance lies on the other side of neither pleasant nor painful feeling what lies on the other side of ignorance clear knowing lies on the other side of ignorance what lies on the other side of clear knowing release lies on the other side of clear knowing what lies on the other side of release unbinding lies on the other side of release you ve gone too far friend visakha you can t keep holding on up to the limit of questions for the holy life gains a footing in unbinding culminates in unbinding has unbinding as its final end if you wish go to the blessed one and ask him the meaning of these things whatever he says that s how you should remember it then visakha the lay follower delighting rejoicing in what dhammadinna the nun had said bowed down to her and keeping her to his right went to the blessed one on arrival having bowed down to the blessed one he sat to one side as he was sitting there he told the blessed one the full extent of the conversation he had had with dhammadinna the nun when this was said the blessed one said to him dhammadinna the nun is wise visakha a woman of great discernment if you had asked me those things i would have answered you in the same way she did that is the meaning of those things that is how you should remember it that is what the blessed one said gratified visakha the lay follower delighted in the blessed one s words having admirable friends has been praised by the sage with reference to the world associating with an admirable friend even a fool becomes wise people of integrity should be associated with in that way discernment grows associating with people of integrity one would be released from all suffering stress would know stress the origination of stress cessation the eightfold path the four noble truths stressful painful is the woman s state so says the tamer of tamable people being a co wife is painful some on giving birth once slit their throats others of delicate constitution take poison in the midst of a breech birth both mother child suffer destruction going along about to give birth i saw my husband dead giving birth in the road i hadn t reached my own home two children deceased my husband dead in the road miserable me my mother father brother were burning on a single pyre your family all gone miserable you ve suffered pain without measure your tears have flowed for many thousands of lives i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion most of the people in s vatth were excessively attached to sensual pleasures they lived infatuated with greedy for addicted to fastened to absorbed in sensual pleasures then early in the morning the blessed one adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl robes went into s vatth for alms he saw that most of the people in s vatth were excessively attached to sensual pleasures that they live infatuated with greedy for addicted to fastened to absorbed in sensual pleasures then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed blinded by sensuality covered by the net veiled with the veil of craving bound by the kinsman of the heedless i tell you the ending of the mental fermentations depends on the first jhana the second jhana the third the fourth the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness i tell you the ending of the mental fermentations depends on the dimension of neither perception nor non perception i tell you the ending of the mental fermentations depends on the first jhana thus it has been said in reference to what was it said there is the case where a monk secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities enters remains in the first jhana rapture pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought evaluation he regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness not self he turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness this is peace this is exquisite the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation unbinding staying right there he reaches the ending of the mental fermentations or if not then through this very dhamma passion this very dhamma delight and from the total wasting away of the first five of the fetters i tell you the ending of the mental fermentations depends on the first jhana thus was it said and in reference to this was it said i tell you the ending of the mental fermentations depends on the dimension of the infinitude of space thus it has been said in reference to what was it said there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of perceptions of physical form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity perceiving infinite space enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space he regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with feeling perception fabrications consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness not self he turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness this is peace this is exquisite the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation unbinding suppose that an archer or archer s apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession and to pierce great masses in the same way there is the case where a monk enters remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space he regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with feeling perception fabrications consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness not self he turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness this is peace this is exquisite the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation unbinding staying right there he reaches the ending of the mental fermentations or if not then through this very dhamma passion this very dhamma delight and from the total wasting away of the first five of the fetters he is due to be reborn in the pure abodes there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world i tell you the ending of the mental fermentations depends on the dimension of the infinitude of space thus was it said and in reference to this was it said similarly with the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness and the dimension of nothingness thus as far as the perception attainments go that is as far as gnosis penetration goes as for these two dimensions the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor non perception the attainment of the cessation of feeling perception i tell you that they are to be rightly explained by those monks who are meditators skilled in attaining skilled in attaining emerging who have attained emerged in dependence on them alternate translation this was said by the lord living with brahma are those families where within the home mother and father are respected by their children living with the early devas are those families where within the home mother and father are respected by their children living with the early teachers are those families where within the home mother and father are respected by their children living with those worthy of adoration are those families where within the home mother and father are respected by their children brahma bhikkhus is a term for mother and father early devas and early teachers and those worthy of veneration are terms for mother and father for what reason because mother and father are very helpful to their children they take care of them and bring them up and teach them about the world mother and father are called brahma early teachers and worthy of veneration being compassionate towards their family of children thus the wise should venerate them pay them due honor provide them with food and drink give them clothing and a bed anoint and bathe them and also wash their feet when he performs such service for his mother and his father they praise that wise person even here and hereafter he rejoices in heaven monks there are these four modes of practice which four intolerant practice tolerant practice self controlled practice and even practice and which is intolerant practice there is the case where a certain individual doesn t tolerate cold heat hunger thirst the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun reptiles ill spoken unwelcome words bodily feelings that when they arise are painful racking sharp piercing disagreeable displeasing menacing to life this is called intolerant practice and which is tolerant practice there is the case where a certain individual tolerates cold heat hunger thirst the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun reptiles ill spoken unwelcome words bodily feelings that when they arise are painful racking sharp piercing disagreeable displeasing menacing to life this is called tolerant practice and which is self controlled practice there is the case where a monk on seeing a form with the eye doesn t grasp at any theme or variations by which if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him he practices with restraint he guards the faculty of the eye he achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the eye on hearing a sound with the ear on smelling an aroma with the nose on tasting a flavor with the tongue on touching a tactile sensation with the body on cognizing an idea with the intellect he doesn t grasp at any theme or variations by which if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him he practices with restraint he guards the faculty of the intellect he achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the intellect this is called self controlled practice and which is even practice there is the case where a monk doesn t acquiesce to an arisen thought of sensuality he abandons it destroys it dispels it knows it he doesn t acquiesce to an arisen thought of ill will he abandons it dispels it knows it demolishes it wipes it out of existence he doesn t acquiesce to an arisen thought of harmfulness he abandons it dispels it knows it demolishes it wipes it out of existence he doesn t acquiesce to any arisen evil unskillful qualities he abandons them dispels them knows them demolishes them wipes them out of existence this is called even practice these monks are four modes of practice i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near s vatth at jeta s grove an thapi ika s monastery and on that occasion king pasenadi kosala had gone with queen mallik to the upper palace then he said to her mallik is there anyone dearer to you than yourself no great king there is no one dearer to me than myself and what about you great king is there anyone dearer to you than yourself no mallik there is no one dearer to me than myself then the king descending from the palace went to the blessed one and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side as he was sitting there he said to the blessed one just now when i had gone with queen mallik to the upper palace i said to her mallik is there anyone dearer to you than yourself when this was said she said to me no great king there is no one dearer to me than myself and what about you great king is there anyone dearer to you than yourself when this was said i said to her no mallik there is no one dearer to me than myself then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed searching all directions with your awareness you find no one dearer than yourself in the same way others are thickly dear to themselves so you shouldn t hurt others if you love yourself i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying near r jagaha at the bamboo grove the squirrels sanctuary and on that occasion ven mah kassapa was staying at the pipphali cave sitting for seven days in a single session having attained a certain level of concentration then with the passing of seven days he emerged from that concentration to him emerging from that concentration the thought occurred what if i were to go into r jagaha for alms now on that occasion devat s were in a state of eagerness for the chance to give alms to ven mah kassapa but ven mah kassapa turning down those devat s early in the morning adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl robes went into r jagaha for alms now on that occasion sakka the deva king wanted to give alms to ven mah kassapa so assuming the appearance of a weaver he was working a loom while suj t an asura maiden filled the shuttle then as ven mah kassapa was going on an almsround that bypassed no donorsthe thought occurred to ven mah kassapa now who is this being with such power might as this then the thought occurred to him this is sakka the deva king isn t it on realizing this he said to sakka is this your doing kosiya we too need merit ven kassapa we too have use for merit then bowing down to ven mah kassapa and circling him to the right sakka rose up into the air and while up in the sky exclaimed three times the blessed one with his divine hearing property surpassing that of the human heard sakka the deva king while up in the sky exclaiming three times on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed the monk going for alms supporting himself and no other the devas adore one who is such calmed ever mindful i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at uruvel on the bank of the nera jar river at the root of the bodhi tree the tree of awakening newly awakened and on that occasion he sat at the root of the bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of release then with the passing of seven days after emerging from that concentration in the second watch of the night he gave close attention to dependent co arising in reverse order when this isn t that isn t in other words from the cessation of ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed as phenomena grow clear to the brahman ardent in jh na his doubts all vanish when he penetrates the ending of requisite conditions when the deva has rained and the grass is tall and the forest s a shimmering cloud of blossoms i ll sit on a stump in the heart of the hills and to me that will seem as soft as cotton thus have i heard on one occasion the blessed one was living at then then listen student and heed well what i shall say even so master gotama subha the student replied the blessed one said this i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was living among the yes lord the monks responded the blessed one said no lord i have given you this parable to convey a meaning the meaning is this the bowl filled to the brim with oil stands for mindfulness immersed in the body thus you should train yourselves we will develop mindfulness immersed in the body we will pursue it hand it the reins and take it as a basis give it a grounding steady it consolidate it and undertake it well that is how you should train yourselves having been given leave by the blessed one sakka the deva king asked him his first question fettered with what dear sir though they think may we live free from hostility free from violence free from rivalry free from ill will free from those who are hostile do devas human beings asuras nagas gandhabbas whatever other many kinds of beings there are nevertheless live in hostility violence rivalry ill will with those who are hostile thus sakka asked his first question of the blessed one and the blessed one when asked replied devas human beings asuras nagas gandhabbas whatever other many kinds of beings there are are fettered with envy stinginess which is why even though they think may we live free from hostility free from violence free from rivalry free from ill will free from those who are hostile they nevertheless live in hostility violence rivalry ill will with those who are hostile thus the blessed one answered having been asked by sakka the deva king gratified sakka was delighted in expressed his approval of the blessed one s words so it is o blessed one so it is o one well gone hearing the blessed one s answer to my question my doubt is now cut off my perplexity is overcome then sakka having delighted in expressed his approval of the blessed one s words asked him a further question but what dear sir is the cause of envy stinginess what is their origination what gives them birth what is their source when what exists do they come into being when what doesn t exist do they not envy stinginess have dear not dear as their cause have dear not dear as their origination have dear not dear as what gives them birth have dear not dear as their source when dear not dear exist they come into being when dear not dear are not they don t but what dear sir is the cause of dear not dear what is their

origination have desire as what gives them birth have desire as their source when desire exists they come into being when desire is not they don t but what dear sir is the cause of desire what is its origination what gives it birth what is its source when what exists does it come into being when what doesn t exist does it not desire has thinking as its cause has thinking as its origination has thinking as what gives it birth has thinking as its source when thinking exists desire comes into being when thinking is not it doesn t but what dear sir is the cause of thinking what is its origination what gives it birth what is its source when what exists does it come into being when what doesn t exist does it not and how has he practiced dear sir the monk who has practiced the practice leading to the right cessation of the perceptions categories of objectification joy is of two sorts i tell you deva king to be pursued not to be pursued thus was it said and in reference to what was it said when one knows of a feeling of joy as i pursue this joy unskillful mental qualities increase and skillful mental qualities decline that sort of joy is not to be pursued when one knows of a feeling of joy as i pursue this joy unskillful mental qualities decline and skillful mental qualities increase that sort of joy is to be pursued and this sort of joy may be accompanied by directed thought evaluation or free of directed thought evaluation of the two the latter is the more refined joy is of two sorts i tell you deva king to be pursued not to be pursued thus was it said and in reference to this was it said this is how he has practiced deva king the monk who has practiced the practice leading to the right cessation of the perceptions categories of objectification thus the blessed one answered having been asked by sakka the deva king gratified sakka was delighted in expressed his approval of the blessed one s words so it is o blessed one so it is o one well gone hearing the blessed one s answer to my question my doubt is now cut off my perplexity is overcome then sakka having delighted in expressed his approval of the blessed one s words asked him a further question but how has he practiced dear sir the monk who has practiced for restraint in the patimokkha bodily conduct is of two sorts i tell you deva king to be pursued not to be pursued thus was it said and in reference to what was it said when one knows of bodily conduct as i pursue this bodily conduct unskillful mental qualities increase and skillful mental qualities decline that sort of bodily conduct is not to be pursued when one knows of bodily conduct as i pursue this bodily conduct unskillful mental qualities decline and skillful mental qualities increase that sort of bodily conduct is to be pursued bodily conduct is of two sorts i tell you deva king to be pursued not to be pursued thus was it said and in reference to this was it said this is how he has practiced deva king the monk who has practiced the practice for restraint in the patimokkha thus the blessed one answered having been asked by sakka the deva king gratified sakka was delighted in expressed his approval of the blessed one s words so it is o blessed one so it is o one well gone hearing the blessed one s answer to my question my doubt is now cut off my perplexity is overcome then sakka having delighted in expressed his approval of the blessed one s words asked him a further question but how has he practiced dear sir the monk who has practiced for restraint with regard to the sense faculties when this was said sakka the deva king said to the blessed one dear sir i understand the detailed meaning of the blessed one s brief statement if as one pursues a certain type of form cognizable by the eye unskillful mental qualities increase and skillful mental qualities decline that sort of form cognizable by the eye is not to be pursued but if as one pursues a certain type of form cognizable by the eye unskillful mental qualities decline and skillful mental qualities increase that sort of form cognizable by the eye is to be pursued if as one pursues a certain type of sound cognizable by the ear if as one pursues a certain type of aroma cognizable by the nose if as one pursues a certain type of flavor cognizable by the tongue if as one pursues a certain type of tactile sensation cognizable by the body if as one pursues a certain type of idea cognizable by the intellect unskillful mental qualities increase and skillful mental qualities decline that sort of idea cognizable by the intellect is not to be pursued but if as one pursues a certain type of idea cognizable by the intellect unskillful mental qualities decline and skillful mental qualities increase that sort of idea cognizable by the intellect is to be pursued this is how i understand the detailed meaning of the blessed one s brief statement hearing the blessed one s answer to my question my doubt is now cut off my perplexity is overcome no deva king not all brahmans contemplatives teach the same doctrine adhere to the same precepts desire the same thing aim at the same goal why dear sir don t all brahmans contemplatives teach the same doctrine adhere to the same precepts desire the same thing aim at the same goal the world is made up of many properties various properties because of the many various properties in the world then whichever property living beings get fixated on they become entrenched latch onto it saying only this is true anything else is worthless this is why not all brahmans contemplatives teach the same doctrine adhere to the same precepts desire the same thing aim at the same goal but dear sir are all brahmans contemplatives utterly complete utterly free from bonds followers of the utterly holy life utterly consummate no deva king not all brahmans contemplatives are utterly complete utterly free from bonds followers of the utterly holy life utterly consummate but why dear sir are not all brahmans contemplatives utterly complete utterly free from bonds followers of the utterly holy life utterly consummate those monks who are released through the total ending of craving are the ones who are utterly complete utterly free from bonds followers of the utterly holy life utterly consummate this is why not all brahmans contemplatives are utterly complete utterly free from bonds followers of the utterly holy life utterly consummate thus the blessed one answered having been asked by sakka the deva king gratified sakka was delighted in expressed his approval of the blessed one s words so it is o blessed one so it is o one well gone hearing the blessed one s answer to my question my doubt is now cut off my perplexity is overcome then sakka having delighted in expressed his approval of the blessed one s words said to him yearning is a disease yearning is a boil yearning is an arrow it seduces one drawing one into this or that state of being which is why one is reborn in high states low whereas other outside brahmans contemplatives gave me no chance to ask them these questions the blessed one has answered at length so that he has removed the arrow of my uncertainty perplexity deva king do you recall having asked other brahmans contemplatives these questions yes lord i recall having asked other brahmans contemplatives these questions if it s no inconvenience could you tell me how they answered it s no inconvenience when sitting with the blessed one or one who is like him then tell me deva king having gone to those whom i considered to be brahmans contemplatives living in isolated dwellings in the wilderness i asked them these questions but when asked by me they were at a loss being at a loss they asked being asked i responded i dear sir am sakka the deva king so they questioned me further but what kamma did you do to attain to this state so i taught them the dhamma as far as i had heard mastered it and they were gratified with just this much we have seen sakka the deva king and he has answered our questions so instead of my becoming their disciple they simply became mine but i lord am the blessed one s disciple a stream winner steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for self awakening deva king do you recall ever having previously experienced such happiness joy yes lord i do and how do you recall ever having previously experienced such happiness joy once lord the devas asuras were arrayed in battle and in that battle the devas won while the asuras lost having won the battle as the victor in the battle this thought occurred to me whatever has been the divine nourishment of the asuras whatever has been the divine nourishment of the devas the devas will now enjoy both of them but my attainment of happiness joy was in the sphere of violence weapons it didn t lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to self awakening to unbinding but my attainment of happiness joy on hearing the blessed one s dhamma is in the sphere of no violence the sphere of no weapons it leads to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to self awakening to unbinding such were the questions that the blessed one answered at sakka s bidding and so this discourse is called sakka s questions and how monks does a monk cultivate the heart s release by loving kindness in this case monks a monk cultivates the enlightenment factor of mindfulness accompanied by loving kindness and similarly the enlightenment factors of investigation of states energy rapture tranquillity concentration equanimity accompanied by loving kindness which is based on detachment dispassion leading to maturity of surrender if he wishes to dwell perceiving the repulsive in what is not repulsive he dwells thus perceiving the repulsive if he wishes to dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in what is repulsive he dwells thus perceiving the unrepulsive if he wishes to dwell perceiving the repulsive both in what is repulsive and what is not repulsive if he wishes to dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in both he dwells thus if he wishes avoiding both the repulsive and unrepulsive to dwell equanimous and how monks does a monk cultivate release by compassion what is its goal its excellence its fruit and its outcome in this monks a monk cultivates the enlightenment factors of mindfulness equanimity accompanied by compassion and how monks does a monk cultivate the heart s release by sympathetic joy what is its goal its excellence its fruit and its outcome in this monks a monk cultivates the enlightenment factors of mindfulness equanimity accompanied by sympathetic joy and how monks does a monk cultivate the heart s release by equanimity what is its goal its excellence its fruit and its outcome in this case monks a monk cultivates the enlightenment factors of mindfulness investigation of states energy rapture tranquillity concentration equanimity accompanied by equanimity i have heard that on one occasion the blessed one was staying at uruvel on the bank of the nera jar river at the root of the muccalinda tree newly awakened and on that occasion he sat for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of release and on that occasion a great out of season storm cloud rose up with seven days of rainy weather cold winds intense darkness then muccalinda the n ga king leaving his dwelling place and encircling the blessed one s body seven times with his coils stood with his great hood spread over the blessed one thinking don t let the blessed one be disturbed by cold don t let the blessed one be disturbed by heat don t let the blessed one be disturbed by the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun creeping things then with the passing of seven days the blessed one emerged from that concentration muccalinda the n ga king realizing that the sky had cleared and was free of clouds unraveled his coils from the body of the blessed one dropped his own appearance and assuming the appearance of a young man stood in front of the blessed one with hands before his heart paying homage then on realizing the significance of that the blessed one on that occasion exclaimed blissful is solitude for one who s content who has heard the dhamma who sees blissful is non affliction with regard for the world restraint for living beings blissful is dispassion with regard for the world the overcoming of sensuality but the subduing of the conceit i am monks these eight worldly conditions spin after the world and the world spins after these eight worldly conditions which eight gain loss status disgrace censure praise pleasure pain these are the eight worldly conditions that spin after the world and the world spins after these eight worldly conditions for an uninstructed run of the mill person there arise gain loss status disgrace censure praise pleasure pain for a well instructed disciple of the noble ones there also arise gain loss status disgrace censure praise pleasure pain so what difference what distinction what distinguishing factor is there between the well instructed disciple of the noble ones and the uninstructed run of the mill person for us lord the teachings have the blessed one as their root their guide their arbitrator it would be good if the blessed one himself would explicate the meaning of this statement having heard it from the blessed one the monks will remember it in that case monks listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said gain arises for an uninstructed run of the mill person he does not reflect gain has arisen for me it is inconstant stressful subject to change he does not discern it as it actually is loss arises status arises disgrace arises censure arises praise arises pleasure arises pain arises he does not reflect pain has arisen for me it is inconstant stressful subject to change he does not discern it as it actually is his mind remains consumed with the gain his mind remains consumed with the loss with the status the disgrace the censure the praise the pleasure his mind remains consumed with the pain he welcomes the arisen gain and rebels against the arisen loss he welcomes the arisen status and rebels against the arisen disgrace he welcomes the arisen praise and rebels against the arisen censure he welcomes the arisen pleasure and rebels against the arisen pain as he is thus engaged in welcoming rebelling he is not released from birth aging or death from sorrows lamentations pains distresses or despairs he is not released i tell you from suffering stress now gain arises for a well instructed disciple of the noble ones he reflects gain has arisen for me it is inconstant stressful subject to change he discerns it as it actually is loss arises status arises disgrace arises censure arises praise arises pleasure arises pain arises he reflects pain has arisen for me it is inconstant stressful subject to change he discerns it as it actually is his mind does not remain consumed with the gain his mind does not remain consumed with the loss with the status the disgrace the censure the praise the pleasure his mind does not remain consumed with the pain he does not welcome the arisen gain or rebel against the arisen loss he does not welcome the arisen status or rebel against the arisen disgrace he does not welcome the arisen praise or rebel against the arisen censure he does not welcome the arisen pleasure or rebel against the arisen pain as he thus abandons welcoming rebelling he is released from birth aging death from sorrows lamentations pains distresses despairs he is released i tell you from suffering stress this is the difference this the distinction this the distinguishing factor between the well instructed disciple of the noble ones and the uninstructed run of the mill person gain loss status disgrace censure praise pleasure pain these conditions among human beings are inconstant impermanent subject to change knowing this the wise person mindful ponders these changing conditions desirable things don t charm the mind undesirable ones bring no resistance his welcoming rebelling are scattered gone to their end do not exist knowing the dustless sorrowless state he discerns rightly has gone beyond becoming to the further shore at savatthi monks i will teach you the phenomena to be comprehended as well as comprehension listen pay close attention i will speak as you say lord the monks responded the blessed one said and which are the phenomena to be comprehended form is a phenomenon to be comprehended feeling perception fabrications consciousness is a phenomenon to be comprehended these are called phenomena to be comprehended and which is comprehension any ending of passion ending of aversion ending of delusion
