the sons of aaron took each of them his censer and put fire therein and laid incense thereon and offered strange fire before the lord which he had not commanded them and there came forth fire from before the lord and devoured them and they died before the lord then moses said unto aaron this is it that the lord spoke saying through them that are nigh unto me i will be sanctified and before all the people i will be glorified and aaron held his peace and moses called mishael and elzaphan the sons of uzziel the uncle of aaron and said unto them draw near carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp so they drew near and carried them in their tunics out of the camp as moses had said and moses said unto aaron and unto eleazar and unto ithamar his sons let not the hair of your heads go loose neither rend your clothes that ye die not and that he be not wroth with all the congregation but let your brethren the whole house of israel bewail the burning which the lord hath kindled and ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting lest ye die for the anointing oil of the lord is upon you and they did according to the word of moses and the lord spoke unto aaron

and moses spoke unto aaron and unto eleazar and unto ithamar his sons that were left take the meal offering that remaineth of the offerings of the lord made by fire and eat it without leaven beside the altar for it is most holy and ye shall eat it in a holy place because it is thy due and thy sons due of the offerings of the lord made by fire for so i am commanded and the breast of waving and the thigh of heaving shall ye eat in a clean place thou and thy sons and thy daughters with thee for they are given as thy due and thy sons due out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the

from the holy things of the children of israel which they hallow unto me and that they profane not my holy name i am the lord say unto them whosoever he be of all your seed throughout your generations

even and shall not eat of the holy things unless he bathe his flesh in water and when the sun is down he shall be clean and afterward he may eat of the holy things because it is his bread that which dieth of itself or is torn of beasts he shall not eat to defile himself therewith i am the lord they shall therefore keep my charge lest they bear sin for it and die therein if they profane it i am the lord who sanctify them there shall no common man eat of the holy thing a tenant of a priest or a hired servant shall not eat of the holy thing but if a priest buy any soul the purchase of his money he may eat of it and such as are born in his house they may eat of his bread and if a priest s daughter be married unto a common man she shall not eat of that which is set apart from the holy things but if a priest s daughter be a widow or divorced and have no child and is returned unto her father s house as in her youth she may eat of her father s bread but there shall no common man eat thereof and if a man eat of the holy thing through error then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it and shall give unto the priest the holy thing and they shall not profane the holy things of the children of israel which they set apart unto the lord and so cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt when they eat their holy things for i am the lord who sanctify them and the lord

place any figured stone in your land to bow down unto it for i am the lord your god ye shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary i am the lord if ye walk in my statutes and keep my commandments and do them then i will give your rains in their season and the land shall yield her produce and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit and your threshing shall reach unto the vintage and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time and ye shall eat your bread until ye have enough and dwell in your land safely and i will give peace in the land and ye shall lie down and none shall make you afraid and i will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land neither shall the sword go through your land and ye shall chase your enemies and they shall fall before you by the sword and five of you shall chase a hundred and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword and i will have respect unto you and make you fruitful and multiply you and will establish my covenant with you and ye shall eat old store long kept and ye shall bring forth the old from before the new and i will set my tabernacle among you and my soul shall not abhor you and i will walk among you and will be your god and ye shall be my people i am the lord your god who brought you forth out of the land of egypt that ye should not be their bondmen and i have broken the bars of your yoke and made you go upright but if ye will not hearken unto me and will not do all these commandments and if ye shall reject my statutes and if your soul abhor mine ordinances so that ye will not do all my commandments but break my covenant i also will do this unto you i will appoint terror over you even consumption and fever that shall make the eyes to fail and the soul to languish and ye shall sow your seed in vain for your enemies shall eat it and i will set my face against you and ye shall be smitten before your enemies they that hate you shall rule over you and ye shall flee when none pursueth you and if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me then i will chastise you seven times more for your sins and i will break the pride of your power and i will make your heaven as iron and your earth as brass and your strength shall be spent in vain for your land shall not yield her produce neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit and if ye walk contrary unto me and will not hearken unto me i will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins and i will send the beast of the field among you which shall rob you of your children and destroy your cattle and make you few in number and your ways shall become desolate and if in spite of these things ye will not be corrected unto me but will walk contrary unto me then will i also walk contrary unto you and i will smite you even i seven times for your sins and i will bring a sword upon you that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant and ye shall be gathered together within your cities and i will send the pestilence among you and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy when i break your staff of bread ten women shall bake your bread in one oven and they shall deliver your bread again by weight and ye shall eat and not be satisfied s and if ye will not for all this hearken unto me but walk contrary unto me then i will walk contrary unto you in fury and i also will chastise you seven times for your sins and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat and i will destroy your high places and cut down your sun pillars and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols and my soul shall abhor you and i will make your cities a waste and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation and i will not smell the savour of your sweet odours and i will bring the land into desolation and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it and you will i scatter among the nations and i will draw out the sword after you and your land shall be a desolation and your cities shall be a waste then shall the land be paid her sabbaths as long as it lieth desolate and ye are in your enemies land even then shall the land rest and repay her sabbaths as long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths when ye dwelt upon it and as for them that are left of you i will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them and they shall flee as one fleeth from the sword and they shall fall when none pursueth and they shall stumble one upon another as it were before the sword when none pursueth and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies and ye shall perish among the nations and the land of your enemies shall eat you up and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies lands and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them and they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers in their treachery which they committed against me and also that they have walked contrary unto me i also will walk contrary unto them and bring them into the land of their enemies if then perchance their uncircumcised heart be humbled and they then be paid the punishment of their iniquity then will i remember my covenant with jacob and also my covenant with isaac and also my covenant with abraham will i remember and i will remember the land for the land shall lie forsaken without them and shall be paid her sabbaths while she lieth desolate without them and they shall be paid the punishment of their iniquity because even because they rejected mine ordinances and their soul abhorred my statutes and yet for all that when they are in the land of their enemies i will not reject them neither will i abhor them to destroy them utterly and to break my covenant with them for i am the lord their god but i will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt in the sight of the nations that i might be their god i am the lord these are the statutes and ordinances and laws which the lord made between him and the children of israel in mount sinai by the hand of moses and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say

it be a beast whereof men bring an offering unto the lord all that any man giveth of such unto the lord shall be holy he shall not alter it nor change it a good for a bad or a bad for a good and if he shall at all change beast for beast then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy and if it be any unclean beast of which they may not bring an offering unto the lord then he shall set

to him and if he will not redeem the field or if he have sold the field to another man it shall not be redeemed any more but the field when it goeth out in the jubilee shall be holy unto the lord as a field devoted the possession thereof shall be the priest s and if he sanctify unto the lord a field which he hath bought which is not of the field of his possession then the priest shall reckon unto

bought even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth and all thy valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary twenty gerahs shall be the shekel howbeit the firstling among

and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof or if it be not redeemed then it shall be sold according to thy valuation notwithstanding no devoted thing that a man may devote unto the lord of all that he hath whether of man or beast or of the field of his possession shall be sold or redeemed every devoted thing is most holy unto the lord none devoted that may be devoted of men shall be ransomed he shall surely be put to death and all the tithe of the land whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree is the lord s it is holy unto the lord and if a man will redeem aught of his
